System Architecture for Autonomous Vehicles An ordinary vehicle can be converted into an autonomous one by adding some additional components including sensors that allow the vehicle to make its own decisions by sensing the environment and controlling the mobility of the vehicle . Figure 1 illustrates the overall communication process/protocol in AVs and also lists the sensors, actuators, hardware and the software control required. The protocol architecture, explained below, is composed of four main stages and enables a Level 5 fully autonomous vehicle where all the users are passengers.", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2164511010", "name": "Qasim Ahmed"}], "citations": []}
