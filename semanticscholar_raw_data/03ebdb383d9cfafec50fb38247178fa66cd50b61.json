This is problematic in today\u2019s context when volume of data gets larger each day and the need to process data quickly is essential. Hence, in this paper we propose a platform that allows running clustering algorithms in a distributed manner. This is achieved through splitting the data into smaller and equal partitions, and through redesigning the original clustering algorithms to allow working on a sub-set of the input data without having to interact with the processing of the rest of the input data. At the end the so-called reduce phase aggregates the partial results obtained from processing each partition and it produces the global result.", "venue": "International Symposium on Applied Computational Intelligence and Informatics", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2019-05-01", "journal": {"name": "2019 IEEE 13th International Symposium on Applied Computational Intelligence and Informatics (SACI)", "pages": "217-222"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3081594", "name": "I.
