The field of large-scale global optimization is concerned with improving the scalability of global optimization algorithms, particularly, population-based metaheuristics. Such metaheuristics have been successfully applied to continuous, discrete, or combinatorial problems ranging from several thousand dimensions to billions of decision variables. In this two-part survey, we review recent studies in the field of large-scale black-box global optimization to help researchers and practitioners gain a bird\u2019s-eye view of the field, learn about its major trends, and the state-of-the-art algorithms. Part I of the series covers two major algorithmic approaches to large-scale global optimization: 1) problem decomposition and 2) memetic algorithms. Part II of the series covers a range of other algorithmic approaches to large-scale global optimization, describes a wide range of problem areas, and finally, touches upon the pitfalls and challenges of current research and identifies several potential areas for future research.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-10-01", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation", "pages": "802-822", "volume": "26"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2636102", "name": "M.
