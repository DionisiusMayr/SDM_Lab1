In this paper, we are conducting an in-depth analysis on the software features\u2019 impact on the performance of deep learning-based software defect predictors. We further extend a large-scale feature set proposed in the literature for detecting defect-proneness, by adding conceptual software features that capture the semantics of the source code, including comments. The conceptual features are automatically engineered using Doc2Vec, an artificial neural network based prediction model. A broad evaluation performed on the Calcite software system highlights a statistically significant improvement obtained by applying deep learning-based classifiers for detecting software defects when using conceptual features extracted from the source code for characterizing the software entities.", "venue": "IEEE Access", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "IEEE Access", "pages": "64801-64818", "volume": "10"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "8788324", "name": "Diana-Lucia Miholca"}, {"authorId": "1752880739", "name": "Vlad-Ioan Tomescu"}, {"authorId": "1695873", "name": "G.
