Fog computing is the paradigm where fog devices help to reduce latency and increase throughput for assisting at the edge of the client. This paper discussed the emergence of fog computing for mining analytics in big data from geospatial and medical health applications. This paper proposed and developed fog computing based framework i.e. FogLearn for application of K-means clustering in Ganga River Basin Management and real world feature data for detecting diabetes patients suffering from diabetes mellitus. Proposed architecture employed machine learning on deep learning framework for analysis of pathological feature data that obtained from smart watches worn by the patients with diabetes and geographical parameters of River Ganga basin geospatial database. The results showed that fog computing hold an immense promise for analysis of medical and geospatial big data.", "venue": "International Journal of Fog Computing", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2017-12-26", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/1712.09282"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "34688005", "name": "Rabindra Kumar Barik"}, {"authorId": "31712192", "name": "R.
