In addition, 6G adopts an average of 1000+ massive number of connections per person in one decade (2030 virtually instantaneously). The data-driven network is a novel service paradigm that offers a new application for the future of 6G wireless communication and network architecture. It enables ultra-reliable and low latency communication (URLLC) enhancing information transmission up to around 1 Tb/s data rate while achieving a 0.1 millisecond transmission latency. The main limitation of this technique is the computational power available for distributing with big data and greatly designed artificial neural networks. The work carried out in this paper aims to highlight improvements to the multi-level architecture by enabling artificial intelligence (AI) in URLLC providing a new technique in designing wireless networks. This is done through the application of learning, predicting, and decision-making to manage the stream of individuals trained by big data. The secondary aim of this research paper is to improve a multi-level architecture. This enables user level for device intelligence, cell level for edge intelligence, and cloud intelligence for URLLC. The improvement mainly depends on using the training process in unsupervised learning by developing data-driven resource management. In addition, improving a multi-level architecture for URLLC through deep learning (DL) would facilitate the creation of a data-driven AI system, 6G networks for intelligent devices, and technologies based on an effective learning capability. These investigational problems are essential in addressing the requirements in the creation of future smart networks. Moreover, this work provides further ideas on several research gaps between DL and 6G that are up-to-date unknown.", "venue": "IEEE Access", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "IEEE Access", "pages": "55098-55131", "volume": "9"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "32557756", "name": "A.
