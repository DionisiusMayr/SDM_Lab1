It is the most direct reflection of a country's development level and comprehensive national strength, and also opens up broad space for its future sustainable development. This article mainly aims at the library reader information management based on genetic algorithm and puts forward my own opinions. The system adopts B/S structure and MySQL database technology to realize the modular combination design of the system functions, and takes the library information management system as the core subsystem to develop a set of intelligent material dynamic web pages that are suitable for personalized demand analysis of books and have strong data integration and processing capabilities and are easy to maintain. After that, this paper uses simulation to test the function of the system's operation module. The test results show that the library and information personalized information service management system based on improved genetic algorithm operates normally, is compatible with the platform, and has a short running delay, which shows that the system can meet the needs of users.", "venue": "2023 International Conference on Distributed Computing and Electrical Circuits and Electronics (ICDCECE)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-04-29", "journal": {"name": "2023 International Conference on Distributed Computing and Electrical Circuits and Electronics (ICDCECE)", "pages": "1-6"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2108623786", "name": "Yuqi Yang"}], "citations": []}
