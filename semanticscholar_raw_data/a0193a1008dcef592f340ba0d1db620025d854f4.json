Security admin-istrators and Law Enforcement Agency (LEA) of\ufb01cers call for powerful tools capable of providing network communication analysis of an enormous amount of network traf\ufb01c as well as capable of analyzing an incomplete network data. Big data technologies were considered to implement tools for capturing, processing and storing packet traces representing network communication. Often, these systems are resource intensive requiring a signi\ufb01cant amount of memory, computing power, and disk space. The presented paper describes a novel approach to real-time network traf\ufb01c processing implemented in a distributed environment. The key difference to most existing systems is that the system is based on a light-weight actor model. The whole processing pipeline is represented in terms of actor nodes that can run in parallel. Also, the actor-model offers a solution that is highly con\ufb01gurable and scalable. The preliminary evaluation of a prototype implementation supports these general statements.", "venue": "", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "1396174459", "name": "Viliam Letavay"}, {"authorId": "3334366", "name": "J.
