Smart cities, with their interconnected and intelligent infrastructure combined with advanced technologies, provide an ideal environment for promoting green initiatives. This paper presents a comprehensive survey that aims to highlight the role of geospatial big data technologies in the assertion of green smart cities. Indeed, we show how geospatial big data contributes to solving environmental issues related to cities such as air pollution, water pollution, green zones and biodiversity loss, climate change, and the efficient management of energy and renewable energy. Additionally, this paper suggests a basic and general geospatial big data architecture and presents the main open-source frameworks that can aid in the development of such big data systems for sustainable and green city planners.", "venue": "International Conference on Cyberworlds", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-10-03", "journal": {"name": "2023 International Conference on Cyberworlds (CW)", "pages": "217-224"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2212093815", "name": "Yassine Gacha"}, {"authorId": "2206503203", "name": "Mohamed Amine Ben Rhaiem"}, {"authorId": "2187552", "name": "Takoua Abdellatif"}], "citations": []}
