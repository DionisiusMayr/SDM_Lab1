So much data will undoubtedly bring people a vast amount of information, but the difficulty of finding useful knowledge for the enterprise or individual from the vast amount of data has increased. And cloud computing platform can perform dynamic resource scheduling and allocation, with the characteristics of highly virtualization and high availability, which meets the needs of efficient data mining. The cloud computing technology combined with the existing data mining technology has been regarded as a kind of feasible way for efficiency.", "venue": "2014 IEEE Workshop on Advanced Research and Technology in Industry Applications (WARTIA)", "year": 2014, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2014-12-08", "journal": {"name": "2014 IEEE Workshop on Advanced Research and Technology in Industry Applications (WARTIA)", "pages": "163-165"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2072782325", "name": "Zhu Jia"}, {"authorId": "2099517976", "name": "Zhang Ping"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "837dbf8af1e0449f43591eb30de49deb9727dfab", "title": "Data Processing in CPSS Platform based on Data Mining"}, {"paperId": "602f352da6088d4e4861cb217d3aae84a351da9e", "title": "Efficient Group Based Data Retrieval from Cloud Storage using Data Mining Technique"}]}
