Quantization is one of the widely used solutions to reduce the size of a model. For parameter representation, it employs for example just 8-bit integer or less instead of 32-bit floating point. The TensorFlow Lite deep learning framework currently provides four methods for post-training quantization. The aim of this paper is to benchmark these quantization methods using various deep neural models of different sizes. The main outcomes of the paper are: (1) the compression ratio obtained for each quantization method for deep neural models of small, medium, and large sizes, (2) a comparison of the accuracy results relative to the original accuracy, and (3) a viewpoint for the decision to choose the quantization method depending on the model size.", "venue": "International Symposium on Applied Computational Intelligence and Informatics", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-05-25", "journal": {"name": "2022 IEEE 16th International Symposium on Applied Computational Intelligence and Informatics (SACI)", "pages": "000221-000226"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2188876785", "name": "Ioan Lucan Or\u0103\u0219an"}, {"authorId": "1774192", "name": "Ciprian Seiculescu"}, {"authorId": "32693028", "name": "C.
