These models are becoming increasingly complex and powerful to train and serve. This growth in capabilities comes with a substantial increase in computational requirements, both in terms of hardware resources and energy consumption. The goal of this paper is to showcase how hardware and software co-design can come together and allow us to create customized hardware systems for specific LLM workloads. We propose a simulation workflow that allows us to combine model parallelism techniques with a multi-accelerator simulation framework for efficiency metrics. We focus on inference workloads and report power, cycle, and latency metrics upon performing a design space exploration search over multiple software and hardware configurations.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-12-24", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2312.15388"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2282139677", "name": "Ekansh Agrawal"}, {"authorId": "2276485354", "name": "Xiangyu Sam Xu"}], "citations": []}
