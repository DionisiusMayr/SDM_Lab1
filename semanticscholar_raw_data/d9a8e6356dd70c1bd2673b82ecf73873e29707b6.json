Deep learning has been proven to be very effective in these domains and is pervasively used by many Internet services. In this paper, we describe different automotive uses cases for deep learning in particular in the domain of computer vision. We surveys the current state-of-the-art in libraries, tools and infrastructures (e. g. GPUs and clouds) for implementing, training and deploying deep neural networks. We particularly focus on convolutional neural networks and computer vision use cases, such as the visual inspection process in manufacturing plants and the analysis of social media data. To train neural networks, curated and labeled datasets are essential. In particular, both the availability and scope of such datasets is typically very limited. A main contribution of this paper is the creation of an automotive dataset, that allows us to learn and automatically recognize different vehicle properties. We describe an end-to-end deep learning application utilizing a mobile app for data collection and process support, and an Amazon-based cloud backend for storage and training. For training we evaluate the use of cloud and on-premises infrastructures (including multiple GPUs) in conjunction with different neural network architectures and frameworks. We assess both the training times as well as the accuracy of the classifier. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the trained classifier in a real world setting during manufacturing process. I. INTRODUCTION Machine learning and deep learning has many potential applications in the automotive domain both inside the vehicle , e. g. advanced driving assistance systems (ADAS), autonomous driving, and outside the vehicle, e. g. during development , manufacturing and sales & aftersales processes. Machine learning is an essential component for use cases, such as predictive maintenance of vehicles, personalized infotainment and location-based services, business process automation, supply chain and price optimization. A common challenge of these applications is the need for storage and processing of large volumes of data as well as the necessity to deal with unstructured data (videos, images, text), e. g. from camera-based sensors on the vehicle or machines in the manufacturing process. To effectively utilize this kind of data, new methods, such as deep learning, are required.
