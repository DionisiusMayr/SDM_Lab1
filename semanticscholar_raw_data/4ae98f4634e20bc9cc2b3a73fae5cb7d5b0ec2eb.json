Networks have to be monitored constantly and protected against attacks. In this paper, a new method to analyze network traffic using Big Data techniques is introduced. This approach detects anomalous activities being carried out and malicious data being transmitted over the networks through processing and loading traffic data into Hive database in Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) environment, and analyzing the data using Hive queries. The results of using this method to detect attacks on the sample dataset are also presented.", "venue": "SoutheastCon", "year": 2016, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2016-03-01", "journal": {"name": "SoutheastCon 2016", "pages": "1-4"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "30723427", "name": "Yogeshwar Rao Bachupally"}, {"authorId": "143893172", "name": "Xiaohong Yuan"}, {"authorId": "123313777", "name": "K.
