The design of wireless base stations will evolve over time, and reconfigurable processing is essential to supporting current and future requirements, as well as meeting dynamic factors and evolving standards. With the rapid advancement of wireless standardization, new services and features are being developed at a much faster rate than previously possible. The Chameleon reconfigurable processor allows developers to work on algorithm prototype models on development modules.", "venue": "2022 2nd International Conference on Technological Advancements in Computational Sciences (ICTACS)", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-10-10", "journal": {"name": "2022 2nd International Conference on Technological Advancements in Computational Sciences (ICTACS)", "pages": "811-816"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1573795618", "name": "Dhiraj Kapila"}, {"authorId": "2103850059", "name": "T.
