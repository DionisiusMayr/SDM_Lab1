Defined interoperability levels are mapped against the Open System Interconnection Model layers resulting in bridging the classical and the modern methodology. The clinical integration of eHealth consumer electronic technology is assessed according to the aforementioned terminology and methodology. The Cloud-based Open Telemedicine Interoperability Hub is demonstrated, summarized and validated as a link between classical healthcare information system architecture and emerging eHealth consumer electronics technology. This scientific research program is the manifestation of the trilateral cooperation among the University of Debrecen Faculty of Informatics, Semmelweis University 2nd Pediatric Clinic Department of Pulmonology and an industry partner. The demonstrated interoperability framework relies upon and intends to extend health level seven international standard for open healthcare systems interoperability. The novelty of this research is, that the presented Open Telemedicine Interoperability Hub is embedded in hybrid Cloud Architecture, and therefore it delivers the necessary highly improved transactional processing capacity that other contemporary technologies lack.", "venue": "International Symposium on Applied Machine Intelligence and Informatics", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering"], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "2017 IEEE 15th International Symposium on Applied Machine Intelligence and Informatics (SAMI)", "pages": "000411-000416"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3431539", "name": "Abel Garai"}, {"authorId": "2977194", "name": "A.
