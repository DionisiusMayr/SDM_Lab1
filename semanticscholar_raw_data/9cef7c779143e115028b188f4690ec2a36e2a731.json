Fully realizing this potential requires fundamental changes in how system software manages, protects, and provides access to data that resides in NVMM. We address these needs by describing a NVMM-optimized file system called NOVA that is both fast and resilient in the face of corruption due to media errors and software bugs. We identify and propose solutions for the unique challenges in hardening an NVMM file system, adapt state-of-the-art reliability techniques to an NVMM file system, and quantify the performance and storage overheads of these techniques. We find that NOVA\u2019s reliability features increase file system size system size by 14.9% and reduce application-level performance by between 2% and 38%.", "venue": "", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2110980061", "name": "Jian Xu"}, {"authorId": "2156146812", "name": "Lu Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2138575", "name": "Amirsaman Memaripour"}, {"authorId": "48051642", "name": "Akshatha Gangadharaiah"}, {"authorId": "27030201", "name": "Amit Borase"}, {"authorId": "26969671", "name": "Tamires Brito Da Silva"}, {"authorId": "16878826", "name": "A.
