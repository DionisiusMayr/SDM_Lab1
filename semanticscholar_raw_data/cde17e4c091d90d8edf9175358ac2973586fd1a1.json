Leveraging hardware accelerators (GPUs, FPGAs, and ASICs) to accelerate computationally-intensive algorithms like sequence alignment has become paramount. Recently, the wavefront alignment algorithm was introduced, significantly reducing the execution time to perform sequence alignment. This paper presents the first-ever ASIC accelerator of the WFA integrated into a RISC-V system-on-chip. Our designed chip greatly accelerates sequence alignment, delivering up to 1076 \u00d7 better performance over the CPU implementation of the WFA running on the RISC-V core of the chip.", "venue": "International Conference on Parallel Processing", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-08-07", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 52nd International Conference on Parallel Processing"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "72927570", "name": "A.
