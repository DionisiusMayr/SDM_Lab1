In this paper, we present a survey and tutorial for multimedia big data. After discussing the characteristics of multimedia big data such as human-centricity, multimodality, heterogeneity, unprecedented volume, and so on, this paper provides an overview of the state-of-the-art of multimedia big data, reviews the latest related technologies, and discusses the technical challenges. We conclude this paper with a discussion of open problems and future directions.", "venue": "China Communications", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2018-02-12", "journal": {"name": "China Communications", "pages": "155-176", "volume": "15"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2101348", "name": "Zaijian Wang"}, {"authorId": "145536403", "name": "S.
