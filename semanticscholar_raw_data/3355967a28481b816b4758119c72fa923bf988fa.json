Cloud computing is important because it allows for scalability, adaptability, and improved security. Likewise, privacy in cloud computing is important because it ensures that the integrity of data stored on the cloud maintains intact. This survey paper on privacy-preserving cloud computing can help pave the way for future research in related areas. This paper helps to identify existing trends by establishing a layered architecture along with a life cycle and an ecosystem for privacy-preserving cloud systems in addition to identifying the existing trends in research on this area.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-04-23", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2204.11120"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2066247360", "name": "Saeed Ahmadi"}, {"authorId": "2163449771", "name": "Maliheh Salehfar"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "dda9f2d7eaa30626c7374934ba23d3e413428f3b", "title": "Enhanced mechanism to prioritize the cloud data privacy factors using AHP and TOPSIS: a hybrid approach"}]}
