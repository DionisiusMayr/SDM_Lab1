It's urgently needed to develop and implement new evaluation methods to assess the visualization of maritime data. In this paper, we explore both quantitative and qualitative evaluation approaches to define evaluative metrics of our interactive visualization techniques, and present a case study carrying out by domain researches in real setting. This work is an important part to complement the visual analytics for maritime operations.", "venue": "Techno-Ocean", "year": 2016, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "2016 Techno-Ocean (Techno-Ocean)", "pages": "471-477"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "9543036", "name": "Xu Zhuge"}, {"authorId": "2144222486", "name": "Hao Wang"}, {"authorId": "2313038", "name": "Girts Strazdins"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "af3b8f446b7db459f33e3cb77864dd8b3bc84c3c", "title": "A data-driven method for optimal control of ship motions for safe crew transfer to offshore wind turbines"}, {"paperId": "5a3156131eea37da1521182479b7601887133978", "title": "Large scale integration of wireless sensor network technologies for air quality monitoring at a logistics shipping base"}, {"paperId": "2aea78fcf25fe494e5a9f9f75c3480a59769ef95", "title": "Data dimension reduction for visual analytics: A case study of oil-in-water detection"}, {"paperId": "7e41af90607cfdd06ba9b9d66d2d1763d4d87975", "title": "Organizing data from industrial internet of things for maritime operations"}]}
