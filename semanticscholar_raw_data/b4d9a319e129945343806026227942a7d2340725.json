In VANETs, VFC (Vehicular Fog Computing) technology establishes vehicles, edge, and cloud as resource-providing infrastructures. However, the use of VFC as infrastructure for pedestrians is still limited, with few works addressing computational offloading in such a scenario. In this context, we implemented a decision algorithm for the offloading process based on resources provided by VFC to guarantee better offloading and latency rates. The results showed that the implemented algorithm obtained efficiency rates above 90% in the tested scenarios and a reduction of up to 40% in the offloading execution time compared to a random approach tested.", "venue": "2022 IEEE 11th International Conference on Cloud Networking (CloudNet)", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-11-07", "journal": {"name": "2022 IEEE 11th International Conference on Cloud Networking (CloudNet)", "pages": "126-130"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2051299846", "name": "P.
