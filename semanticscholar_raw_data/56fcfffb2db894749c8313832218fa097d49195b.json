In this work, we introduce an idea for the community to further explore. We embed the idea in TaskFlow: a makespan conservative, energy-aware task placement policy for workflow scheduling. Using static, rough numbers and simulation, we obtain energy savings between [4.24, 47.00]% and [0.1, 13.6]%, respectively. We also present some pitfalls that should be investigated further, notably starvation of large tasks when using TaskFlow.", "venue": "International Conference on Performance Engineering", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-07-14", "journal": {"name": "Companion of the 2022 ACM/SPEC International Conference on Performance Engineering"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "46579215", "name": "L.
