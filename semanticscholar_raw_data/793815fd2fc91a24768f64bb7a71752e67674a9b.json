In order to provide an in-depth study on the closed network operations, we advocate a novel approach via two-level, device-centric machine learning that can open up the system behaviors and facilitate fine-grained analysis . We describe our proposed approach, and use the latency analysis on two popular mobile apps (Web browsing and Instant Messaging) to illustrate how our scheme works. We further preliminary results and discuss the open issues.", "venue": "International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2018-07-01", "journal": {"name": "2018 27th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN)", "pages": "1-9"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3013173", "name": "Zengwen Yuan"}, {"authorId": "2864629", "name": "Yuanjie Li"}, {"authorId": "1798566", "name": "Chunyi Peng"}, {"authorId": "2014352", "name": "Songwu Lu"}, {"authorId": "3055083", "name": "Haotian Deng"}, {"authorId": "3385382", "name": "Zhaowei Tan"}, {"authorId": "145705387", "name": "T.
