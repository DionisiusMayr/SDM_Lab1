In local domain, various contents (e.g. menus, themes, advertisements, etc.) are also recommended in this way. However, it is challenging to recommend the most relevant content by using one recommender system, as user contexts (e.g. area, time, etc.), user features (e.g. age, gender, preference, etc.), and contents are very various and complex. In this paper, we propose an empirical hyper-personalization problem reflecting user behavior in local domain, that is considered as contextual bandit problem with well-configured recommender system ensemble. We empirically introduce how to deal with insufficient user feedbacks in service by using feedbacks of other interfaces (e.g. search and feed platform app/web, map platform app/web), how to define user contexts and user features in local domain, and how to ensemble contextual bandits for optimization, called \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc35 (Local Ensemble Contextual Bandit). Furthermore, we show how well the model performs and how it works for hyper-personalization in service.", "venue": "BehavRec@RecSys", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2204974199", "name": "Junhyung Kim"}, {"authorId": "2271962207", "name": "Kijun Kwon"}, {"authorId": "2273062982", "name": "Jinho Kim"}], "citations": []}
