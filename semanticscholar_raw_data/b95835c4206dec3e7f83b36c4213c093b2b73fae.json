(De l'\u00e9valuation r\u00e9partie et efficace de requ\u00eates SPARQL)", "abstract": "The Semantic Web standardized by the World Wide Web Consortium aims at providing a common framework that allows data to be shared and analyzed across applications. Thereby, it introduced as common base for data the Resource Description Framework (rdf) and its query language sparql.Because of the increasing amounts of rdf data available, dataset distribution across clusters is poised to become a standard storage method. As a consequence, efficient and distributed sparql evaluators are needed.To tackle these needs, we first benchmark several state-of-the-art distributed sparql evaluators while adapting the considered set of metrics to a distributed context such as e.g. network traffic. Then, an analysis driven by typical use cases leads us to define new development areas in the field of distributed sparql evaluation. On the basis of these fresh perspectives, we design several efficient distributed sparql evaluators which fit into each of these use cases and whose performances are validated compared with the already benchmarked evaluators. For instance, our distributed sparql evaluator named sparqlgx offers efficient time performances while being resilient to the loss of nodes.", "venue": "", "year": 2016, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2016-12-15", "journal": {"name": "", "volume": ""}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2235966", "name": "D.
