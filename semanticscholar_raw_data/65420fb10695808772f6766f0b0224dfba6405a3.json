Large-scale datacenter operators have identified this coupling as a root cause behind fleetwide resource underutilization and increasing Total Cost of Ownership (TCO). With the advent of ultra-fast networks and cache-coherent interfaces, memory disaggregation has emerged as a potential solution, whereby applications can leverage available memory even outside server boundaries. This paper summarizes the growing research landscape of memory disaggregation from a software perspective and introduces the challenges toward making it practical under current and future hardware trends. We also reflect on our seven-year journey in the SymbioticLab to build a comprehensive disaggregated memory system over ultra-fast networks. We conclude with some open challenges toward building next-generation memory disaggregation systems leveraging emerging cache-coherent interconnects.", "venue": "ACM SIGOPS Operating Systems Review", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-05-06", "journal": {"name": "ACM SIGOPS Operating Systems Review", "pages": "29 - 37", "volume": "57"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2221258", "name": "H.
