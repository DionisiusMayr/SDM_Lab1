Wikipedia designed a quality scale, but with such a manual assessment process, many articles remain unassessed. We review existing methods for automatically measuring the quality of Wikipedia articles, identifying and comparing machine learning algorithms, article features, quality metrics, and used datasets, examining 149distinct studies, and exploring commonalities and gaps in them. The literature is extensive, and the approaches follow past technological trends. However, machine learning is still not widely used by Wikipedia, and we hope that our analysis helps future researchers change that reality.", "venue": "ACM Computing Surveys", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-09-22", "journal": {"name": "ACM Computing Surveys", "pages": "1 - 37", "volume": "56"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2243965704", "name": "Pedro Miguel Mo\u00e1s"}, {"authorId": "2243965288", "name": "Carla Teixeira Lopes"}], "citations": []}
