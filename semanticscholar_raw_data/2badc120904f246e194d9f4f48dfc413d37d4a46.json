Under an arbitrary objective function, this family of problems is known to be an -complete combinatorial optimization problem. We study this problem under a broad family of objective functions characterized by elementary symmetric polynomials, which are \u201cbuilding blocks\u201d to symmetric functions. By analyzing a continuous relaxation of the problem, we identify conditions that enable the use of a reformulation technique in which the set partitioning problem is cast as a more tractable network flow problem solvable in polynomial-time. We show that a number of results from the literature arise as special cases of our proposed framework, highlighting its generality. We demonstrate the usefulness of the developed methodology through a novel and timely application of quarantining heterogeneous populations in an optimal manner. Our case study on real COVID-19 data reveals significant benefits over conventional measures in terms of both spread mitigation and economic impact, underscoring the importance of data-driven policies.", "venue": "IISE Transactions", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2023-03-16", "journal": {"name": "IISE Transactions", "pages": "143 - 155", "volume": "56"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2211900186", "name": "Jiayi Lin"}, {"authorId": "49966869", "name": "Hrayer Aprahamian"}, {"authorId": "102899521", "name": "H.
