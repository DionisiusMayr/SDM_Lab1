In dynamic networks, where both the mobile fog nodes and the end users exhibit time-varying characteristics, including dynamic network topology changes, there is a need of mobility-aware fog computing, which is very challenging due to various dynamisms, and yet systematically uncovered. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on the fog computing compliant with the OpenFog (IEEE 1934) standardised concept, where the mobility of fog nodes constitutes an integral part. A review of the state-of-the-art research in fog computing implemented with mobile nodes is conducted. The review includes the identification of several models of fog computing concept established on the principles of opportunistic networking, social communities, temporal networks, and vehicular ad-hoc networks. Relevant to these models, the contributing research studies are critically examined to provide an insight into the open issues and future research directions in mobile fog computing research.", "venue": "", "year": null, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2292279740", "name": "Krzysztof Ostrowski"}, {"authorId": "2292283318", "name": "Krzysztof Ma\u0142ecki"}, {"authorId": "2292279060", "name": "Piotr Dziurza\u0144ski"}, {"authorId": "2292350615", "name": "Kumar Singh"}], "citations": []}
