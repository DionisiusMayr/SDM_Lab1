The analysis of variance (ANOVA), which produced concurrences, contained 41 scholars in two distinct emplacements amidst a Madurese-scholars preponderance and the different amounts in groups. Several significant conclusions emerged from the current ANOVA analysis. First, the comprehensive implication betwixt MALL listening-reading-appliance and direct-listening-reading-appliance to scholar\u2019s L2-VK listening-reading competencies was not substantiated because it was more than level significant (0.440>0.05). Second, we convened cognizance by direct perception, inside and outside deliberation, and documented it. Third, the cross-examination eventualities of perception-documentation were coded, and research eventualities established the Madurese-scholar higher education framework to pervade case study evidence vacuity that aims to scrutinize: i) the Madurese-scholar teaching-learning peculiarities performance of MALL-VCT-Zoom and Smart-TV multimedia edification; ii) Madurese-scholar interminable concurrences in MALL-VCT-Zoom and Smart-TV; and iii) impediments obtain by MALL-VCT-Zoom and Smart-TV during participation in edification. Irrevocably, concurrence betwixt MALL-VCT-Zoom and smart-TV to scholars\u2019 L2-VK listening-reading competencies were interrelated impacts as Madurese-scholars can learn conveniently with their necessity and concurrently utilize smart-TV or Zoom despite their impediments.", "venue": "International Journal of Evaluation and Research in Education (IJERE)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-12-01", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Evaluation and Research in Education (IJERE)"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2264160432", "name": "Roziyan Adi Wicaksana"}, {"authorId": "2105514356", "name": "Shofiyatul Hasanah"}, {"authorId": "2105515211", "name": "Parahita Pradipta"}, {"authorId": "77949466", "name": "Erfan Efendi"}], "citations": []}
