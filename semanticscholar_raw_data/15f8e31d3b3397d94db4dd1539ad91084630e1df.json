Smart City's mission launched in the year 2015 to make cities smarter it ultimately makes India smarter and reliable. Infrastructure when adopts advance technologies enlighten the way of living, in this context, we designed a vision for smart roads. Though India is developing at full pace, the graph of road accidents per year due to bad road conditions has a very positive slope from the past two decades. The number of accidents due to potholes increased in the past few years, Integrating advanced technologies to the current road's infrastructure helps us to cut the number of accidents. Artificial Intelligent, Internet of Things, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Cloud, Fog and Edge computing technologies help to design an accident prevention system further improves the safety and security of citizens.", "venue": "International Conference on Communication Systems and Networks", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2020-01-01", "journal": {"name": "2020 International Conference on COMmunication Systems & NETworkS (COMSNETS)", "pages": "773-778"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1557620421", "name": "S.
