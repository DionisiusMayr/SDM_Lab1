The project is part of a multi-method approach by Hub Matter in the Helmholtz Metadata Collaboration (HMC). \nIn a harvesting-approach, data published by Helmholtz researchers is found starting from literature metadata, harvested from the research centers. Data publications linked to that literature are identified using the SCHOLIX API. In a first approach to automated FAIR assessment, we adopted the F-UJI framework, as developed by the FAIRsFAIR consortium. \nThe information collected is presented in an interactive dashboard. It allows to explore in which repositories Helmholtz researchers make their data publicly available, to engage Helmholtz communities, and to identify gaps towards improving the FAIRness of Helmholtz data. \nThe dashboard is publicly available on https://fairdashboard.helmholtz-metadaten.de. The general approach as well as all program code are reusable by all research communities.", "venue": "CoRDI", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-09-07", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the Conference on Research Data Infrastructure"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2238655944", "name": "Gabriel Preu\u00df"}, {"authorId": "2238649021", "name": "Alexander Schmidt"}, {"authorId": "2238662409", "name": "Mojeeb Sedeqi"}, {"authorId": "2238649425", "name": "Vivien Serve"}, {"authorId": "1405225641", "name": "Oonagh Mannix"}, {"authorId": "2238656068", "name": "Markus Kubin"}], "citations": []}
