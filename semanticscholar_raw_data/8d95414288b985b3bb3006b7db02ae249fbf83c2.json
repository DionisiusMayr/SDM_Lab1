We prove a general theorem that guarantees, under some assumptions on $G$, to approximate $\\mathbb E[T_{w,v}]$ up to $o(1)$ terms. As a corollary, we derive explicit formulas for the stochastic block model with two communities and connectivity parameters $p$ and $q$, and show that the average hitting times, for fixed $v$ and as $w$ varies, concentrates around four possible values. The proof is purely probabilistic and uses a coupling argument.", "venue": "", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Mathematics"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2024-02-14", "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2284217689", "name": "Andrea Ottolini"}], "citations": []}
