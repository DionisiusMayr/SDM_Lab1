Here \u0111 denotes the average degree in the graph and \u03b5 is an arbitrarily small positive constant. Recall that b-matching is the natural and well-studied generalization of the matching problem where different vertices are allowed to have different numbers of incident edges in the matching.", "venue": "ACM Symposium on Parallelism in Algorithms and Architectures", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-07-11", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 34th ACM Symposium on Parallelism in Algorithms and Architectures"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1772752", "name": "M.
