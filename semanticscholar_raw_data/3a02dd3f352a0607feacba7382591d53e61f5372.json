In the case of doctor and patient, it needs super speed to share several issues and remedial information with each other is projected as a routing algorithm with the sensor and cloud without any intermediate router by using IBM blue mix cloud. Direct contact with the destination router is possible by keeping an intelligent agent as a connector to the cloud and the sensors. A special header can be added behind the packet for the connection of several clouds or sensor-based destinations with priority. This technique can be used in the hospital for the establishment of a secure tunnel between patient and doctor.", "venue": "2021 6th International Conference for Convergence in Technology (I2CT)", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2021-04-02", "journal": {"name": "2021 6th International Conference for Convergence in Technology (I2CT)", "pages": "1-5"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2091563681", "name": "B.
