Although the Internet of Things is still in its infancy, its effects have already made incredible strides as a tool that can be applied in all associated contexts. The alignment of a related field is not necessarily paved by architecture research. Lack of knowledge in all aspects of architecture is the present obstacle. Researchers must traverse the variety of Internet of Thingscentric approaches. Internet of Things focused designs to support developer demands and better understand the applicable tool, technology, and approach. Their designs either explicitly or implicitly encourage the creation and application of powerful Internet of Things ideas to meet contemporary problems to support industry and academia.", "venue": "2023 11th International Conference on Internet of Everything, Microwave Engineering, Communication and Networks (IEMECON)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-02-10", "journal": {"name": "2023 11th International Conference on Internet of Everything, Microwave Engineering, Communication and Networks (IEMECON)", "pages": "1-6"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2214247530", "name": "Pallab Maity"}, {"authorId": "2214270413", "name": "Kajari Sur"}, {"authorId": "2214245495", "name": "Indraneel Muhopadhyay"}], "citations": []}
