In serverless resource allocation is fully managed by the cloud provider and the developer can solely concentrate on application development. To take to bene\ufb01t of serverless infrastructure many organizations are migrating their work on serverless. A range of applications and domains including image, text, and speech processing have led to machine learning (ML) becoming a widely deployed technology across many IT industries. It is di\ufb03cult to implement ML algorithms work\ufb02ows on a serverless platform. There are clearly de\ufb01ned user interactions during various steps in ML work\ufb02ows, such as data preprocessing, data training, and data \ufb01ne-tuning. The user may execute this frequently and will require low latency and the provision of resources automatically. A serverless platform must be designed e\ufb03ciently to support a stateful application work\ufb02ow. There is a need for distributed shared memory layer to manage synchronization and \ufb01ne-grained coordination between intermediate shared data. The proposed architecture provides an e\ufb03cient work\ufb02ow for stateful application with low network latency and the ability to share the mutable object with \ufb01ne grained coordination and synchronization. I have deployed the architecture on Amazon Web Services lambda functions. I have also validated the architecture using micro-benchmarks like latency, throughput, and parallelism. Further to state the \ufb01ne-grained state management in ML application on serverless I have compared its performance with AWS Spark Clusters for k-means clustering algorithm using 30 GB of data generated using spark-pref. According to the results, it was found that the proposed architecture optimizes ML application\u2019s performance on serverless in terms of time.", "venue": "", "year": null, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2111007281", "name": "Ankita Singh"}, {"authorId": "2286658845", "name": "Sean Heeney"}], "citations": []}
