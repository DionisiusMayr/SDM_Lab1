Modern NAND flash memory chips use multi-level cells (MLC), which store two bits of data in each cell, to improve chip density. As MLC NAND flash memory scaled down to smaller manufacturing process technologies, manufacturers adopted a two-step programming method to improve reliability. In two-step programming, the two bits of a multi-level cell are programmed using two separate steps, in order to minimize the amount of cell-to-cell program interference induced on neighboring flash cells. \nIn this work, we demonstrate that two-step programming exposes new reliability and security vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art MLC NAND flash memory. We experimentally characterize contemporary 1X-nm (i.e., 15--19nm) flash memory chips, and find that a partially-programmed flash cell (i.e., a cell where the second programming step has not yet been performed) is much more vulnerable to cell-to-cell interference and read disturb than a fully-programmed cell. We show that it is possible to exploit these vulnerabilities on solid-state drives (SSDs) to alter the partially-programmed data, causing (potentially malicious) data corruption. Based on our observations, we propose several new mechanisms that eliminate or mitigate these vulnerabilities in partially-programmed cells, and at the same time increase flash memory lifetime by 16%.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2018-05-08", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/1805.03291"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1744259", "name": "Yu Cai"}, {"authorId": "33801185", "name": "Saugata Ghose"}, {"authorId": "1792917", "name": "Yixin Luo"}, {"authorId": "143682176", "name": "K.
