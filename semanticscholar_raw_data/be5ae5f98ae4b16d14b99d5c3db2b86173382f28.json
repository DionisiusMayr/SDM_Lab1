Graph sampling is a fundamental technology for large-scale graph analysis and learning. To accelerate graph sampling using GPUs, recently some solutions like NextDoor, C-SAW have been proposed. However, these solutions cannot handle large graphs efficiently because of the massive memory footprint and expensive transfer cost between CPU and GPU. In this work, we introduce a Chunk-wise Graph Compression format (CGC) to effectively reduce the graph size and save the graph transfer cost. Meanwhile, CGC supports fast visiting any single neighbor of a vertex and is friendly to the graph sampling task. Specifically, CGC first balances the graph compression ratio and decompression efficiency by dividing a neighbor vertex list into chunks. Then it applies a new compression strategy called linear estimation to compress each chunk and allows users to visit a single vertex in O(1) time complexity. Finally, based on the CGC, we develop a scalable GPU-based graph sampling framework GraSS, and evaluate the efficiency and scalability of GraSS on both real-world and synthetic graphs. The empirical results demonstrate that GraSS can support various graph sampling methods on large graphs with high efficiency when the state-of-the-art solutions are out-of-memory or exceed the time limit.", "venue": "International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-10-17", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 31st ACM International Conference on Information & Knowledge Management"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2087123822", "name": "Hongbo Yin"}, {"authorId": "2237813", "name": "Yingxia Shao"}, {"authorId": "1720763480", "name": "Xupeng Miao"}, {"authorId": "2154959806", "name": "Yawen Li"}, {"authorId": "2143385941", "name": "Bin Cui"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "08ce4bdb94f410bf0f536bc602be3d20655cec52", "title": "Beyond Homophily: Robust Graph Anomaly Detection via Neural Sparsification"}]}
