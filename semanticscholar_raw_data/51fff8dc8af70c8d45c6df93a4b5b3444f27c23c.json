While today several FL libraries are proposed to data scientists and users, most of these frameworks are not designed to find seamless application in medical use-cases, due to the specific challenges and requirements of working with medical data and hospital infrastructures. Moreover, governance, design principles, and security assumptions of these frameworks are generally not clearly illustrated, thus preventing the adoption in sensitive applications. Motivated by the current technological landscape of FL in healthcare, in this document we present Fed-BioMed: a research and development initiative aiming at translating federated learning (FL) into real-world medical research applications. We describe our design space, targeted users, domain constraints, and how these factors affect our current and future software architecture.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-04-24", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2304.12012"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "153719951", "name": "Francesco Cremonesi"}, {"authorId": "91057392", "name": "M.
