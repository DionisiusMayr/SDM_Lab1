Everyday people are exposed to different items\u2019 offering that infer their interest and anticipate decisions. The context information (such as location, goals, and entities around a context) plays a key role in the recommendation\u2019s accuracy. Extending contexts snapshots into contexts histories enables that information to be exploit. It is possible to identify context\u2019s sequences, similar contexts histories and even predict future contexts. In this work we present Vulcont, a recommender system based on a contexts history ontology. Vulcont merges the benefits of ontology reasoning with contexts histories in order to measure contexts history similarity, based on semantic and ontology\u2019s properties provided by context\u2019s domain. Vulcont considers synonymous and classes\u2019 relations to measure similarity. After that, a collaborative filtering approach identifies sequences\u2019 frequency to identify potential items for recommendation. We evaluated and discussed the Vulcont\u2019s recommendation in four scenarios in an offline experiment, which presents Vulcont\u2019s recommendation power, due the exploit of semantic value of contexts history.", "venue": "IET Software", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-07-11", "journal": {"name": "IET Softw.", "pages": "111-123", "volume": "16"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1822611", "name": "Ismael M.
