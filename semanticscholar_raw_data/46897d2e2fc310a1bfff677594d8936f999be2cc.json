We investigate the formalization, using the Coq proof assistant, of a procedure for constructing online monitors from specifications written in past-time metric temporal logic (MTL). We employ an algebraic quantitative semantics that encompasses the Boolean and robustness semantics of MTL and we interpret formulas over a discrete temporal domain. A potentially infinite-state variant of Mealy machines, a kind of string transducers, is used as a formal model of online monitors. The main result is that there is a compositional construction from formulas to monitors, so that each monitor computes (in an online fashion) the semantic values of the corresponding formula over the input stream. From our Coq formalization, we extract OCaml code for executable on-line monitors. We have compared the performance of our monitoring framework with Reelay, a state-of-the-art tool for monitoring temporal properties.", "venue": "", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "1380735890", "name": "A.
