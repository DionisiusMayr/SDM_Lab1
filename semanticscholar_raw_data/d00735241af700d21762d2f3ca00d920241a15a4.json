This phenomenon poses a substantial challenge to the reliability of LLMs in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we survey recent efforts on the detection, explanation, and mitigation of hallucination, with an emphasis on the unique challenges posed by LLMs. We present taxonomies of the LLM hallucination phenomena and evaluation benchmarks, analyze existing approaches aiming at mitigating LLM hallucination, and discuss potential directions for future research.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-09-03", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2309.01219"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1895977079", "name": "Yue Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2110450452", "name": "Yafu Li"}, {"authorId": "152496687", "name": "Leyang Cui"}, {"authorId": "1724421", "name": "Deng Cai"}, {"authorId": "2978364", "name": "Lemao Liu"}, {"authorId": "2156525869", "name": "Tingchen Fu"}, {"authorId": "14799547", "name": "Xinting Huang"}, {"authorId": "2065703096", "name": "Enbo Zhao"}, {"authorId": "2257439415", "name": "Yu Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2109404730", "name": "Yulong Chen"}, {"authorId": "1800190", "name": "Longyue Wang"}, {"authorId": "1755919", "name": "A.
