The effectiveness of spectral clustering stems from constructing a non-linear embedding based on creating a similarity graph and computing the spectral decomposition of the Laplacian matrix. However, spectral clustering methods fail to scale to large data sets because of high computational cost and memory usage. A popular approach for addressing these problems utilizes the Nystr\u00f6m method, an efficient sampling-based algorithm for computing low-rank approximations to large positive semi-definite matrices. This paper demonstrates how the previously popular approach of Nystr\u00f6m-based spectral clustering has severe limitations. Existing time-efficient methods ignore critical information by prematurely reducing the rank of the similarity matrix associated with sampled points. Also, current understanding is limited regarding how utilizing the Nystr\u00f6m approximation will affect the quality of spectral embedding approximations. To address the limitations, this work presents a principled spectral clustering algorithm that exploits spectral properties of the similarity matrix associated with sampled points to regulate accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. We provide theoretical results to reduce the current gap and present numerical experiments with real and synthetic data. Empirical results demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed method compared to existing spectral clustering techniques based on the Nystr\u00f6m method and other efficient methods. The overarching goal of this work is to provide an improved baseline for future research directions to accelerate spectral clustering.", "venue": "IEEE Open Journal of Signal Processing", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-06-25", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Open Journal of Signal Processing", "pages": "242-256", "volume": "1"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1398664414", "name": "F.
