In this context, the oneM2M provides promising technical specifications for an interoperable and secure IoT/M2M system. This paper focuses on the potential threats and their impact on oneM2M standard-based smart city deployments. Further, configurations for base-line security of the oneM2M open-source implementation, called eclipse OM2M, are presented. Recommendations are proposed based on actual on-ground tests conducted on OM2M-based smart city deployment of IIIT Hyderabad (IIIT -H) in India. The tests cover passive eavesdropping, performing replay attacks, brute force on credentials, denial of service, and analysis of access control policies.", "venue": "International Conference on Communication Systems and Networks", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-01-03", "journal": {"name": "2023 15th International Conference on COMmunication Systems & NETworkS (COMSNETS)", "pages": "808-813"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2003314750", "name": "Gangavarapu Vigneswara Ihita"}, {"authorId": "2209677575", "name": "Vybhav.
