Initially, we partition the set of mobile stations (MSs) into subsets according to their spatial compatibility. We explore di\ufb00erent clustering algorithms, comparing them in terms of computational complexity and capability to partition MSs properly. In the following, we schedule MSs from the di\ufb00erent subsets to build the SDMA group. Since we consider a scenario with a massive arrange of antenna elements and that operates on the mmWave scenario, we employ a hybrid beamforming scheme and analyze its behavior in terms of the total data rate. The analog and digital precoders exploit the channel informa- tion obtained from clustering and scheduling, respectively. The simulation results indicate that a proper partition of MSs into clusters can take advantage of the spatial compatibility e\ufb00ectively and reduce the multi-user (MU) interference. The hierarchical clustering (HC) enhances the total data rate 25% compared with the baseline approach, while the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) increases the total data rate 20% .", "venue": "Journal of Communication and Information Systems", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "Journal of Communication and Information Systems"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1752845480", "name": "Francisco Hugo"}, {"authorId": "2568229", "name": "T.
