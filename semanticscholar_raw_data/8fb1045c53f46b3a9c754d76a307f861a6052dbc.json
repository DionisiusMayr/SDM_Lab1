The linear regression analysis model was used to study the differences in the academic style level of college students of different grades and genders, the correlation analysis of various dimensions of academic style and ideological and political level was carried out, and the linear fit of ideological and political curriculum education and academic style was analyzed by MATLAB to infer the significance level of ideological and political education and academic style. The results show that the correlation coefficient between ideology and politics and the dimension of learning purpose is 0.053, P=0.003<0.05. The correlation coefficient between ideology and politics and learning attitude was 0.239, P=0.008<0.05. The correlation coefficient between ideology and politics and learning effect dimension was 0.682, P=0.018<0.05. The data presented shows that ideology and politics have a significant impact on the construction of academic style.", "venue": "Applied Mathematics and Nonlinear Sciences", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-12-05", "journal": {"name": "Applied Mathematics and Nonlinear Sciences", "volume": "0"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2272046823", "name": "Haijun Liu"}, {"authorId": "2271449326", "name": "Bingbing Tao"}], "citations": []}
