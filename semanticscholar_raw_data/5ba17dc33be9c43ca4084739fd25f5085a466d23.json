A recent trend is to unify different computation types as part of a single stream/batch application that combines latency-sensitive (\"stream\") and latency-tolerant (\"batch\") jobs. This sharing of state and logic across jobs simplifies application development. Examples include machine learning applications that perform batch training and low-latency inference, and data analytics applications that include batch data transformations and low-latency querying. Existing execution engines, however, were not designed for unified stream/batch applications. As we show, they fail to schedule and execute them efficiently while respecting their diverse requirements. We present Neptune, an execution framework for stream/batch applications that dynamically prioritizes tasks to achieve low latency for stream jobs. Neptune employs coroutines as a lightweight mechanism for suspending tasks without losing task progress. It couples this fine-grained control over CPU resources with a locality-and memory-aware (LMA) scheduling policy to determine which tasks to suspend and when, thereby sharing executors among heterogeneous jobs. We evaluate our open-source Spark-based implementation of Neptune on a 75-node Azure cluster. Neptune achieves up to 3x lower end-to-end processing latencies for latency-sensitive jobs of a stream/batch application, while minimally impacting the throughput of batch jobs.", "venue": "ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book"], "publicationDate": "2019-11-20", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1725039", "name": "Panagiotis Garefalakis"}, {"authorId": "2687553", "name": "Konstantinos Karanasos"}, {"authorId": "1809586", "name": "P.
