Improving the top-level design and establishing a comprehensive monitoring and early warning system for natural disasters are keys to comprehensive disaster prevention and mitigation. This paper analyzed the needs of natural disaster monitoring and early warning business and system construction, focusing on the characteristics of integration, accuracy, speed, and efficiency and relying on the integrated perception and communication network of aviation, aerospace, ground, human, and network, and proposed a natural disaster comprehensive monitoring and early warning system framework that integrates business and technology. This can provide basic research support for the realization of cross-regional, cross-level, cross-system natural disaster monitoring and real-time forecast and early warning, and the construction of major disaster risk prevention and control projects in China.", "venue": "2021 IEEE 12th International Conference on Software Engineering and Service Science (ICSESS)", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2021-08-20", "journal": {"name": "2021 IEEE 12th International Conference on Software Engineering and Service Science (ICSESS)", "pages": "162-165"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2144329961", "name": "Wen Wang"}, {"authorId": "2116764812", "name": "Zhi Zhang"}, {"authorId": "41154933", "name": "Tao Wang"}, {"authorId": "2152822521", "name": "Yan Zhang"}, {"authorId": "1853090506", "name": "Wenhao Xu"}], "citations": []}
