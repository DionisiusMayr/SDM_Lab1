Big data technology can comprehensively analyze the teaching situation of students through massive data, and then provide the best solution, the current big data technology already has a strong technical foundation, which can provide assistance for students\u2019 teaching. The Internet of Things technology can collect personal information of students through sensors and miniature portable devices, and provide the data to the background server for big data analysis. In order to analyze the current status of the informationization of teaching management for college students, this paper first surveys some colleges and institutions through questionnaire surveys, and conducts data analysis on the collected questionnaires, and puts forward a solution based on big data and the Internet of Things based on the data analysis results. Finally, the combination of big data and Internet of Things technology for student teaching data collection, effect evaluation scheme, intelligent arrangement of integrated courses, intelligent recommendation scheme for students\u2019 teaching needs, and teaching management information visualization scheme are analyzed, and it is found that the combination of big data and Internet of Things related technologies It can effectively improve the efficiency of teaching management of college students.", "venue": "J.
