Our study examines the characteristics and operational aspects of chaos oscillators, prioritizing low-power functionality, resilient chaotic oscillations, and resistance to parameter variations and noise. This study emphasizes the key role of chaos oscillators in enhancing IoT security, showcasing their potential to ensure data integrity. The findings elucidate the dynamics and synchronization stability of the selected oscillators, providing insights into their suitability for secure communication systems. This comprehensive analysis contributes to advancing secure communication methodologies for the expanding landscape of wireless sensor networks in the Internet of Things, underscoring the significance of chaos oscillators in ensuring robust and secure data transmission.", "venue": "Applied Sciences", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-01-31", "journal": {"name": "Applied Sciences"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1491623191", "name": "Darja Cirjulina"}, {"authorId": "1491622264", "name": "Ruslans Babajans"}, {"authorId": "1410823712", "name": "F.
