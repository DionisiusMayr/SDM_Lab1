The computation offloading decision is made by comparing the average total costs due to the local and remote computation task executions at the vehicle and the MEC servers, respectively. Toward this end, we propose an analytical model to determine the average total cost due to remote task execution. We evaluate the performance of the proposed design by comparing its achievable cost with that due to an average mobility-based approximation. Simulation results show a cost reduction of up to 17% compared to the baseline.", "venue": "IEEE Communications Letters", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-02-01", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Communications Letters", "pages": "466-469", "volume": "24"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1500416677", "name": "Vu Huy Hoang"}, {"authorId": "2227233", "name": "T.
