To enable applications on mobile devices, the offloading approach processes live video streams using DNNs on server-class GPU accelerators. However, their use in latency constrained applications is particularly challenging because of the large and unpredictable round-trip latency from mobile devices to the cloud computing resources. As a consequence, system designers routinely look for ways to offload to local servers at the cloud edge, known as the cloudlet. This paper explores the potential of serving multiple DNNs using the cloudlet model to implement complex vision applications on mobile devices. We present DeepQuery, a new mobile offloading system that is capable to serve DNNs with different structures for a wide range of tasks including object detection and tracking, scene graph detection, and video description. DeepQuery provides application programming interfaces to offload applications programed as Directed Acyclic Graphs of DNN queries, and employs data parallelization and input batching techniques to reduce processing delays. To improve GPU utilization, it co-locates real-time and delay-tolerant tasks on shared GPUs, and exploits a predictive and plan-ahead approach to alleviate resource contention caused by co-locating. We evaluate DeepQuery and demonstrate its effectiveness using several real world applications.", "venue": "ACM SIGMM Conference on Multimedia Systems", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2019-06-18", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 10th ACM Multimedia Systems Conference"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2072873543", "name": "Zhou Fang"}, {"authorId": "2505157", "name": "Dezhi Hong"}, {"authorId": "2118189262", "name": "Rajesh K.
