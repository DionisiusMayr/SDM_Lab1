Such applications are considered a new class of data-intensive applications that generate massive irregular computation workloads and memory accesses, which degrade the performance significantly. Leveraging emerging hardware, such as process-in-memory (PIM) technology, could potentially accelerate such applications. In this paper, we propose PIMMiner, a high-performance PIM architecture graph mining framework. We first identify that current PIM architecture cannot be fully utilized by graph mining applications. Next, we propose a set of optimizations and interfaces that enhance the locality, and internal bandwidth utilization and reduce remote bank accesses and load imbalance through cohesive algorithm and architecture co-designs. We compare PIMMiner with several state-of-the-art graph mining frameworks and show that PIMMiner is able to outperform all of them significantly.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-06-17", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2306.10257"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1861728707", "name": "Jiya Su"}, {"authorId": "2061281673", "name": "Peng Jiang"}, {"authorId": "2873256", "name": "Rujia Wang"}], "citations": []}
