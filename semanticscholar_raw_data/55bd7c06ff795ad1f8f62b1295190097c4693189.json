Effective cardiac treatment requires an accurate heart disease prognosis. Therefore, this paper proposes a new heart disease classification model based on the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm for improved heart disease detection. To increase prediction accuracy, the \u03c72 statistical optimum feature selection technique was used. The suggested model\u2019s performance was then validated by comparing it to traditional models using several performance measures. The proposed model increased accuracy from 85.29% to 89.7%. Additionally, the componential load was reduced by half. This result indicates that our system outperformed other state-of-the-art methods in predicting heart disease.", "venue": "Designs", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-09-29", "journal": {"name": "Designs"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2186574914", "name": "Raniya R.
