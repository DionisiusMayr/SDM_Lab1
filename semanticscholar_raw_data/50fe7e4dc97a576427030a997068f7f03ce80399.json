With their recent usage in landslide susceptibility mapping, deep learning (DL) architectures have proven their efficiency in many scientific studies. However, some restrictions, including insufficient model variance and limited generalization capabilities, have been reported in the literature. To overcome these restrictions, ensembling DL models has often been preferred as a practical solution. In this study, an ensemble DL architecture, based on shared blocks, was proposed to improve the prediction capability of individual DL models. For this purpose, three DL models, namely Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), together with their ensemble form (CNN\u2013RNN\u2013LSTM) were utilized to model landslide susceptibility in Trabzon province, Turkey. The proposed DL architecture produced the highest modeling performance of 0.93, followed by CNN (0.92), RNN (0.91), and LSTM (0.86). Findings proved that the proposed model excelled the performance of the DL models by up to 7% in terms of overall accuracy, which was also confirmed by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The area under curve analysis also showed a significant improvement (~4%) in susceptibility map accuracy by the proposed strategy.", "venue": "Remote Sensing", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-11-25", "journal": {"name": "Remote.
