Code that is easy to read can save time, while hard-to-read code can lead to the introduction of bugs. However, it is difficult to establish what makes code more understandable. Although there are guides and directives on improving code understandability, in some contexts, these practices can have a detrimental effect. Practical software development projects often employ code review to improve code quality, including understandability. Reviewers are often senior developers who have contributed extensively to projects and have an in-depth understanding of the impacts of different solutions on code understandability. This paper is an early research proposal to recommend code understandability improvements based on code reviewer knowledge. The core of the proposal comprises a dataset of code understandability improvements extracted from code reviews. This dataset will serve as a basis to train machine learning systems to recommend understandability improvements.", "venue": "2021 36th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering Workshops (ASEW)", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2021-10-02", "journal": {"name": "2021 36th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering Workshops (ASEW)", "pages": "131-132"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2066670938", "name": "Delano Oliveira"}], "citations": []}
