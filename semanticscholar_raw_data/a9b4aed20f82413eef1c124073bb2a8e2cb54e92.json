It has much more complex requirements for processing and maintenance and thus it should be dealt using high-end servers. So, in turn, it has a lot more energy requirements. High energy requirements can lead to more energy wastage which is not a sustainable practice. In this paper, the comparison is done between 3 platforms that provide the framework for big data management. The platforms are Hive, Impala, and Spark. Many other platforms are also available but these three have been chosen because they can be easily implemented on even a single node Hadoop cluster. The results have shown that Cloudera Impala outperforms both the other platforms as it takes approximately 90% lesser time to do the same task.", "venue": "2017 IEEE International Conference on Power, Control, Signals and Instrumentation Engineering (ICPCSI)", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2017-09-01", "journal": {"name": "2017 IEEE International Conference on Power, Control, Signals and Instrumentation Engineering (ICPCSI)", "pages": "2896-2900"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2070827607", "name": "Upasna Sharma"}, {"authorId": "1863031", "name": "Sachin Bagga"}, {"authorId": "70067111", "name": "A.
