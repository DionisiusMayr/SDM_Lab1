Digitization techniques of Chinese Characters introduce attractive experiences of Chinese Character culture. The Chinese Character digitization generates large-scale data that is hard handled by traditional methods. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose Chinese Character Culture Big Data Platform that is designed based on the three-level hierarchy of cloud computing. The platform is built by means of open source technologies, for example, Hadoop ecosystem. The platform can effectively store, manage, and analyze large-scale data of digitized Chinese Character for supporting the Chinese Character culture experience application systems. This paper presents design concepts and architecture of the platform, as well as an experiment.", "venue": "International Conference on Cloud Computing and Big Data", "year": 2015, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2015-11-04", "journal": {"name": "2015 International Conference on Cloud Computing and Big Data (CCBD)", "pages": "161-168"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "8273966", "name": "Guigang Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2152765316", "name": "Jian Wang"}, {"authorId": "2112165134", "name": "Weixing Huang"}, {"authorId": "2143684405", "name": "Yi Yang"}, {"authorId": "2559809", "name": "Haixia Su"}, {"authorId": "2105585316", "name": "Ye Yue"}, {"authorId": "2072522837", "name": "Yichen Zhai"}, {"authorId": "10830439", "name": "Manxian Liu"}, {"authorId": "2108566444", "name": "Lijuan Chen"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "70296a7342d28dff28a7e0566061aa05607a1567", "title": "Technologies for the Preservation of Cultural Heritage\u2014A Systematic Review of the Literature"}, {"paperId": "447acab89d05ef035b0a98c79eaf157747da2f93", "title": "Optimized integration of traditional folk culture based on DSOM-FCM"}]}
