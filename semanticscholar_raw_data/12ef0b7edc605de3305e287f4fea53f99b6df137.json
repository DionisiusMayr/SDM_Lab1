Three-dimensional (3D) terrestrial laser scanning technology is widely used in the field of deformation monitoring due to its fast, complete, and high-density 3D data acquisition capabilities. However, 3D point clouds are characterized by rough surfaces, discrete distributions, which affect the accuracy of deformation analysis of two states data. In addition, it is impossible to directly extract the correspondence points from an irregularly distributed point cloud to unify the coordinates of the two states\u2019 data, and the correspondence lines and planes are often difficult to obtain in the natural environment. To solve the above problems, this paper studies a displacement change detection method for arch dams based on two-step point cloud registration and contour model comparison method. In the environment around a dam, the stable rock is used as the correspondence element to improve the registration accuracy, and a two-step registration method from rough to fine using the iterative closest point algorithm is present to describe the coordinate unification of the two states\u2019 data without control network and target. Then, to analyze the displacement variation of an arch dam surface in two states and improve the accuracy of comparing the two surfaces without being affected by the roughness of the point cloud, the contour model fitting the point clouds is used to compare the change in distance between models. Finally, the method of this paper is applied to the Xiahuikeng Arch Dam, and the displacement changes of the entire dam in different periods are visualized by comparing with the existing methods. The results show that the displacement change in the middle area of the dam is generally greater than that of the two banks, increasing with the increase in elevation, which is consistent with the displacement change behavior of the arch dam during operation and can reach millimeter-level accuracy.", "venue": "ISPRS Int.
