Machine learning can be an effective way to personalise climate communications. In this paper we use machine learning to reanalyse findings from a recent study, showing that online advertisements increased some people's belief in climate change while resulting in decreased belief in others. In particular, we show that the effect of the advertisements could change depending on people's age and ethnicity.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-09-10", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2109.05104"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "30426642", "name": "Totte Harinen"}, {"authorId": "39730594", "name": "Alex Filipowicz"}, {"authorId": "50203053", "name": "S.
