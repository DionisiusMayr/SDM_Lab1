A large number of fields and subjects, ranging from everyday life to traditional research fields (i.e., geography and transportation, biology and chemistry, medicine and rehabilitation), involve big data problems. The popularizing of various types of network has diversified types, issues, and solutions for big data more than ever before. In this paper, we review recent research in data types, storage models, privacy, data security, analysis methods, and applications related to network big data. Finally, we summarize the challenges and development of big data to predict current and future trends.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2017-02-27", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics", "pages": "1891-1899", "volume": "13"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1792647", "name": "Zhihan Lv"}, {"authorId": "29907659", "name": "Houbing Song"}, {"authorId": "1398856686", "name": "P.
