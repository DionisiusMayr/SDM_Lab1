It is designed to help researchers and practitioners prototype, implement and evaluate plant or crop models at any scale, without the hassle of technical computer science details. The package defines a framework for declaring processes and implementing associated models for their simulation, with key features including but not limited to:", "venue": "Journal of Open Source Software", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-06-26", "journal": {"name": "J.
