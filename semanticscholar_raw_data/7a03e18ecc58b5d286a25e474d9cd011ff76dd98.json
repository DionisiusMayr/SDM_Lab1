The required data can be specified as environment- and disaster-related data relevant to the Sendai Framework and Rio Conventions. A case study was carried out in the district of Badulla, which has recorded the highest number of disaster events in Sri Lanka, in order to explore the gaps in data and information management, with the ultimate objective of ensuring a disaster-minimised district. The study revealed that there are shortcomings in data collection, data storage and data sharing, which are important for fulfilling the requirements of four pillars of disaster management, i.e., mitigation\u2013minimising the effects of disaster, preparedness\u2013planning on how to respond, response\u2013efforts to minimise hazards created by a disaster; and recovery\u2013returning the community to normal.", "venue": "Asian Journal of Management Studies", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2021-02-09", "journal": {"name": "Asian Journal of Management Studies"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "82919012", "name": "R.M.M.I.
