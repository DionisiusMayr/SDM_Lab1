Design/methodology/approach \u2013 First, the integration of Apache Hive, Cloudera Impala and BDAS Shark make the platform support SQL-like query. Next, users can access a single interface and select the best performance of big data warehouse platform automatically by the proposed optimizer. Finally, the distributed memory storage system Memcached incorporated into the distributed file system, Apache HDFS, is employed for fast caching query results. Therefore, if users query the same SQL command, the same result responds rapidly from the cache system instead of suffering the repeated searches in a big data warehouse and taking a longer time to retrieve. Findings \u2013 As a result the proposed approach significantly improves the overall performance and dramatically reduces the search time as querying a database...", "venue": "", "year": 2016, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2016-07-11", "journal": {"name": "Engineering Computations", "pages": "1680-1704", "volume": "33"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1711452", "name": "B.
