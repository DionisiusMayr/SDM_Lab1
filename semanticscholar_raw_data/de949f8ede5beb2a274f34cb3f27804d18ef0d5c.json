Most of these have focused on answering the question, \u201cWhen will my bus arrive?\u201d; little has been done to answer the question, \u201cHow full will my next bus be?\u201d which also dramatically affects commuters\u2019 quality of life. In this article, we consider the bus fullness problem. In particular, we propose two different formulations of the problem, develop multiple predictive models, and evaluate their accuracy using data from the Pittsburgh region. Our predictive models consistently outperform the baselines (by up to 8 times).", "venue": "Trans.
