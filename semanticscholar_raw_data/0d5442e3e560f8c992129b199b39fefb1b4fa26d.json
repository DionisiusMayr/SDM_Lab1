Most state-of-the-art distributed stream processing engines focus on recovering individual operator failure. By analyzing the existing recovery techniques, we identify the challenges and propose a fault-tolerance framework that can tolerate both individual and correlated failures with minimum overhead during the system's normal execution. Our progressive and query-centric recovery paradigm carefully schedules the recovery of failed operators based on the current availability of resources, such that the outputs of queries can be recovered as early as possible. We also formulate the new problem of recovery scheduling under correlated failures and design algorithms to optimize the recovery latency with a performance guarantee.", "venue": "IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2018-04-01", "journal": {"name": "2018 IEEE 34th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE)", "pages": "1276-1279"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2069857320", "name": "Li Su"}, {"authorId": "1757091", "name": "Yongluan Zhou"}], "citations": []}
