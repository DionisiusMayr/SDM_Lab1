However, although data mining techniques used in security subjects such as intrusion detection, biometric authentication, fraud and malware classification, \u201cprivacy\u201d has become a serious problem, especially in data mining applications that involve the collection and sharing of personal data. For these reasons, the problem of protecting privacy in the context of data mining differs from traditional data privacy protection, as data mining can act as both a friend and foe. Chapter covers the previously developed privacy preserving data mining techniques in two parts: (i) techniques proposed for input data that will be subject to data mining and (ii) techniques suggested for processed data (output of the data mining algorithms). Also presents attacks against the privacy of data mining applications. The chapter conclude with a discussion of next-generation privacy-preserving data mining applications at both the individual and organizational levels.", "venue": "Artificial Intelligence", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2021-07-29", "journal": {"name": "Artificial Intelligence"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1577735628", "name": "Esma Erg\u00fcner \u00d6zko\u00e7"}], "citations": []}
