A number of social network analysis tasks have been developed to conduct on the real large-scale networks. However, the prohibitive cost of achieving the underlying large network, including time cost and data privacy, makes it hard to evaluate the performance of analysis algorithms on real-world social networks. In this paper, we present a tool called FastSNG, which generates heterogeneous social network datasets according to the user-defined configuration depicting the rich characteristics of the expected social network, such as community structures, attributes, and node degree distributions. Moreover, the generation algorithm of FastSNG adopts a degree distribution generation (D2G) model which is efficient to generate web-scale social network datasets. Finally, the tool provides user-friendly and succinct user interfaces for the interaction with general users.", "venue": "The Web Conference", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2021-04-19", "journal": {"name": "Companion Proceedings of the Web Conference 2021"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2112324478", "name": "Binbin Wang"}, {"authorId": "121900345", "name": "Chaokun Wang"}, {"authorId": "2087284346", "name": "Hao Feng"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "3df4a6393afe6ef7ade3a48c8d4b915b18796003", "title": "Benchmarking GNNs with GenCAT Workbench"}]}
