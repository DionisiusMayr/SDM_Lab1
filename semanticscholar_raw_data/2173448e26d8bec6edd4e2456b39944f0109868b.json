As more and more database applications move to the public cloud, we argue that it is time to make cost a first-class citizen when solving database optimization problems. In this paper, we introduce the concept of cost intelligence and envision the architecture of a cloud data warehouse designed for that. We investigate two critical challenges to achieving cost intelligence in an analytical system: automatic resource deployment and cost-oriented auto-tuning. We describe our system architecture with an emphasis on the components that are missing in today's cloud data warehouses. Each of these new components represents unique research opportunities in this much-needed research area.", "venue": "Conference on Innovative Data Systems Research", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-08-18", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2308.09569"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2043439", "name": "Huanchen Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2144471357", "name": "Yi-He Liu"}, {"authorId": "2112796787", "name": "Jiaqi Yan"}], "citations": []}
