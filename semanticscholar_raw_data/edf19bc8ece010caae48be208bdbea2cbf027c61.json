Research in neurosymbolic Arti\ufb01cial Intelligence (AI) approaches has surged recently: Symbolic and sub-symbolic methods are combined to solve complex tasks. Nevertheless the signi\ufb01cance of this \ufb01eld, little systematised knowledge exists yet. To scope our research, we will focus on semantic web machine learning systems (SWeMLS). Furthermore, AI systems have been under scrutiny due to prominent cases of biased or incorrect systems in sensitive domains. Thus, arises the need to make hybrid systems auditable, supporting the examination of their correct functioning. However, also this \ufb01eld has received limited attention. To that end, in this thesis, we want to investigate SWeMLS regarding 1) characteristics, interaction patterns and general system aspects, to provide an overview of this emerging \ufb01eld 2) guiding methodologies, technologies to make them auditable and 3) evaluation purposes by designing a generic end-to-end framework.", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "121743062", "name": "Laura Waltersdorfer"}], "citations": []}
