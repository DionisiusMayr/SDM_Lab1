We introduce a novel approach to modeling a customer's expected demand by incorporating feature-based price elasticity, which can be equivalently represented as a valuation with heteroscedastic noise. To solve the problem, we propose a computationally efficient algorithm called\"Pricing with Perturbation (PwP)\", which enjoys an $O(\\sqrt{dT\\log T})$ regret while allowing arbitrary adversarial input context sequences. We also prove a matching lower bound at $\\Omega(\\sqrt{dT})$ to show the optimality regarding $d$ and $T$ (up to $\\log T$ factors). Our results shed light on the relationship between contextual elasticity and heteroscedastic valuation, providing insights for effective and practical pricing strategies.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Economics", "Mathematics"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-12-26", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2312.15999"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2275040368", "name": "Jianyu Xu"}, {"authorId": "2276455067", "name": "Yu-Xiang Wang"}], "citations": []}
