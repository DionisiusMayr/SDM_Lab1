During conceptualization, OLAP algorithms are taken into account as applied to the selection of long-term meteodata and their mathematical processing presented by multidimensional hypercubes. When designing the SQL structure, a layered architecture of geographic information system (GIS) is used, including attribute and geographical characters. The data according to the technology is tested in the Jewish Autonomous Region. The database contains metrological information from five weather stations from 1960 to 2020 and five branches of local forest districts from 1997 to 2020. At present, data is being filled in for the Omsk Region, Primorsky Krai of the Russian Federation and the Osh Region of the Kyrgyz Republic.", "venue": "Journal of Physics: Conference Series", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Physics"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "Journal of Physics: Conference Series", "volume": "1889"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "102989628", "name": "V.
