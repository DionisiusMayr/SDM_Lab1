We detail the differentially private algorithms and other privacy safeguards used to provide results that can be used with existing real-time data analytics platforms, specifically with the open sourced Pinot system. Our privacy system provides user-level privacy guarantees. As part of our privacy system, we include a budget management service that enforces a strict differential privacy budget on the returned results to the analyst. This budget management service brings together the latest research in differential privacy into a product to maintain utility given a fixed differential privacy budget.", "venue": "Journal of Privacy and Confidentiality", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-02-14", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2002.05839"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "40101350", "name": "Ryan M.
