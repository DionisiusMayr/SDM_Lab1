As a recent and important recommendation problem, in heterogeneous one-class collaborative filtering (HOCCF), each user may involve of two different types of implicit feedback, i.e., examinations and purchases. So far, privacy-preserving HOCCF has received relatively little attention. Existing federated recommendation works often overlook the fact that some privacy sensitive behaviors such as purchases should be collected to ensure the basic business imperatives in e-commerce for example. Hence, the user privacy constraints can and should be relaxed while deploying a recommendation system in real scenarios. In this paper, we study the federated multi-behavior recommendation problem under the assumption that purchase behaviors can be collected. Moreover, there are two additional challenges that need to be addressed when deploying federated recommendation. One is the low storage capacity for users\u2019 devices to store all the item vectors, and the other is the low computational power for users to participate in federated learning. To release the potential of privacy-preserving HOCCF, we propose a novel framework, named discrete federated multi-behavior recommendation (DFMR), which allows the collection of the business necessary behaviors (i.e., purchases) by the server. As to reduce the storage overhead, we use discrete hashing techniques, which can compress the parameters down to 1.56% of the real-valued parameters. To further improve the computation-efficiency, we design a memorization strategy in the cache updating module to accelerate the training process. Extensive experiments on four public datasets show the superiority of our DFMR in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.", "venue": "ACM Transactions on Information Systems", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-03-18", "journal": {"name": "ACM Transactions on Information Systems"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2087684151", "name": "Enyue Yang"}, {"authorId": "2246016503", "name": "Weike Pan"}, {"authorId": "2278983135", "name": "Qiang Yang"}, {"authorId": "2106680008", "name": "Zhong Ming"}], "citations": []}
