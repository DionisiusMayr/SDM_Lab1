In India, Traditional cuisines consist of wide varieties due to locally available spices, herbs, vegetables, and fruits. In this paper, we purposed a method that recommends recipes of Indian cuisine on the basis of available ingredients and liked cuisine. For this work, we did web scraping to make a collection of recipes' varieties and after that apply the content-based approach of machine learning to recommend the recipes. This system gives the recommendation of Indian Cuisines based on ingredients.", "venue": "2019 IEEE 35th International Conference on Data Engineering Workshops (ICDEW)", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2019-04-08", "journal": {"name": "2019 IEEE 35th International Conference on Data Engineering Workshops (ICDEW)", "pages": "96-99"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "150247978", "name": "Nilesh Nilesh"}, {"authorId": "144308432", "name": "Madhu Kumari"}, {"authorId": "150260234", "name": "Pritom Hazarika"}, {"authorId": "150333653", "name": "Vishal Raman"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "7574f7c2e6c557937c6a562db73e677b43f799a0", "title": "A Hybrid Recommendation System for Retail Marketing"}, {"paperId": "c278ec06cb9c64451665398855c74b12b25eb816", "title": "CGRS: Collaborative Knowledge Propagation Graph Attention Network for Recipes Recommendation"}, {"paperId": "607e04061b3a45568f4174a929f517c7e33bf5f7", "title": "Text-Based Recommendation System for E-Commerce Apparel Stores"}, {"paperId": "1600f5798d7117971875c9b1220b2e4e8ca5513c", "title": "Recipe Recommendation Based on Information Propagation of Knowledge Graphs"}, {"paperId": "65fcf40dc896e5efee78ec23813e6f209cdf2629", "title": "Design of Smart Attachment for Refrigerator"}, {"paperId": "b4054ab6d58cb4420b3b96c3d73f3d2db42ac61a", "title": "Solar Energy Prediction Model using machine learning and Internet of Things"}, {"paperId": "b1e3ca2a8abf3d52da7885af1f6246b4498bfa05", "title": "Knowledge distillation for multi-depth-model-fusion recommendation algorithm"}, {"paperId": "0eab34770810c6b001bd8aca8dc4b193331e23e8", "title": "ChefAI.IN: Generating Indian Recipes with AI Algorithm"}, {"paperId": "10f0f233aeb4ff60ca76a5daff2f5c1da5e8905e", "title": "Ingredient Substitute Recommendation Based on Collaborative Filtering and Recipe Context for Automatic Allergy-Safe Recipe Generation"}, {"paperId": "0269762b317f68cb7c186f9efdb082cc2e91c62d", "title": "A Cooking Recipe Multi-Label Classification Approach for Food Restriction Identification"}, {"paperId": "a05fd2410e78cf55117c86f21bd22ed6fa29c8ba", "title": "A Review: Recommendation System of Indian Cuisine Recipes Using Content-Based Approach"}, {"paperId": "c0d2e268135644e3ffd9c2190b5c2c7000d90d7c", "title": "Recipe Recommendation System Using TF-IDF"}, {"paperId": "3adc031abc215db36878ab9f84a22f2c6e3c566b", "title": "The Solo Chef: Recipe Recommending Web Application Using Machine Learning"}]}
