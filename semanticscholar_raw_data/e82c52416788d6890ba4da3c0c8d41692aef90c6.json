The spread of Covid-19 is a prime example of that. Supply chain managers are urged to rethink their competitive strategies to make use of Big Data Analytics (BDA), due to the increasing uncertainty in both demand and supply side, the competition among the supply chain partners and the need to identify ways to offer personalised products and services. With many supply chain executives recognising the need of \u2018improving with data\u2019, supply chain businesses need to equip themselves with sophisticated BDA methods/techniques to create valuable insights from big data, thus, enhancing the decision-making process and optimising the efficiency of Supply Chain Operations (SCO). This paper proposes the building blocks of a theoretical framework for understanding the impact of BDA on SCO. The framework is based on a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on BDA and SCO, underpinned by Task-Technology-Fit theory and Institutional Theory. The paper contributes to the literature by building a platform for future work on investigating factors driving and inhibiting BDA impact on SCO.", "venue": "Production Planning &amp; Control", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-05-16", "journal": {"name": "Production Planning & Control", "pages": "46 - 70", "volume": "35"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1657310729", "name": "Ruaa Hasan"}, {"authorId": "1772062", "name": "M.
