The revised version is Proposition 5 in this document. \u2022 Definition 1 in Appendix B.2, which defines dominance, has a revision in the condition for c-dominance. The revised version is Definition 1 in this document. We also offer new definitions of equivalence and weak equivalence. \u2022 The dominance pushdown rules in Appendix B.3 have, in general, been revised and substantially expanded. In particular, Proposition 7 in Quickr, which relates to projections that drop columns is simple but incomplete; Propositions 8 and 9 in this document consider the case of projections that rename columns and create new columns respectively. Proposition 8 in Quickr, which relates to pushing samplers past selections, is replaced with Proposition 10 in this document. Finally, we separate the Proposition 9 in Quickr, which pushes samplers past joins, into two separate propositions; Proposition 2 considers the special-case of foreign key joins and Proposition 12 considers other equijoins.", "venue": "", "year": 2016, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "1741860", "name": "Srikanth Kandula"}], "citations": []}
