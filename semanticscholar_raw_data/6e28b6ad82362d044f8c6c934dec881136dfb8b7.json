Especially, in this paper we introduce an efficient bandwidth allocation strategy called EBA-MAC to coordinate communication between servers within a single rack. The primary objective of EBA-MAC is to prevent data collisions and minimize latency for users of cloud applications. The proposed SD optical intra-rack DCN architecture accompanied by the suggested EBA-MAC protocol achieves a 95.5% optical bandwidth utilization and an average packet delay of few \u00b5s, meeting the strict delay requirements of modern cloud services. Compared to a SotA intra-rack DCN approach, it achieves an 8% higher throughput and 95% less mean packet delay for heavy loads. The stability of the proposed EBA-MAC protocol is also investigated under varying bursty traffic scenarios to explore its performance level for delay-sensitive applications.", "venue": "International Mediterranean Conference on Communications and Networking", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-09-04", "journal": {"name": "2023 IEEE International Mediterranean Conference on Communications and Networking (MeditCom)", "pages": "169-174"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2220780975", "name": "David Georgantas"}, {"authorId": "3259362", "name": "P.
