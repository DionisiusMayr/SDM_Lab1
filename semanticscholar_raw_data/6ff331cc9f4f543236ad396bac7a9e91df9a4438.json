Services and systems powered by the IoT enable smart airports to have enhanced robustness, ef\ufb01ciency and control, governed by real-time monitoring and analytics. Smart sensors control the environmental conditions inside the airport, automate passenger-related actions and support airport security. However, these augmentations and automation introduce security threats to network systems of smart airports. Cyber-attackers demonstrated the susceptibility of IoT systems and networks to Advanced Persistent Threats (APT), due to hardware constraints, software \ufb02aws or IoT miscon\ufb01gurations. With the increasing complexity of attacks, it is imperative to safeguard IoT networks of smart airports and ensure reliability of services, as cyber-attacks can have tremendous consequences such as disrupting networks, cancelling travel, or stealing sensitive information. There is a need to adopt and develop new Arti\ufb01cial Intelligence (AI)-enabled cyber-defence techniques for smart airports, which will address the challenges brought about by the incorporation of IoT systems to the airport business processes, and the constantly evolving nature of contemporary cyber-attacks. In this study, we present a holistic review of existing smart airport applications and services enabled by IoT sensors and systems. Additionally, we investigate several types of cyber defence tools including AI and data mining techniques, and analyse their strengths and weaknesses in the context of smart airports. Furthermore, we provide a classi\ufb01cation of smart airport sub-systems based on their purpose and criticality and address cyber threats that can affect the security of smart airport\u2019s networks.", "venue": "", "year": null, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "38986974", "name": "Nickolaos Koroniotis"}, {"authorId": "3193106", "name": "Nour Moustafa"}, {"authorId": "2232845527", "name": "Ieee Francesco Ferranti Senior Member"}, {"authorId": "1680674", "name": "Praveen Gauravaram"}, {"authorId": "2260340101", "name": "Helge Janicke"}, {"authorId": "38986974", "name": "Nickolaos Koroniotis"}], "citations": []}
