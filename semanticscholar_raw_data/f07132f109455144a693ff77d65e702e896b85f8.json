To study the effects of implementation parallel scientific applications, we deployed. Despite the fact that they did not show better performance than the same algorithm implemented in MPI, we conducted experiments to solve problems iterative computations using the Hadoop architecture. As a result of the experiments, the fail-safe behavior of Hadoop technology was revealed in the solutions of complex hadacies.", "venue": "2017 IEEE 14th International Scientific Conference on Informatics", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2017-11-01", "journal": {"name": "2017 IEEE 14th International Scientific Conference on Informatics", "pages": "164-167"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "9098144", "name": "M.
