Conventionally, users of the same type are assigned the same demand pattern, which does not reflect the variability in demand patterns. In Hefei City, a lot of remote smart demand meters were installed in recent years, providing real-time water consumption data for different water user sites. In this study, the water consumption data based on 10 min accuracy were collected and used in the established EPANET model of the study area. A 48 h simulation, including workdays and weekends, was carried out, and each node\u2019s base demand and demand pattern were accurately calculated according to the remote data. The results show that the accuracy of the model has met the modeling criteria (less than 2 m for all pressure monitoring points), and there is no need to calibrate the nodal demand. The established offline hydraulic model can better reflect the water consumption characteristics of each type of user and has revealed the significant influence of secondary water supply systems.", "venue": "Water", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-06-16", "journal": {"name": "Water"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1729093103", "name": "Ruiping Song"}, {"authorId": "2158610453", "name": "Xinyue Liu"}, {"authorId": "2172115439", "name": "Bo Zhu"}, {"authorId": "2239810840", "name": "Shuai Guo"}], "citations": []}
