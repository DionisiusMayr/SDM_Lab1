This paper introduces ShuffleBench, a novel benchmark to evaluate the performance of modern stream processing frameworks. In contrast to other benchmarks, it focuses on use cases where stream processing frameworks are mainly employed for shuffling (i.e., re-distributing) data records to perform state-local aggregations, while the actual aggregation logic is considered as black-box software components. ShuffleBench is inspired by requirements for near real-time analytics of a large cloud observability platform and takes up benchmarking metrics and methods for latency, throughput, and scalability established in the performance engineering research community. Although inspired by a real-world observability use case, it is highly configurable to allow domain-independent evaluations. ShuffleBench comes as a ready-to-use open-source software utilizing existing Kubernetes tooling and providing implementations for four state-of-the-art frameworks. Therefore, we expect ShuffleBench to be a valuable contribution to both industrial practitioners building stream processing applications and researchers working on new stream processing approaches. We complement this paper with an experimental performance evaluation that employs ShuffleBench with various configurations on Flink, Hazelcast, Kafka Streams, and Spark in a cloud-native environment. Our results show that Flink achieves the highest throughput while Hazelcast processes data streams with the lowest latency.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-03-07", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2403.04570"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2277535340", "name": "S\u00f6ren Henning"}, {"authorId": "2277535913", "name": "Adriano Vogel"}, {"authorId": "2290181619", "name": "Michael Leichtfried"}, {"authorId": "48104573", "name": "Otmar Ertl"}, {"authorId": "2277533356", "name": "Rick Rabiser"}], "citations": []}
