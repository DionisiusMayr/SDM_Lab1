Apart from exciting network innovations, in-network computing has been explored as a means to accelerate a variety of distributed systems concerns, by leveraging programmable network devices. In this paper, we extend in-network computing to an important class of applications called deep neural network (DNN) serving. In particular, we propose to run DNN inferences in the network data plane in a distributed fashion and make our programmable network a powerful accelerator for DNN serving. We demonstrate the feasibility of this idea through a case study with a real-world DNN on a typical data center network architecture.", "venue": "EuroP4@CoNEXT", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-12-06", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 5th International Workshop on P4 in Europe"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2034016831", "name": "Kamran Razavi"}, {"authorId": "2139374426", "name": "George Karlos"}, {"authorId": "10377685", "name": "Vinod Nigade"}, {"authorId": "1725964", "name": "M.
