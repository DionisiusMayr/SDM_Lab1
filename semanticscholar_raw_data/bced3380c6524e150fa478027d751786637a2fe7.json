However, new privacy concerns have also emerged during the aggregation of the distributed intermediate results. The emerging privacy-preserving FL (PPFL) has been heralded as a solution to generic privacy-preserving machine learning. However, the challenge of protecting data privacy while maintaining the data utility through machine learning still remains. In this article, we present a comprehensive and systematic survey on the PPFL based on our proposed 5W-scenario-based taxonomy. We analyze the privacy leakage risks in the FL from five aspects, summarize existing methods, and identify future research directions.", "venue": "ACM Computing Surveys", "year": 2021,
