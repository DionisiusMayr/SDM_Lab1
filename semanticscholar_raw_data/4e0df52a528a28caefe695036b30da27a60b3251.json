The constraints specified in the official regulations for the Shell Eco-Marathon prototype battery electric class could ostensibly limit design innovations. However, this paper introduces a methodological approach employing Machine Learning, facilitated by Large Language Models, which substantially broadens the spectrum of conceptual design possibilities. Further, the widely recognized technique of Computer-Aided Design, coupled with Generative Design, is leveraged to optimize specific sections of the chassis structure. The final stage of this study involves rigorous testing of the designed chassis to assess its mechanical performance, guided by the stringent benchmarks set by the competition.", "venue": "2023 International Symposium on Electromobility (ISEM)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-10-26", "journal": {"name": "2023 International Symposium on Electromobility (ISEM)", "pages": "1-8"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "147051970", "name": "Javier A. de la Tejera"}, {"authorId": "2270199777", "name": "Ricardo A.
