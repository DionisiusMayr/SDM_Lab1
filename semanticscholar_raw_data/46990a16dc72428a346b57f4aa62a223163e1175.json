In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for efficient resource allocation in Software-Defined Networks (SDNs) to meet the unique requirements of IoT applications. Our approach leverages the flexibility and programmability of SDN to dynamically allocate network resources based on the specific needs of IoT devices. Our proposal combines reinforcement learning with dynamic resource allocation, demonstrating its effectiveness in optimizing resource allocation and enhancing network performance. The results highlight the potential of our approach to addressing the resource challenges in SDN-based IoT environments. The proposed method obtains results superior to 30% of throughput in comparison to a traditional resource allocation in SDN to IoT applications.", "venue": "International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-09-21", "journal": {"name": "2023 International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks (SoftCOM)", "pages": "1-5"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2257321328", "name": "Alexandre Ladeira de Sousa"}, {"authorId": "2129313657", "name": "O.
