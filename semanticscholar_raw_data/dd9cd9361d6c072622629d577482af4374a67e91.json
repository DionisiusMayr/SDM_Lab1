These calculations are carried out on the largest supercomputers worldwide with data in the multi-PetaByte range being generated and analyzed. In the Lattice QCD community, a custom metadata standard (QCDml) that includes certain provenance information already exists for one part of the workflow, the so-called generation of configurations. In this paper, we follow the W3C PROV standard and formulate a provenance model that includes both the generation part and the so-called measurement part of the Lattice QCD workflow. We demonstrate the applicability of this model and show how the model can be used to answer some provenance-related research questions. However, many important provenance questions in the Lattice QCD community require extensions of this provenance model. To this end, we propose a multi-layered provenance approach that combines prospective and retrospective elements.", "venue": "The Web Conference", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Physics"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-03-22", "journal": {"name": "Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "17855344", "name": "Tanja Auge"}, {"authorId": "2494152", "name": "G.
