An initial screening of 300 papers was carried out, which underwent a criteria's selection aiming to identify the papers that deal with the application of open data and linked data in any domain of smart cities or that carry out a more theoretical evaluation of the subject matter involving end-users in smart cities. As a result, it was noticed that the semantic web studies are still concerned with technical issues, but that there are already researchers concerned with Computer-Human Interaction perspectives for data access that profiles of citizens present in smart cities. Based on this, a profile's taxonomy was developed to assist the development of platforms focused on citizens, which can help in features' identification and knowledge mapping for each profile.", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "1382169004", "name": "Mateus G.
