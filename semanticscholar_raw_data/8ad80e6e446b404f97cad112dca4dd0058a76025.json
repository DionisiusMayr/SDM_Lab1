In this second step we have created the Occopus descriptors of a Spark environment that is combined with Hadoop HDFS, scalable and deployable in major cloud systems like Amazon, OpenStack, OpenNebula, CloudSigma, etc. The deployment of such a Spark environment is automatic and hence facilitates the usage of Spark technology in clouds. The Spark environment was successfully used by the Institute for Political Science of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences to the classi\ufb01cation of newspaper articles.", "venue": "", "year": null, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2263236319", "name": "E.
