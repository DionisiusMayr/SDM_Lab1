Algorithms play a vital role in data processing and analytics where many algorithm designs have incorporated heuristics and general rules from human knowledge and experience to improve their effectiveness. Recently, reinforcement learning, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in particular, is increasingly explored and exploited in many areas because it can learn better strategies in complicated environments it is interacting with than statically designed algorithms. Motivated by this trend, we provide a comprehensive review of recent works focusing on utilizing DRL to improve data processing and analytics. First, we present an introduction to key concepts, theories, and methods in DRL. Next, we discuss DRL deployment on database systems, facilitating data processing and analytics in various aspects, including data organization, scheduling, tuning, and indexing. Then, we survey the application of DRL in data processing and analytics, ranging from data preparation, natural language processing to healthcare, fintech, etc. Finally, we discuss important open challenges and future research directions of using DRL in data processing and analytics.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2021-08-10", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering", "pages": "4446-4465", "volume": "35"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "144994208", "name": "Qingpeng Cai"}, {"authorId": "46212918", "name": "Can Cui"}, {"authorId": "2214393", "name": "Yiyuan Xiong"}, {"authorId": "47825100", "name": "Wei Wang"}, {"authorId": "3063356", "name": "Zhongle Xie"}, {"authorId": "1793178", "name": "Meihui Zhang"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "9d95caf3fc89b326ba8504482a96e9509035a158", "title": "Designing an optimal microgrid control system using deep reinforcement learning: A systematic review"}, {"paperId": "d4a845732520c1b9564f2553974be754ec109857", "title": "Teleconsultation dynamic scheduling with a deep reinforcement learning approach."}, {"paperId": "73f474878cfd8317b5e98bc0952ba8a169a5abfa", "title": "Systematic Review on Reinforcement Learning in the Field of Fintech"}, {"paperId": "c81e78fbbacd77244f69a9b30db1b7a89dfb35a4", "title": "Deep Reinforcement Learning for Mineral Prospectivity Mapping"}, {"paperId": "5d4ddf239b7a887088e7b72808a8e87d0de272d7", "title": "Robot path planning using deep reinforcement learning"}, {"paperId": "d1afea7af0168397189a39a3f351a2ba359ccdca", "title": "Software-Based Mass Customization of Artificial Neural Networks and its Benefits"}, {"paperId": "e43272b6d0cf8c6bb5931c226dc5dd47cf88b0df", "title": "The Metaverse Data Deluge: What Can We Do About It?"}, {"paperId": "c558922adfe3526951ac73ecbc0fc22a6d5ba6e9", "title": "NOMA resource allocation method in IoV based on prioritized DQN-DDPG network"}, {"paperId": "9602241f2e0fcc43e1d99e17c4bb4404eca8780b", "title": "Sense The Physical, Walkthrough The Virtual, Manage The Metaverse: A Data-centric Perspective"}]}
