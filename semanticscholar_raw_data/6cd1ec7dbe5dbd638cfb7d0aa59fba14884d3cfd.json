Although the topic of IoT security (and previously the security of wireless sensor networks) has been reviewed extensively, we believe that the topic deserves a more in-depth examination towards a more systematic threat analysis, which is not only necessary to better understand the threats against IoT-based systems, but also paves the way to effectively improve the security of IoT-based systems by integrating with the blockchain technology. The major research contributions of this paper include a new taxonomy of the threats against IoT-based systems, identify what threats can be effectively mitigated by integrating IoT with with blockchain technology, the challenges faced by the blockchain-enabled IoT-based systems, and the likely approaches to overcoming these challenges.", "venue": "International Conferences on Smart Internet of Things", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2020-08-01", "journal": {"name": "2020 IEEE International Conference on Smart Internet of Things (SmartIoT)", "pages": "205-212"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "144101028", "name": "Wenbing Zhao"}, {"authorId": "47569322", "name": "Shunkun Yang"}, {"authorId": "144118283", "name": "Xiong Luo"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "274839ca1df854c19e5c4a547717a0801c531208", "title": "Improving Reliability for Detecting Anomalies in the MQTT Network by Applying Correlation Analysis for Feature Selection Using Machine Learning Techniques"}, {"paperId": "6f1b8c45c5db6bfff66454f1c921663cae3d34f4", "title": "The Professionalization of the Hacker Industry"}, {"paperId": "17cbe0b8b92e1c3b3f609092e72f8619baca100d", "title": "Dos and Don\u2019ts in Blockchain Research and Development"}, {"paperId": "7e4880a4e54609963be91367158ccdd290033afb", "title": "Internet-of-Things Security and Vulnerabilities: Case Study"}, {"paperId": "e5ef3536f12bc441d1f3c5c85590d6d3b5123d3d", "title": "Design and Implementation of a Blockchain-Enabled Secure Sensing Data Processing and Logging System"}, {"paperId": "755607e65510565e62f4092500216a7efbcf8bce", "title": "Smart home security: challenges, issues and solutions at different IoT layers"}, {"paperId": "eac16e7aa5b43cd3eb2ca9b0fe1ac9f699759a16", "title": "Blockchain-Enabled Cyber\u2013Physical Systems: A Review"}, {"paperId": "878d393c3da6a85519082416584d671b1135d110", "title": "A Blockchain-Facilitated Secure Sensing Data Processing and Logging System"}, {"paperId": "41b2812227a0332a03de5c058b69517b22d9d562", "title": "Blockchain Applications"}]}
