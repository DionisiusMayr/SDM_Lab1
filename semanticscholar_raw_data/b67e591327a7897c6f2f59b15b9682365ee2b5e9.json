The aim of this paper is to study a well-known anomaly detection technique on the \u201cShort Message Service Centre\u201d server, used in the telecommunications field to handle and store messages. This server was studied in details, a script was written to gather all the required data that went through a cleaning phase and a labeling process after being deeply analyzed. The decision tree algorithm was chosen to be implemented, and it originally gave a precision of 98.82%. After performing different types of tuning and optimization, the precision reached 99.38% with an effective accuracy of 99.98%. Our approach proved that the application on this type of servers is efficient and leads to very good results, which can also be improved in future studies.", "venue": "2017 8th International Conference on Information Technology (ICIT)", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2017-05-01", "journal": {"name": "2017 8th International Conference on Information Technology (ICIT)", "pages": "127-133"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "27051482", "name": "Georges Chaaya"}, {"authorId": "1719781", "name": "H.
