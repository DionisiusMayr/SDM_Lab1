The method is based on the Spark distributed cluster computing engine of Hadoop, which ensures the stability of massive DNS log data storage with high fault tolerance and 24-hour real-time processing. At the same time, the Spark distributed cluster uses the multi-thread parallel computing method combined with the improved AC automaton algorithm, which not only reduces the memory occupied by trie construction, but also improves the efficiency of rapid matching of CNAME records of massive DNS logs. Simulation results show that the proposed method can quickly match CNAME records of massive DNS log data. Compared with the original AC algorithm, the efficiency is significantly improved, and the time complexity and storage space are reduced.", "venue": "IEEE Access", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "IEEE Access", "pages": "32628-32635", "volume": "11"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2213523703", "name": "Guojian Xu"}, {"authorId": "48029609", "name": "Mingyang Song"}, {"authorId": "2212940099", "name": "Zhenggang Leng"}, {"authorId": "2072783136", "name": "Zhenghong Jia"}], "citations": []}
