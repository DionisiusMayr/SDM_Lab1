Despite ongoing advances in our understanding of UC, its pathogenesis is yet unelu-cidated, underscoring the urgent need for novel treatment strategies for patients with UC. Exosomes are nanoscale membrane particles that mediate intercellular communication by carrying various bioactive molecules, such as proteins, RNAs, DNA, and metabolites. The NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is a cytosolic tripartite protein complex whose activation induces the maturation and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 \u03b2 (IL-1 \u03b2 ) and IL-18, triggering the inflammatory response to a pathogenic agent or injury. Growing evidence suggests that exosomes are new modulators of the NLRP3 inflammasome, with vital roles in the pathological process of UC. Here, recent evidence is reviewed on the role of exosomes and NLRP3 inflammasome in UC. First, the dual role of exosomes on NLRP3 inflammasome and the effect of NLRP3 inflammasome on exosome secretion are summarized. Finally, an outlook on the directions of exosome-NLRP3 inflammasome crosstalk research in the context of UC is proposed and areas of further research on this topic are high-lighted.", "venue": "", "year": null, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2283144923", "name": "Xin Li"}, {"authorId": "2282608946", "name": "Li-Jiang Ji"}, {"authorId": "2282791131", "name": "Kai-Di Feng"}, {"authorId": "2282740318", "name": "Hua Huang"}, {"authorId": "2282843082", "name": "Mei-Rou Liang"}, {"authorId": "2282968455", "name": "Shi-Jin Cheng"}, {"authorId": "2283252182", "name": "Xiu-Dong Meng"}], "citations": []}
