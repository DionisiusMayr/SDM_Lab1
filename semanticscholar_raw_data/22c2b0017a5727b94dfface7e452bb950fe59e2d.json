WSNs are used together with IoT devices to monitor real environments. In this study, attacks against WSNs were carried out. The attack chosen for this study is a flood attack. In addition, solution suggestions for this attack are presented. In this context, firstly reference and attack packages have been collected, and then the collected packages have been compared with the reference packages and forensic investigations have been carried out. The result of the evaluation has shown the importance continuous monitoring on 24/7 basis and detecting abnormal behaviors in IoT traffic with forensics analysis for preventing attacks.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2020-10-29", "journal": {"name": "", "pages": "2366-2376", "volume": "8"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "151489674", "name": "G\u00f6k\u00e7e Karacay\u0131lmaz"}, {"authorId": "81545550", "name": "Serkan G\u00f6nen"}, {"authorId": "2854568", "name": "Harun Artuner"}, {"authorId": "2260044312", "name": "Ercan Nurcan"}, {"authorId": "2260034814", "name": "Yilmaz"}, {"authorId": "145676216", "name": "H.
