We answer the code comment classification shared task challenge by providing a two-fold evaluation: from an algorithmic perspective, we compare the performance of classical machine learning systems and complement our evaluations from a data-driven perspective by generating additional data with the help of large language model (LLM) prompting to measure the potential increase in performance. Our best model, which took second place in the shared task, is a Neural Network with a Macro-F1 score of 88.401% on the provided seed data and a 1.5% overall increase in performance on the data generated by the LLM.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-10-13", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2310.10275"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1514280691", "name": "Hanna Abi Akl"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "bb6fbcc3d89c0b064769278a2cbdd60aa44ac11a", "title": "NeSy is alive and well: A LLM-driven symbolic approach for better code comment data generation and classification"}]}
