In such conditions, a solution is needed to find out how to solve it. The development of multimedia learning for diesel engines is made to increase the acquisition of understanding and skills in diesel engines lessons. This research uses a qualitative method, collecting data in a questionnaire, and in-depth interviews with 36 students. The results of the research proved that multimedia diesel engines developed can increase the acquisition of learning outcomes. In addition to contributing to learning techniques, this study also found learning outcomes involving multi-sensor. It is better if the results of multimedia development can be developed to facilitate learning. This research is limited to the scope of multimedia diesel engines with PowerPoint computer programs.", "venue": "Proceedings of the 4th International Conference of Vocational Higher Education", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 4th International Conference of Vocational Higher Education"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2275981479", "name": "Barokah"}, {"authorId": "2275983822", "name": "Parabelem Tinno"}, {"authorId": "2275983869", "name": "Dolf Rompas"}, {"authorId": "2134887561", "name": "M.
