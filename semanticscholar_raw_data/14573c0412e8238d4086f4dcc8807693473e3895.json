We posit that generative artificial intelligence (AI) models designed for mental health counseling could help improve outcomes by lowering barriers to access. To this end, we have developed a deep learning (DL) dialogue system called Serena. The system consists of a core generative model and post-processing algorithms. The core generative model is a 2.7 billion parameter Seq2Seq Transformer [26] fine-tuned on thousands of transcripts of person-centered-therapy (PCT) sessions. The series of postprocessing algorithms detects contradictions, improves coherency, and removes repetitive answers. Serena is implemented and deployed on https://serena.chat, which currently offers limited free services. While the dialogue system is capable of responding in a qualitatively empathetic and engaging manner, occasionally it displays hallucination and long-term incoherence. Overall, we demonstrate that a deep learning mental health dialogue system has the potential to provide a low-cost and effective complement to traditional human counselors with less barriers to access.", "venue": "International Conference on Big Data and Smart Computing", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-01-23", "journal": {"name": "2023 IEEE International Conference on Big Data and Smart Computing (BigComp)", "pages": "395-398"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "103275096", "name": "L.
