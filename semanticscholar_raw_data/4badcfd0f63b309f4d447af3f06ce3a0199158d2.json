Due to its high time complexity, GPU-based solutions have been proposed for sub graph matching. Most existing GPU-based works can only cope with relatively small graphs that fit in GPU memory. To support efficient subgraph matching on large graphs, we propose a view-based method to hide communication overhead and improve GPU utilization. We develop VSGM, a sub graph matching framework that supports efficient pipelined execution and multi-GPU architecture. Ex-tensive experimental evaluation shows that VSGM significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions.", "venue": "International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-11-01", "journal": {"name": "SC22: International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis", "pages": "1-15"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "10721810", "name": "Guanxian Jiang"}, {"authorId": "2165760706", "name": "Qihui Zhou"}, {"authorId": "35295263", "name": "Tatiana Jin"}, {"authorId": "2140550986", "name": "Boyang Li"}, {"authorId": "8890418", "name": "Yunjian Zhao"}, {"authorId": "2110464837", "name": "Yichao Li"}, {"authorId": "1717691", "name": "James Cheng"}], "citations": []}
