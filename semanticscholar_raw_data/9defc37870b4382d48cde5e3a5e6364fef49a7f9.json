Landslides threaten infrastructure, including roads, railways, buildings, and human life. Hazard-based spatial planning and early warning systems are cost-effective strategies to reduce the risk to society from landslides. However, these both rely on data from previous landslide events, which is often scarce. Many deep learning (DL) models have recently been applied for landside mapping using medium- to high-resolution satellite images as input. However, they often suffer from sensitivity problems, overfitting, and low mapping accuracy. This study addresses some of these limitations by using a diverse global landslide dataset, using different segmentation models, such as Unet, Linknet, PSP-Net, PAN, and DeepLab and based on their performances, building an ensemble model. The ensemble model achieved the highest F1-score (0.69) when combining both Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 bands, with the highest average improvement of 6.87 % when the ensemble size was 20. On the other hand, Sentinel-2 bands only performed very well, with an F1 score of 0.61 when the ensemble size is 20 with an improvement of 14.59 % when the ensemble size is 20. This result shows considerable potential in building a robust and reliable monitoring system based on changes in vegetation index dNDVI only.", "venue": "Social Science Research Network", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-09-12", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2310.05959"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2205085336", "name": "Alexandra Jarna Ganer\u00f8d"}, {"authorId": "2256988993", "name": "Gabriele Franch"}, {"authorId": "2256989249", "name": "Erin Lindsay"}, {"authorId": "2256976613", "name": "Martina Calovi"}], "citations": []}
