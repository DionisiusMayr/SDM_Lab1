The continuous rapid growth in the volume of data like people's lifestyles, daily habits, and intended to save data from textual to images, videos, etc. have created a new problem and it's not handled by any traditional technologies. Solving this problem through the creation of a new paradigm: Big Data. But big data is a double-edged sword means it brings solution volume of data but also brings certain risks also in terms of privacy and security.it is difficult to handle the security and privacy of the data in this paper we are discussing the Big data 10V's characteristics, challenges of the big data and it's a solution with research in all perspective area.", "venue": "International Journal of Computer Applications", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2020-08-17", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Computer Applications"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2005338785", "name": "Parth Sabhadiya"}, {"authorId": "2005338839", "name": "Nayankumar Sorathiya"}, {"authorId": "2004516701", "name": "Vaikunth Desai"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "12df7a311ba2df1057024cab2bfbb0c5cfb8a2cc", "title": "Study on the optimization of the cultivation path of finance professionals in universities in the digital era"}, {"paperId": "4219d14eed8cbd3b08968eb026e4e61c4dbcbff0", "title": "Privacy and Security of Big Data-A High Perspective Investigation"}]}
