The advent of inexpensive, high-quality cameras has led to a rapid increase in the volume of generated video data [19, 16]. It is now feasible to automatically analyze these video datasets at scale due to two developments over the last decade. First, researchers have designed complex, computationally-intensive deep learning (DL) models that capture the contents of a given set of video frames (e.g., objects present in a particular frame [11]) [15]. Second, the computational capabilities of hardware accelerators for evaluating these DL models have increased over the last decade (e.g., TPUs) [8]. We anticipate that automated analysis of videos will reduce the labor cost of analyzing video", "venue": "SIGMOD record", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-01-31", "journal": {"name": "ACM SIGMOD Record", "pages": "39 - 40", "volume": "50"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "145426241", "name": "Joy Arulraj"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "3a29a9e6168cf1620fe76b3702e473de6f6fec67", "title": "Saturn: An Optimized Data System for Multi-Large-Model Deep Learning Workloads"}, {"paperId": "d147d89a8eeff1f5b0380aeb7881388be9fea5e6", "title": "EdgeServe: A Streaming System for Decentralized Model Serving"}]}
