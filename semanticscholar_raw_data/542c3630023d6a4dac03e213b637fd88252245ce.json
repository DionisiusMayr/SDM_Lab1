Such simulations require large amounts of heterogeneous data ranging from spatio-temporal to standard object properties. This and the increasing demand for large scale and real-time simulations pose many challenges for data management. In this paper, we present the architecture of a typical agent-based simulation system, describe several data management challenges that arise in such a data ecosystem, and discuss their current solutions within our multi-agent simulation system MARS.", "venue": "Datenbanksysteme f\u00fcr Business, Technologie und Web", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"pages": "423-436"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "31233292", "name": "Daniel Glake"}, {"authorId": "24033128", "name": "Fabian Panse"}, {"authorId": "144929258", "name": "N.
