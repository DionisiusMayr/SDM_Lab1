An experimental setup of a laboratory ball mill with an inner diameter of 238 mm, a high-speed camera, and a digital tachometer are used. The used equipment aims to investigate the behavior of the ball mill by using various 3D printed materials to produce the drum and grinding bodies. Applying the most used modes of grinding work in ball mills-70%, 75%, and 80% of the critical speed of the laboratory ball mill depending of the 3D materials was measured the separation angle and chosen the most appropriate speed for the most efficient grinding. The mill is filled with 20% of its volume. The work regimes, the volume of the mill, and parameters of the 3D printed materials are determined experimentally.", "venue": "2022 26th International Conference on Circuits, Systems, Communications and Computers (CSCC)", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-07-01", "journal": {"name": "2022 26th International Conference on Circuits, Systems, Communications and Computers (CSCC)", "pages": "327-331"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "151155982", "name": "N.
