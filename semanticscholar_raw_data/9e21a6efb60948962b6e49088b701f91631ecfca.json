In recent years, deep learning has been successfully applied to landslide susceptibility assessment due to the strong ability of fitting. However, in actual applications, the number of labeled samples is usually not sufficient for the training component. In this paper, a deep neural network model based on semi-supervised learning (SSL-DNN) for landslide susceptibility is proposed, which makes full use of a large number of spatial information (unlabeled data) with limited labeled data in the region to train the mode. Taking Jiaohe County in Jilin Province, China as an example, the landslide inventory from 2000 to 2017 was collected and 12 metrological, geographical, and human explanatory factors were compiled. Meanwhile, supervised models such as deep neural network (DNN), support vector machine (SVM), and logistic regression (LR) were implemented for comparison. Then, the landslide susceptibility was plotted and a series of evaluation tools such as class accuracy, predictive rate curves (AUC), and information gain ratio (IGR) were calculated to compare the prediction of models and factors. Experimental results indicate that the proposed SSL-DNN model (AUC = 0.898) outperformed all the comparison models. Therefore, semi-supervised deep learning could be considered as a potential approach for LSM.", "venue": "Applied Sciences", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2020-08-14", "journal": {"name": "Applied Sciences"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1609247773", "name": "Jingyu Yao"}, {"authorId": "9215202", "name": "Shengwu Qin"}, {"authorId": "93441768", "name": "S.
