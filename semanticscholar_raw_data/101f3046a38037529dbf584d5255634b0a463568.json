Much effort has been made to improve the performance of the sequence mapping process. In this paper, we propose BWA-MEM-SCALE which offers software-based acceleration techniques that fully utilize system resources to speed up genome sequence mapping. BWA-MEM-SCALE has two optimization mechanisms that exploit the system memory resource; Exact Match Filter (EMF) finds the input reads that match in full-length to the reference genome so that the expensive mapping process is bypassed for those reads. FM-index Accelerator (FMA) skips the prefix of sequences in seed matching with pre-assembled data. Moreover, we fully utilize the CPU cores in the system by carefully pipelining the mapping process and using in-memory index store. We implement the proposed mechanisms on BWA-MEM2 which is the state-of-the-art sequence mapping software. The evaluation shows that BWA-MEM-SCALE achieves substantial speedup compared to BWA-MEM2 when the system has a sufficient amount of resources. For example, with additional 104GB of memory, BWA-MEM-SCALE gives up to 3.32X speedup over BWA-MEM2. Because we support partially deploying the acceleration techniques, BWA-MEM-SCALE speeds up the mapping performance in proportion to the available system resource.
