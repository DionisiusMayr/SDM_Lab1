{"paperId": "954eefbb43fe8b10b8c0600911f93f515e7e2a71", "publicationVenue": null, "title": "Vertica-ML: Distributed Machine Learning in Vertica Database", "abstract": "A growing number of companies rely on machine learning as a key element for gaining a competitive edge from their collected Big Data. An in-database machine learning system can provide many advantages in this scenario, e.g., eliminating the overhead of data transfer, avoiding the maintenance costs of a separate analytical system, and addressing data security and provenance concerns. In this paper, we present our distributed machine learning subsystem within the Vertica database. This subsystem, Vertica-ML, includes machine learning functionalities with SQL API which cover a complete data science workflow as well as model management. We treat machine learning models in Vertica as first-class database objects like tables and views; therefore, they enjoy a similar mechanism for archiving and managing. We explain the architecture of the subsystem, and present a set of experiments to evaluate the performance of the machine learning algorithms implemented on top of it.", "venue": "SIGMOD Conference", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2020-05-29", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 2020 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "144861857", "name": "A.
