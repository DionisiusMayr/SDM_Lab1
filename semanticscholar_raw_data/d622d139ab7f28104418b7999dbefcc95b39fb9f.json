The postqualitative project was informed by new materialist and posthuman theorising. The researchers conducted their research at seven different early learning centres in NSW, Queensland, Victoria, and Finland. At the end of the project the researchers came together to make sense of the data across all sites and realised that their postqualitative data was BIG and that their \u2018little big data\u2019 was generated in the context of the increasing impact of \u2018big Big Data 1 .\u2019 We discuss our approaches to posthuman and new materialist big data in order to create a conversation between the two and to highlight the alternative methodological processes we developed to make sense of large bodies of postqualitative data.", "venue": "International Journal of Qualitative Studies in Education", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2020-04-23", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Qualitative Studies in Education", "pages": "277 - 294", "volume": "34"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2060913350", "name": "Margaret J.
