Tropical mountainous regions are often identified as landslide hotspots with\ngrowing population pressure. Anthropogenic factors are assumed to play a\nrole in the occurrence of landslides in these densely populated regions, yet\nthe relative importance of these human-induced factors remains poorly\ndocumented. In this work, we aim to explore the impact of forest cover\ndynamics, roads and mining activities on the characteristics and causes of\nlandslides in the rift flank west of Lake Kivu in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo). To do so, we\ncompile a comprehensive multi-temporal inventory of 2730 landslides. The\nlandslides are of different types and are grouped into five categories that\nare adapted to study the impact of human activities on slope stability: old\n(pre-1950s) and recent (post-1950s) deep-seated landslides, shallow\nlandslides, landslides associated with mining and landslides associated with road\nconstruction. We analyse the landslides according to this classification\nprotocol via frequency\u2013area statistics, frequency ratio distribution and\nlogistic regression susceptibility assessment. We find that natural factors\ncontributing to the cause of recent and old deep-seated landslides were\neither different or changed over time. Under similar topographic conditions,\nshallow landslides are more frequent, but of a smaller size, in areas where\ndeforestation has occurred since the 1950s. We attribute this size\nreduction to the decrease in regolith cohesion due to forest loss, which\nallows for a smaller minimum critical area for landsliding. In areas that\nwere already deforested in the 1950s, shallow landslides are less frequent,\nlarger and occur on less steep slopes. This suggests a combined role\nbetween regolith availability and soil management practices that influence\nerosion and water infiltration. Mining activities increase the odds of\nlandsliding. Landslides associated with mining and roads are larger than\nshallow landslides but smaller than the recent deep-seated instabilities,\nand they are controlled by environmental factors that are not present under\nnatural conditions. Our analysis demonstrates the role of human activities\non the occurrence of landslides in the Lake Kivu region. Overall, it\nhighlights the need to consider this context when studying hillslope\ninstability characteristics and distribution patterns in regions under\nanthropogenic pressure. Our work also highlights the importance of using\nlandslide classification criteria adapted to the context of the\nAnthropocene.\n", "venue": "Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2023-02-10", "journal": {"name": "Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1459887554", "name": "Jean-Claude Maki Mateso"}, {"authorId": "2837653", "name": "C.
