When a Tez developer faces the fulfillment of performance requirements s/he needs to configure and optimize the Tez application to specific execution contexts. However, these are not easy tasks, though the Apache Tez configuration will impact in the performance of the application significantly. Therefore, we propose some steps, towards the modeling and simulation of Apache Tez applications, that can help in the performance assessment of Tez designs. For the modeling, we propose a UML profile for Apache Tez. For the simulation, we propose to transform the stereotypes of the profile into stochastic Petri nets, which can be eventually used for computing performance metrics.", "venue": "ICPE Companion", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book"], "publicationDate": "2018-04-02", "journal": {"name": "Companion of the 2018 ACM/SPEC International Conference on Performance Engineering"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1940046", "name": "J.
