However, with these researches, effective target coverage has been a recurrent issue due to various factors like conflict between sensors and excessive waiting time for targets to be covered. In this paper, we proposed an algorithm based on queuing theory in tandem with mobile crowd sensing to tackle these issues. To do this, first, we develop some models which are based on the birth-and-death mechanism (one of the tools in queuing theory) to determine how long a target has to wait, the mean busy period of sensors and mean idle period of sensors. While developing these models, we consider cases where there exist a single sensor and  $n$ -sensors in the system. Based on these models, we develop the required algorithm. The simulation result shows that as the number of sensors increases relative to the number of targets, an average time before a target gets discovered is 0.2 s and sensor utilization decreasing toward zero as the number of sensors increases.", "venue": "IEEE Internet of Things Journal", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2017-03-28", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Internet of Things Journal", "pages": "1046-1055", "volume": "4"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "22398583", "name": "Alex Adim Obinikpo"}, {"authorId": "49890284", "name": "Y.
