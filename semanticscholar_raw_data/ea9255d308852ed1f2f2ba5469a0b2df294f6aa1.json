The study demonstrates that it is possible to achieve satisfying results with compact LLMs when fine-tuned on a specific dataset. The key contributions of this research include the creation of a fine-tuning dataset based on existing behavior trees using GPT-3.5 and a comprehensive comparison of multiple LLMs (namely llama2, llama-chat, and code-llama) across nine distinct tasks. To be thorough, we evaluated the generated behavior trees using static syntactical analysis, a validation system, a simulated environment, and a real robot. Furthermore, this work opens the possibility of deploying such solutions directly on the robot, enhancing its practical applicability. Findings from this study demonstrate the potential of LLMs with a limited number of parameters in generating effective and efficient robot behaviors.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-03-19", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2403.12761"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2284000315", "name": "Riccardo Andrea Izzo"}, {"authorId": "2933545", "name": "Gianluca Bardaro"}, {"authorId": "2262991853", "name": "Matteo Matteucci"}], "citations": []}
