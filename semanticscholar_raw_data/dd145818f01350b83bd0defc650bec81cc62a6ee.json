The use of microcontrollers and sensors in buildings is described as a level 3B maturity in the use of BIM. Design companies, contractors and building operators can use IoT solutions to monitor, analyze or manage processes. As a rule, solutions based on original Arduino boards are quite an expensive investment. The aim of this research was to find a low-cost IoT solution for monitoring, analysis and management, and integrate it with a BIM model. In the present study, an inexpensive NodeMCU microcontroller and a temperature and pressure sensor were used to study the thermal comfort of users in a single-family home. During the summer season, analysis of the monitored temperature can contribute to installation (HVAC) or retrofit work (for energy efficiency). The article presents a low-cost solution for studying the thermal comfort of users using a digital twin built-in BIM. Data obtained from sensors can support both the design and management processes. The main contribution of the article enables the design, construction and use of low-cost circuits (15.57 USD) even in small developments (single-family houses, semi-detached houses, terraced houses, atrium buildings). Combining IoT sensor telemetry with BIM (maturity level 3C) is a challenge that organizations will face in the near future.", "venue": "Journal of Sensor and Actuator Networks", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-02-29", "journal": {"name": "Journal of Sensor and Actuator Networks"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2219077738", "name": "A.
