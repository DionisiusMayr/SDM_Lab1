Customer segmentation is integral for sales, to identify customer groups to serve them appropriately. However, the novelty of such apps in a sales context raises the question: what challenges designers of such apps will face, in a sales context? To explore this question, we report our reflections on an IML study for customer clustering. We used data from a global manufacturing company to cluster customers using the Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) method. We applied a machine learning clustering model (K-Means) and discussed with seven seasoned sales managers the interaction with clusters. We report four challenges and foresee that designers of such systems will face, in the context of sales operations.", "venue": "CHI Extended Abstracts", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book"], "publicationDate": "2023-04-19", "journal": {"name": "Extended Abstracts of the 2023 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "145263477", "name": "Muhammad Raees"}, {"authorId": "145217563", "name": "Vassilis-Javed Khan"}, {"authorId": "2941421", "name": "Konstantinos Papangelis"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "91680c973c150ab7298c280e53add84fdc8129c1", "title": "On the Effect of Contextual Information on Human Delegation Behavior in Human-AI collaboration"}]}
