For online services, short-term allocation can speed up targeted query executions and free up cache lines reserved, but normally not needed, for performance. However, in collocated settings, short-term allocation can increase cache contention, slowing down collocated query executions. To offset slowdowns, collocated services may request short-term allocation more often, making the problem worse. Short-term allocation policies manage which queries receive cache allocations and when. In collocated settings, these policies should balance targeted query speedups against slowdowns caused by recurring cache contention. We present a model-driven approach that (1) predicts response time under a given policy, (2) explores competing policies and (3) chooses policies that yield low response time for all collocated services. Our approach profiles cache usage offline, characterizes the effects of cache allocation policies using deep learning techniques and devises novel performance models for short-term allocation with online services. We tested our approach using data processing, cloud, and high-performance computing benchmarks collocated on Intel processors equipped with Cache Allocation Technology. Our models predicted median response time with 11% absolute percent error. Short-term allocation policies found using our approach out performed state-of-the-art shared cache allocation policies by 1.2\u20132.3X.", "venue": "International Conference on Parallel Processing", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-08-29", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 51st International Conference on Parallel Processing"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2147295807", "name": "Christopher Stewart"}, {"authorId": "34197724", "name": "Nathaniel Morris"}, {"authorId": "14672072", "name": "L.
