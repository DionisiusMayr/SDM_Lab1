MoC is a process for evaluating and controlling modifications to facility design, operation, organization, or activities\u2014prior to implementation\u2014to be sure no new hazards are introduced. Traditionally, MoC is related to technical changes. Safety implications from organizational changes have recently led to proposed integrated management of both types. An inadequate MoC is recognized as a recurring cause of accidents, often resulting in major accidents, mainly in the process industry. Despite this recognised criticality, the MoC workflow in many companies is still far from being mature and there are still evident shortcomings in its application that have to be compensated. The technical solutions composed by the enabling technologies within Industry 4.0 can offer a valid support to overcome the MoC shortcomings, as will be discussed within this chapter.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "", "pages": "166-187", "volume": ""}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3158390", "name": "M.
