Even though ML pipelines provide bene\ufb01ts in terms of \ufb02exibility, extensibility, and scalability, there are many challenges when it comes to their reproducibility and data dependencies. Therefore, it is crucial to track and manage metadata and provenance of ML pipelines, including code, model, and data. The provenance information can be used by data scientists in developing and deploying ML models. It improves understanding complex ML pipelines and facilitates analyzing, debugging, and reproducing ML experiments. In this paper, we discuss ML use cases, challenges, and design goals of an ML provenance management tool to automatically expose the metadata. We introduce MLProvLab, a JupyterLab extension, to automatically identify the relationships between data and models in ML scripts. The tool is designed to help data scientists and ML practitioners track, capture, compare, and visualize the provenance of machine learning notebooks.", "venue": "International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Information Retrieval", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"pages": "274-281"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2136062866", "name": "Dominik Kerzel"}, {"authorId": "38718062", "name": "Sheeba Samuel"}, {"authorId": "1389035902", "name": "B.
