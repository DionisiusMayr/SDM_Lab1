With the continuous development and launch of high-resolution satellites, satellite images have covered multiple chromatograms such as multispectral, panchromatic, and hyperspectral. Hence, using the state-of-the-art models to construct the efficient model will be the essential way of promoting the development. Firstly, this research work analyzes the remote sensing as the service for the analysis of data collection. In the process of data update, it is necessary to then pay attention to the full use of existing information, therefore the decision tree is used for further analysis. Secondly, urban model is designed to assist in constructing the smart cities. Through the test on the construct and service, the performance is studied in the experiment with the test on different scenarios.", "venue": "International Conference Intelligent Computing and Control Systems", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2021-05-06", "journal": {"name": "2021 5th International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Control Systems (ICICCS)", "pages": "1823-1826"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2119324034", "name": "Ling Chen"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "b1a925b95b93ff7338ede902a57e96f736a37516", "title": "SMART: A Secure Remote Sensing Solution for Smart Cities\u2019 Urban Areas"}]}
