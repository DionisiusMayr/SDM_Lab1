However, economic development planners have been relatively slow in introducing UDS into their toolkits. This reality is a disservice to the subfield and students. This article discusses the motivation and current practices of UDS in economic development, identifies successes and challenges, and suggests actions moving forward. Professional training, curriculum innovation, and support from departments, institutions, and the broader academic and professional communities are called for.", "venue": "Journal of planning education and research", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-10-27", "journal": {"name": "Journal of Planning Education and Research"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "50570066", "name": "L.
