We use big data components such as Hadoop, Spark, Hive, HBase, and Zookeeper to build a domain name server logs analysis system and improve the generalized suffix automaton algorithm to match the logs of telecom operator customers with the logs for building a registration information database. Finally, we make an online log analysis platform based on Spring boot to discriminate data. Experiments show that based on Spark technology, the operator resources resale analysis system can accurately match operator telecom customer logs from massive logs. This design is of great significance to realize the operator's network bandwidth business clean, efficient, and high-quality operation with building a harmonious development network environment.", "venue": "2022 International Conference on Computing, Robotics and System Sciences (ICRSS)", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-12-01", "journal": {"name": "2022 International Conference on Computing, Robotics and System Sciences (ICRSS)", "pages": "89-93"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "48029609", "name": "Mingyang Song"}, {"authorId": "2072783136", "name": "Zhenghong Jia"}, {"authorId": "2151496522", "name": "Yan Huang"}, {"authorId": "2186001525", "name": "Li Tang"}, {"authorId": "2213523703", "name": "Guojian Xu"}, {"authorId": "2212940099", "name": "Zhenggang Leng"}], "citations": []}
