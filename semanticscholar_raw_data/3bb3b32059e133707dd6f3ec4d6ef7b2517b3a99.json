As per mobile cloud computing paradigm, the data processing and storage are moved from the mobile device to a cloud. In the same time, Smart City services typically contain a set of applications with data sharing options. Most of the services in Smart Cities are actually mashups combined data from several sources. This means that access to all available data is vital to the services. And the mobile cloud is vital because the mobile terminals are one of the main sources for data gathering. In our work, we discuss criteria for selecting mobile cloud services.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2016, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2016-05-10", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/1605.02886"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1398609844", "name": "M.
