Different approaches were considered for parallelizing the existing clustering algorithms to run in a parallel manner for increasing the size of the dataset that can be processed by a computational system. This paper suggests an extended architecture of the BigTim platform such that to be capable of running clustering algorithms in a distributed manner on mobile devices. The paper presents an enhanced version of the BigTim platform, which will run clustering algorithms on a cluster of devices composed by mobile devices (mobile phones and tablets) and computers connected through a network and working together in a MapReduce manner.", "venue": "International Symposium on Applied Computational Intelligence and Informatics", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-05-01", "journal": {"name": "2020 IEEE 14th International Symposium on Applied Computational Intelligence and Informatics (SACI)", "pages": "000017-000022"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3081594", "name": "I.
