Database Management Systems have long shown that descriptive analytics can be supported quite effectively by enriching traditional aggregates with constructs such as Data Cubes and other ROLAPs \u2014 thus extending the optimizability and parallelizability of RDBMS. In this paper, we show that these benefits can now be extended to predictive analytics, e.g. clustering, classification and association, by using aggregates in declarative recursive queries. Therefore, we introduce KDDLog, a scalable framework which leverages recursive queries with aggregates and our newly-proposed chain aggregates to enable users to build or customize knowledge discovery models with concise and expressive queries. We further propose specialized compilation techniques for semi-naive fix-point computation in the presence of aggregates, and optimizations for complex recursive queries on distributed data platforms. We provide KDDLib to build knowledge discovery tasks and advanced interfaces to ease users of porting new models. Extensive evaluations on large-scale datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves promising performance gain while offering both increased generality and ease of programming knowledge discovery applications.", "venue": "IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2021-04-01", "journal": {"name": "2021 IEEE 37th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE)", "pages": "1260-1271"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2024664573", "name": "Youfu Li"}, {"authorId": "2143717242", "name": "Jin Wang"}, {"authorId": "47628976", "name": "Mingda Li"}, {"authorId": "2499545", "name": "Ariyam Das"}, {"authorId": "2150059168", "name": "Jiaqi Gu"}, {"authorId": "1712630", "name": "C.
