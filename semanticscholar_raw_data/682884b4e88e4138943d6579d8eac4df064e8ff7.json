This patient-centered care heavily leverages the latest technologies of artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics that support diagnosis, decision making and treatment. In this paper, we present the role of AI and robotic systems in this evolution, including example use cases. We categorize systems along multiple dimensions such as the type of system, the degree of autonomy, the care setting where the systems are applied, and the application area. These technologies have already achieved notable results in the prediction of sepsis or cardiovascular risk, the monitoring of vital parameters in intensive care units, or in the form of home care robots. Still, while much research is conducted around AI and robotics in health care, adoption in real world care settings is still limited. To remove adoption barriers, we need to address issues such as safety, security, privacy and ethical principles; detect and eliminate bias that could result in harmful or unfair clinical decisions; and build trust in and societal acceptance of AI.", "venue": "Frontiers in Medicine", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-07-06", "journal": {"name": "Frontiers in Medicine", "volume": "9"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2251210", "name": "K.
