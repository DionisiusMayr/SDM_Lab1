Two key challenges to achieving this are (i) heterogeneity in devices\u2019 compute resources and (ii) topology constraints on which devices can communicate. We are the first to address these challenges by developing a network-aware distributed learning optimization methodology where devices process data for a task locally and send their learnt parameters to a server for aggregation at certain time intervals. Unlike traditional federated learning frameworks, our method enables devices to offload their data processing tasks, with these decisions determined through a convex data transfer optimization problem that trades off costs associated with devices processing, offloading, and discarding data points. We analytically characterize the optimal data transfer solution for different fog network topologies, showing for example that the value of a device offloading is approximately linear in the range of computing costs in the network. Our subsequent experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets we collect confirm that our algorithms are able to improve network resource utilization substantially without sacrificing the accuracy of the learned model.", "venue": "IEEE Conference on Computer Communications", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2020-07-01", "journal": {"name": "IEEE INFOCOM 2020 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications", "pages": "2509-2518"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "47072314", "name": "Yuwei Tu"}, {"authorId": "151264628", "name": "Yichen Ruan"}, {"authorId": "35204200", "name": "Satyavrat Wagle"}, {"authorId": "145009961", "name": "Christopher G.
