The energy production and consumption are very high worldwide, demanding intelligent methods with real\u2010world implementation potentials for appropriate energy management. In this paper, we survey the existing intelligent load forecasting (ILF) systems, highlight their advantages and downsides, and briefly discuss the workflow of the employed literature. Furthermore, we debate on the existing load forecasting datasets and their features along with a brief overview of the challenges confronted by researchers using these datasets. Distinct from previous survey papers, we provide a detailed review of performance evaluation metrics and comparison of employed methods for energy load forecasting, thereby concluding the need of efficient, effective, and adoptable ILF methods functional in real\u2010world scenarios. Finally, we assess the employed techniques and deliver future research opportunities based on the derived conclusions from existing research works. This paper delivers the overall energy forecasting literature in a compact form with possible future insights for researchers working in ILF domain.", "venue": "International Journal of Energy Research", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2021-01-06", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Energy Research", "pages": "3590 - 3614", "volume": "45"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "144591441", "name": "Tanveer Hussain"}, {"authorId": "66624503", "name": "F.
