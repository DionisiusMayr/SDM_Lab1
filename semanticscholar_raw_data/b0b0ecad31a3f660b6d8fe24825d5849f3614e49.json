As a result, information technology (IT) job seekers and professionals must be aware of changes required in their respective fields. This study identified and ranked the most-used technologies, such as programming languages, databases, operating systems (OSs), and collaborative tools, specific to twenty-three (23) different IT roles. Furthermore, this study advocates that individuals focus on critical skills required in various domains to achieve career success. Similarly, individuals with a set of valued technical skills may decide whether to change jobs or roles if they are interested in a position that requires their current competence. The findings of this study can be helpful to career counselors, instructors, students, professionals, recruiters, curriculum designers, and decision-makers.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-04-01", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems", "pages": "795-806", "volume": "10"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2059016395", "name": "O.
