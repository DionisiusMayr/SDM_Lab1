DRAM latency continues to be a critical bottleneck for system performance. In this work, we develop a low-cost mechanism, called ChargeCache, that enables faster access to recently-accessed rows in DRAM, with no modifications to DRAM chips. Our mechanism is based on the key observation that a recently-accessed row has more charge and thus the following access to the same row can be performed faster. To exploit this observation, we propose to track the addresses of recently-accessed rows in a table in the memory controller. If a later DRAM request hits in that table, the memory controller uses lower timing parameters, leading to reduced DRAM latency. Row addresses are removed from the table after a specified duration to ensure rows that have leaked too much charge are not accessed with lower latency. We evaluate ChargeCache on a wide variety of workloads and show that it provides significant performance and energy benefits for both single-core and multi-core systems.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2018-05-08", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/1805.03969"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "40016363", "name": "Hasan Hassan"}, {"authorId": "3257164", "name": "Gennady Pekhimenko"}, {"authorId": "1920997", "name": "Nandita Vijaykumar"}, {"authorId": "1720084", "name": "Vivek Seshadri"}, {"authorId": "48893570", "name": "Donghyuk Lee"}, {"authorId": "144889368", "name": "O.
