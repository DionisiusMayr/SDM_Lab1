Currently, EDA tools have been migrating to high\u2010performance computing clusters (HPC) or the cloud to meet increasing computing and storage requirements. EDA tasks are scientific workflows, whose scheduling is a well\u2010known NP\u2010hard problem. In this paper, we propose a novel workflow scheduling algorithm HEWS, which achieves better performance through a novel hierarchical sorting method. We conducted a series of simulation experiments in different environments, and the experimental results show that our HEWS scheduling algorithm achieves better scheduling performance compared to several conventional scheduling methods, the waiting time and makespan of workflow are significantly reduced.", "venue": "Concurrency and Computation", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-11-01", "journal": {"name": "Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience", "volume": "35"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2189803152", "name": "Qihang Qiao"}, {"authorId": "2143804405", "name": "Lan Chen"}, {"authorId": "2114071614", "name": "H.
