However, considering global megatrends such as climate change and the need to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), it is a growing imperative for the manufacturing industry to become more sustainable. This opens the door to transforming the IoP into an Internet of Sustainable Production (loSP). Accordingly, this paper proposes a novel four-step loSP-framework that establishes an Information System (IS) allowing researchers and practitioners to acknowledge and adapt to the interconnected nature of sustainability. Further, to test its applicability, an inter- and cross-disciplinary perspective is adopted to illustrate case-related challenges, opportunities, and pathways - revealed by the proposed framework - in the example of a digital economy for sustainability data, strategic design of global production networks, human-robot collaboration, digital photonic production, and the textile industry. Together, the framework demonstrates the usefulness of generating holistic information on the interconnected nature of sustainability derived from process-specific and contextualized data, while simultaneously assessing the framework's utilization for sustainability, as well as the sustainability of its use.", "venue": "International Symposium on Technology and Society", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-09-13", "journal": {"name": "2023 IEEE International Symposium on Technology and Society (ISTAS)", "pages": "1-8"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2265672681", "name": "Sebastian Bernhard"}, {"authorId": "2265674188", "name": "Sebastian P\u00fctz"}, {"authorId": "2265674128", "name": "Calvin R\u00f6hl"}, {"authorId": "48861700", "name": "Ralph Baier"}, {"authorId": "2812191", "name": "P.
