In the era of Big Data, the production of mobility data has become massive and, consequently, performing such an operation in a centralized way is not feasible. In this article, we address the problem of Distributed Subtrajectory Join processing by utilizing the MapReduce programming model. Compared to traditional trajectory join queries, this problem is even more challenging since the goal is to retrieve all the \u201cmaximal\u201d portions of trajectories that are \u201csimilar.\u201d We propose three solutions: (i) a well-designed basic solution, coined DTJb; (ii) a solution that uses a preprocessing step that repartitions the data, labeled DTJr; and (iii) a solution that, additionally, employs an indexing scheme, named DTJi. In our experimental study, we utilize a 56GB dataset of real trajectories from the maritime domain, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the largest real dataset used for experimentation in the literature of trajectory data management. The results show that DTJi performs up to 16\u00d7 faster compared with DTJb, 10\u00d7 faster than DTJr, and 3\u00d7 faster than the closest related state-of-the-art algorithm.", "venue": "ACM Trans.
