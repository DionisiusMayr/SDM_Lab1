As standard database systems are not capable of delivering the required write performance, log-based systems, key-value stores, and other write-optimized data stores have emerged recently. However, the drawbacks of these systems are a fair query performance and the lack of suitable instant recovery mechanisms in case of system failures. In this article, we present ChronicleDB, a novel database system with a storage layout tailored for high write performance under fluctuating data rates and powerful indexing capabilities to support a variety of queries. In addition, ChronicleDB offers low-cost fault tolerance and instant recovery within milliseconds. Unlike previous work, ChronicleDB is designed either as a serverless library to be tightly integrated in an application or as a standalone database server. Our results of an experimental evaluation with real and synthetic data reveal that ChronicleDB clearly outperforms competing systems with respect to both write and query performance.", "venue": "ACM Transactions on Database Systems", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2019-10-15", "journal": {"name": "ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS)", "pages": "1 - 45", "volume": "44"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "48021246", "name": "M.
