Over 50 billion devices, globally-connected, make up the largest network that is stepping towards the fourth industrial revolution, and which will significantly change the system of values and business systems. In the world of heterogeneous communication technologies, choosing the optimal one is a challenge for system architects, which is not an easy task often. The paper presents a comparative analysis of widespread communication technologies in the domain of IoT, and the conclusions presented based on the performed analysis, provide a better insight into the choice of the optimal solution depending on the problem domain and therefore better quality of solutions based on the concept of IoT.", "venue": "2020 19th International Symposium INFOTEH-JAHORINA (INFOTEH)", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2020-03-01", "journal": {"name": "2020 19th International Symposium INFOTEH-JAHORINA (INFOTEH)", "pages": "1-6"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1641959497", "name": "Miljan Sikimi\u0107"}, {"authorId": "1641979053", "name": "Mom\u010dilo Amovi\u0107"}, {"authorId": "2775983", "name": "V.
