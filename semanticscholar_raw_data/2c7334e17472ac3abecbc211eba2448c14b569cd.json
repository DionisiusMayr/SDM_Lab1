To expedite such big data processing, distributed stream processing systems (DSPS) are commonly used. However, because the rate of incoming messages to DSPS can vary depending on a stream application and execution environments such as like network conditions, it can be challenging to provide the necessary quality of services (QoS). Modern DSPS typically use heuristic or meta-heuristic algorithms to find near-optimal solutions to meet QoS requirements; however, it is still difficult to accomplish multiple QoS goals at once. In this paper, multiple meta-heuristic algorithms are evaluated to determine if they can simultaneously achieve multiple objectives, including response time and system failure. We implemented schedulers using various meta-heuristic algorithms operating within DSPS simulation environments. Then, we executed three stream applications utilizing various scheduling algorithms and demonstrated that meta-heuristic algorithms outperform a conventional algorithm.", "venue": "Pacific Rim International Symposium on Dependable Computing", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-11-01", "journal": {"name": "2022 IEEE 27th Pacific Rim International Symposium on Dependable Computing (PRDC)", "pages": "252-255"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2116536239", "name": "Dohan Kim"}, {"authorId": "2147235251", "name": "Aming Wu"}, {"authorId": "2289801", "name": "Young-Woo Kwon"}], "citations": []}
