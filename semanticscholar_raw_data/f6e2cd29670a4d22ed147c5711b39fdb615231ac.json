In recent years, many ML-based recommenders and analysers have been built; however, their scope is limited to using a single filtering technique and processing with clustering-based predictions. This paper aims to provide a systematic year-wise survey and evolution of these existing recommenders and analysers in specific deep learning-based hybrid filtering categories using movie datasets. They are compared to others based on their problem analysis, learning factors, data sets, performance, and limitations. Most contributions are found with collaborative filtering using user or item similarity and deep learning for the IMDB datasets. In this direction, this paper introduces a new and efficient Hybrid Filtering based Recommendation System using Deep Learning (HFRS-DL), which includes multiple layers and stages to provide a better solution for generating recommendations.", "venue": "", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2243748948", "name": "Mayank Sharma"}, {"authorId": "2242604341", "name": "Syed Akhter"}], "citations": []}
