It relies on complex pipelines and computational models for data processing, that are commonly designed collaboratively by scientists with diverse backgrounds for a variety of software stacks and computation environments. Here, a major challenge is the uncertainty about the correctness of analysis results, due to the high complexity of both, the actual data and the implemented analysis steps, and the continuous reuse and adaptation of data analysis pipelines in different application settings. This PhD project investigates how the design, adaptation, and evaluation of exploratory data analysis pipelines can be supported through automated plausibility assessment. To this end, we outline the requirements, our approach, and initial results for models and methods to enable plausibility checking in the context of exploratory data analysis.", "venue": "PhD@VLDB", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2067761643", "name": "Hermann Stolte"}], "citations": []}
