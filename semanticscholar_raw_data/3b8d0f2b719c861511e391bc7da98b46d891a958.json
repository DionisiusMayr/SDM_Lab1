Unfortunately, limited information is available about the depth and extent of landslides. Therefore, in order to identify landslide-prone zones in advance, a well-planned landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) approach is needed. The present study evaluates the efficacy of an MCDA-based model (analytical hierarchy process (AHP)) and determines the most accurate approach for detecting landslide-prone zones in one part of Darjeeling, India. LSM is prepared using remote sensing thematic layers such as slope, rainfall earthquake, lineament density, drainage density, geology, geomorphology, aspect, land use and land cover (LULC), and soil. The result obtained is classified into four classes, i.e., very high (11.68%), high (26.18%), moderate (48.87%), and low (13.27%) landslide susceptibility. It is observed that an entire 37.86% of the area is in a high to very high susceptibility zone. The efficiency of the LSM was validated with the help of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve, which demonstrate an accuracy of 96.8%, and the success rate curve showed an accuracy of 81.3%, both of which are very satisfactory results. Thus, the proposed framework will help natural disaster experts to reduce land vulnerability, as well as aid in future development.", "venue": "Applied Sciences", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-04-18", "journal": {"name": "Applied Sciences"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "50184380", "name": "A.
