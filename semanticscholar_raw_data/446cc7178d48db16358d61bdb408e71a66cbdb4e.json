The ever-increasing demand for cloud computing and heavy dependence on cloud for storage, processing, and applications results in the need for more data centers with high capacity. Power management using wireless sensor networks (WSN) can be a potential solution as there has been a lot of works suing WSN for power management for green buildings, green home, and green farming. The same design can be applied to data centers with modifications to cater for data centers. Since WSN is part of IoT, various IoT-related solutions can be proposed for green data center solutions. A hybrid model that consists of virtualization, cooling systems, and IoT shows energy efficient data center designs. There have been various efforts as such, and this research will present green energy designs and mainly IoT-related initiatives for green-aware data centers.", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "", "pages": "225-246", "volume": ""}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2321928", "name": "V.
