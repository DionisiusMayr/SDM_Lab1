Many organizations are migrating their legacy systems from a local machine to the cloud so as to reuse the legacy systems as well as improve the performance of big data processing. The MapReduce model of cloud computing makes parallel and distributed programming over a cluster of machines more convenient. This paper presents an approach to refactor the specific sequential code into MapReduce model in cloud migration, and proposes a tool to support the process of code refactoring.", "venue": "2018 IEEE Intl Conf on Parallel & Distributed Processing with Applications, Ubiquitous Computing & Communications, Big Data & Cloud Computing, Social Computing & Networking, Sustainable Computing & Communications (ISPA/IUCC/BDCloud/SocialCom/SustainCom)", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2018-12-01", "journal": {"name": "2018 IEEE Intl Conf on Parallel & Distributed Processing with Applications, Ubiquitous Computing & Communications, Big Data & Cloud Computing, Social Computing & Networking, Sustainable Computing & Communications (ISPA/IUCC/BDCloud/SocialCom/SustainCom)", "pages": "1042-1043"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2145804402", "name": "Junfeng Zhao"}, {"authorId": "2157016391", "name": "Wenmeng Wang"}, {"authorId": "7542498", "name": "Hongji Yang"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "04f000b777529ac65fd8190b33390903fdffa05b", "title": "An Interactive System for Web Testing through Selenium Web Driver and Web Page Downloading"}]}
