The growth in climate data leads to new opportunities for climate studies at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Managing, analyzing and processing of big climate data is considered to be challenging because of huge data volume. In this work multidimensional climate data such as precipitation and temperature are processed and analyzed in the Spark MapReduce Platform, since Spark platform is computationally more efficient than Hadoop-MapReduce Platform of same configuration. In temporal scale monthly and seasonal analysis of climate data has been carried out to understand the regional climate. The prediction of Rainfall on monthly and seasonal time scales is very much important for planning and devising agricultural strategies and disaster management, etc. As the prediction of climate state is very challenging, in this study an attempt is being made for the prediction of the rainfall using the time series analysis in the same framework. As a test case the time series approach such as Auto Regression Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) has been used for the prediction of rainfall. The proposed approach is evaluated and found to be accurate in the analysis and prediction of climate data and this will surely guide for the researcher for better understanding of the climate and its application to multiple sectors.", "venue": "International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2180930192", "name": "Radhika T V"}, {"authorId": "48611885", "name": "K.
