However, prior streaming systems either focus on stream computation, or are not stateful, or cannot provide low latency and high throughput to handle the fast-evolving linked data and increasing concurrency of queries. This paper presents Wukong+S, a distributed stream querying engine that provides sub-millisecond stateful query at millions of queries per-second over fast-evolving linked data. Wukong+S uses an integrated design that combines the stream processor and the persistent store with efficient state sharing, which avoids the cross-system cost and sub-optimal query plan in conventional composite designs (e.g., Storm/Heron+Wukong). Wukong+S uses a hybrid store to differentially manage timeless data and timing data accordingly and provides an efficient stream index with locality-aware partitioning to facilitate fast access to streaming data. Wukong+S further provides decentralized vector timestamps with bounded snapshot scalarization to scale with nodes and massive queries at efficient memory usage. We have designed Wukong+S conforming to the RDF data model and Continuous SPARQL (C-SPARQL) query interface and have implemented Wukong+S by extending a state-of-the-art static RDF store (namely Wukong). Evaluation on an 8-node RDMA-capable cluster using LSBench and CityBench shows that Wukong+S significantly outperforms existing system designs (e.g., CSPARQL-engine, Storm/Heron+Wukong, and Spark Streaming/Structured Streaming) for both latency and throughput, usually at the scale of orders of magnitude.", "venue": "Symposium on Operating Systems Principles", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy":
