It is a fundamental problem in modern applications and the objects considered may be as diverse as locations in space, text documents, images, twitter messages, or trajectories of moving objects. A generic and unifying approach is metric space, which organizes the set of objects solely by a distance (similarity) function with certain natural properties. Given a set of objects S with a metric distance function, we can create a Voronoi partitioning of S by selecting a subset C \u2282 S as centers and assigning each element of S to its closest center in C . This can be used to organize index structures as well as distributed computation (e.g. similarity join or similarity clustering). In this paper, we propose a novel index structure, the N-tree (neighborhood tree), which is essentially a hierarchical Voronoi partitioning. In addition, distances between all centers within a node are precomputed. This enables powerful pruning techniques for range search and kNN search, to avoid many of the expensive distance calculations. We provide a thorough experimental evaluation of parameter settings and comparison with state-of-the-art structures. In many cases, N-tree is the most efficient structure.", "venue": "", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2286555044", "name": "Ralf Hartmut G\u00a8uting"}, {"authorId": "2157692899", "name": "Suvam Kumar Das"}, {"authorId": "2286531727", "name": "Fabio Vald\u00b4es"}, {"authorId": "144540209", "name": "S.
