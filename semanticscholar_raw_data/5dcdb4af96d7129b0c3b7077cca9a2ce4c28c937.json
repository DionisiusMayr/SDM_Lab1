However, such pairwise connections fail to consider the interactions among more agents, which may be indirectly connected. Such non-pairwise or higher-order connections can be signified by involving simplicial complexes. The higher-order connections become even more noteworthy when it comes to neuronal network synchronization, an emerging phenomenon responsible for the many biological processes in real-world phenomena. However, involving higher-order interactions may considerably increase the computational costs. To confound this issue, map-based models are more suitable since they are faster, simpler, more flexible, and computationally more optimal. Therefore, this paper addresses the impact of pairwise and non-pairwise neuronal interactions on the synchronization state of 10 coupled memristive Hindmarsh\u2013Rose neuron maps. To this aim, electrical, inner linking, and chemical synaptic functions are considered as two- and three-body interactions in three homogeneous and two heterogeneous cases. The results show that through chemical pairwise and non-pairwise synapses, the neurons achieve synchrony with the weakest coupling strengths.", "venue": "Mathematics", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-06-22", "journal": {"name": "Mathematics"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1642325072", "name": "Mahtab Mehrabbeik"}, {"authorId": "2061583862", "name": "Atefeh Ahmadi"}, {"authorId": "9390477", "name": "F.
