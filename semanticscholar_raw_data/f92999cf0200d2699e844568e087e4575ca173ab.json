However, prior disaggregation systems are designed for native applications; in addition, all of them require applications to possess excellent locality to be ef\ufb01-ciently executed. In contrast, programs written in managed languages are subject to periodic garbage collection (GC), which is a typical graph workload with poor locality. Although most datacenter applications are written in managed languages, current systems are far from delivering acceptable performance for these applications. This paper presents Semeru , a distributed JVM that can dramatically improve the performance of managed cloud applications in a memory-disaggregated environment. Its design possesses three major innovations: (1) a universal Java heap, which provides a uni\ufb01ed abstraction of virtual memory across CPU and memory servers and allows any legacy program to run without modi\ufb01cations ; (2) a distributed GC, which of\ufb02oads object tracing to memory servers so that tracing is performed closer to data ; and (3) a swap system in the OS kernel that works with the runtime to swap page data ef\ufb01-ciently. An evaluation of Semeru on a set of widely-deployed systems shows very promising results.", "venue": "", "year": null, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2286318536", "name": "Chenxi Wang"}, {"authorId": "2037689378", "name": "Haoran Ma"}, {"authorId": "2265936", "name": "Shiafun Liu"}, {"authorId": "2286567328", "name": "Ucla Yuanqi Li"}, {"authorId": "2286543172", "name": "Mit Zhenyuan Ruan"}, {"authorId": "2287908045", "name": "Khanh Nguyen"}, {"authorId": "2286344897", "name": "Michael D.
