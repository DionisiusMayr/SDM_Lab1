IoT can be defined as interconnected small smart devices linked over the Internet to communicate with each other to perform meaningful action.There are major concerns regarding the security of data being produced from millions of devices in the IoT system. Di ff erent security concerns in various IoT system tiers have been covered in this study. IoT security concerns can be reduced by using Blockchain Technology, which is a decentralized distributed ledger with several Blockchain potentials, including persistence, transparency, verifiability, encryption, and operationaly strong The paper reviews whether they make a good fit along with certain challenges of Blockchain that should be examined while integrating it with IoT for resolving various security issues.", "venue": "International Journal of Computing and Digital Systems", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2024-01-15", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Computing and Digital Systems"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "67342912", "name": "Nishant Sanghani"}, {"authorId": "1855966", "name": "Bhavesh Borisaniya"}], "citations": []}
