To users, GraphRex presents a declarative, Datalog-like interface that is natural and expressive. Underneath, it compiles those queries into efficient implementations. A key technical contribution of GraphRex is the identification and optimization of a set of global operators whose efficiency is crucial to the good performance of datacenter-based, large graph analysis. Our experimental results show that GraphRex significantly outperforms existing frameworks---both high- and low-level---in scenarios ranging across a wide variety of graph workloads and network conditions, sometimes by two orders of magnitude.", "venue": "SIGMOD Conference", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2019-06-25", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 2019 International Conference on Management of Data"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2112197162", "name": "Qizhen Zhang"}, {"authorId": "11023018", "name": "A.
