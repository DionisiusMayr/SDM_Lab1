With the increased growth of the data produced by our digital world, deep learning becomes inevitable in providing solutions to the complex and real world problems. It is not far for the researchers to find the solutions for the complex problems to be solved till date such as birth of stars, genetic mutations, cosmological and even the birth and extended life of living organisms. Deep learning will definitely be the active component in finding solutions to such problems. This paper makes an attempt to present the research studies in deep learning with various perspectives.", "venue": "", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "66711696", "name": "C.
