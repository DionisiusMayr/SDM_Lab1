Unfortunately, it is also an expensive practice - Google and Mozilla estimate their CI systems in millions of dollars. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for reducing the cost of CI. The cost of CI lies in the computing power to run builds and its value mostly lies on letting developers find bugs early - when their size is still small. Thus, we target reducing the number of builds that CI executes by still executing as many failing builds as early as possible. To achieve this goal, we propose SmartBuildSkip, a technique which predicts the first builds in a sequence of build failures and the remaining build failures separately. SmartBuildSkip is customizable, allowing developers to select different preferred trade-offs of saving many builds vs. observing build failures early. We evaluate the motivating hypothesis of SmartBuildSkip, its prediction power, and its cost savings in a realistic scenario. In its most conservative configuration, SmartBuildSkip saved a median 30% of builds by only incurring a median delay of 1 build in a median of 15% failing builds.", "venue": "International Conference on Software Engineering", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2020-06-27", "journal": {"name": "2020 IEEE/ACM 42nd International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE)", "pages": "13-25"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "47540780", "name": "Xianhao Jin"}, {"authorId": "2897094", "name": "Francisco Servant"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "636cb1d19992772265309a2b2c853272eca317e9", "title": "Resource Usage and Optimization Opportunities in Workflows of GitHub Actions"}, {"paperId": "5b0cca06fef3c96b6aa5e733a1fcab36d5f3da61", "title": "The Why, When, What, and How About Predictive Continuous Integration: A Simulation-Based Investigation"}, {"paperId": "58bceff0b8dcc2e24ac7bb194212007d2c6896ed", "title": "Study of the contextual factors of a project affecting the build performance in Continuous Integration"}, {"paperId": "2c9b85104ac4dddaba0f22a5749e0ef2a909a817", "title": "OneSpace: Detecting cross-language clones by learning a common embedding space"}, {"paperId": "c5e4d3ef6d61cbeea895863856501e2e35a67dd0", "title": "Optimizing Continuous Development by Detecting and Preventing Unnecessary Content Generation"}, {"paperId": "b79c577ea0b3f1b3477e3268a19b06a50e9782d1", "title": "Accelerating Continuous Integration with Parallel Batch Testing"}, {"paperId": "f047334f1b465306745180ecdcca8f721614fdb2", "title": "State-Of-The-Practice in Quality Assurance in Java-Based Open Source Software Development"}, {"paperId": "3f06dcb2a0a153658dd894adfa8f1a2c5b598012", "title": "Systematic Literature Review on Application of Machine Learning in Continuous Integration"}, {"paperId": "a1fb9327089adaef4d09c496b8dd10183378dda5", "title": "Studying the Interplay Between the Durations and Breakages of Continuous Integration Builds"}, {"paperId": "b49a3d0e3e22590887a6fc3c5dab4ee778ac5246", "title": "Optimizing Continuous Integration by Dynamic Test Proportion Selection"}, {"paperId": "1a8ef041082ff117a0af3c2000ea402672bab239", "title": "On the usage, co-usage and migration of CI/CD tools: A qualitative analysis"}, {"paperId": "9e88a6e3f1068fd4c265966167919d5de70feb55", "title": "HybridCISave: A Combined Build and Test Selection Approach in Continuous Integration"}, {"paperId": "9f918a1ceb87e5c05cf1e9184322cdea42731380", "title": "Detecting Continuous Integration Skip Commits Using Multi-Objective Evolutionary Search"}, {"paperId": "dea3cac9612d5681f0b30579b6df9532ee1548e6", "title": "BuildSonic: Detecting and Repairing Performance-Related Configuration Smells for Continuous Integration Builds"}, {"paperId": "d571264556e6d5b88bf2856ce0bd1756b1bbb545", "title": "Lessons from Eight Years of Operational Data from a Continuous Integration Service: An Exploratory Case Study of CircleCI"}, {"paperId": "197d83b1a11088a00d3bace219b80df234bbd749", "title": "Which builds are really safe to skip?
