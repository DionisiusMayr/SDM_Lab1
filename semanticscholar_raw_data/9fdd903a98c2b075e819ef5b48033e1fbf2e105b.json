Certainly, many important contributions have been made in various application areas that are either directly or indirectly related to data analytics, and there are important theoretical developments made by scholars in our field. It is not our intention to provide a complete survey for data\u2010analytics work in our field. Instead, we focus only on the aspect of data integration in operational decision\u2010making by describing the most popular applications of data analytics.", "venue": "Social Science Research Network", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-09-08", "journal": {"name": "Production and Operations Management", "pages": "4544 - 4557", "volume": "31"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "145515365", "name": "Q.
