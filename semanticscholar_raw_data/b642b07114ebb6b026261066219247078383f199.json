To overcome this shortcoming, we study quantified MLNs which generalize MLNs by introducing statistical universal quantifiers, allowing to express also the latter type of statistics in a principled way. Our main technical contribution is to show that the standard reasoning tasks in quantified MLNs, maximum a posteriori and marginal inference, can be reduced to their respective MLN counterparts in polynomial time.", "venue": "International Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2018-07-03", "journal": {"pages": "602-612"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1400731651", "name": "V\u00edctor Guti\u00e9rrez-Basulto"}, {"authorId": "1804478", "name": "J.
