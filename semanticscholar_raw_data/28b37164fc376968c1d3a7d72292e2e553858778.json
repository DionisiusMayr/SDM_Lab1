Our query environment is customizable and user-friendly: it is settled on the basis of data source confidence and user's quality restrictions. These constraints are on queries not on sources. Inconsistent data is filtered, allowing the production of valid results even when data quality cannot be entirely ensured by sources. We elaborate on the process of validating answers to the queries against positive, negative and key constraints. Our validator can interact with divers lower-level query evaluation methods.", "venue": "", "year": 2016, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "", "volume": ""}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2023681", "name": "Jacques Chabin"}, {"authorId": "2114240", "name": "Mirian Halfeld-Ferrari"}, {"authorId": "47523812", "name": "Thanh Binh Nguyen"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "329ec98c927b18c8fc5039b3caa651f7824cdba2", "title": "L'interrogation du web de donn\u00e9es garantissant des r\u00e9ponses valides par rapport \u00e0 des crit\u00e8res donn\u00e9s.
