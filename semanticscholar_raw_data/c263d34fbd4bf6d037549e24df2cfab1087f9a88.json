The challenges of navigating SA transition are notably intricate in developing nations. To effectively embark on this transformative journey, strategic approaches are imperative, necessitating a thorough examination of the prevailing agricultural ecosystem. This study seeks to formulate strategies that advance Turkey\u2019s agricultural sector. The primary research questions focus on optimizing the benefits of SA by aligning strengths and opportunities with diverse socio-economic and environmental factors, while also exploring effective strategies to mitigate the impact of weaknesses and threats within the agricultural landscape. To achieve this objective, the utilization of the 2-Tuple linguistic (2TL) model integrated DEMATEL (Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory) methodology in conjunction with SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) and PESTLE (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, Environmental) analyses is proposed. The integration of linguistic variables enhances the capacity to delve deeper into system analysis, aligning more closely with human cognitive processes. The research commences with SWOT and PESTLE analyses applied to Turkey\u2019s agricultural sector. Subsequently, the 2TL-DEMATEL approach is employed to investigate interrelationships among analysis components. This inquiry aims to establish causal relations, facilitating the derivation of relevant strategies. The case study centers on Turkey, a developing country, with outcomes indicating that the highest-priority strategies revolve around addressing \u2018environmental threats\u2019 and \u2018economic weaknesses.\u2019 The subsequent evaluation encompasses eight dimensions, resulting in the generation of fifteen distinct strategies, a process facilitated by collaboration with field experts. Importantly, both the results and strategies undergo rigorous validation, drawing upon insights from the recent literature and field experts. Significantly, these findings align seamlessly with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), substantiating the study\u2019s broader significance in fostering a sustainable future for Turkey.", "venue": "Agriculture", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-12-15", "journal": {"name": "Agriculture"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "79861005", "name": "Deniz Uzt\u00fcrk"}, {"authorId": "1771524", "name": "G.
