Although PSO has been successful in many fields, solving optimization problems in big data applications often requires processing of massive amounts of data, which cannot be handled by traditional PSO on a single machine. There have been several parallel PSO based on Spark, however they are almost proposed for solving numerical optimization problems, and few for big data optimization problems. In this paper, we propose a new Spark-based parallel PSO algorithm to predict the co-authorship of academic papers, which we formulate as an optimization problem from massive academic data. Experimental results show that the proposed parallel PSO can achieve good prediction accuracy.", "venue": "Inf.", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-12-20", "journal": {"name": "Inf.", "pages": "530", "volume": "12"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2135156203", "name": "Congmin Yang"}, {"authorId": "2072832726", "name": "Tao Zhu"}, {"authorId": "2155581440", "name": "Yang Zhang"}, {"authorId": "52186545", "name": "Huansheng Ning"}, {"authorId": "2109222039", "name": "L.
