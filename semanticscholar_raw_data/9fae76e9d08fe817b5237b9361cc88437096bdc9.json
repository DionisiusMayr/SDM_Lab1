The analysis was developed using a sample of 2276 documents, which were reviewed in R software and analyzed with the assistance of the Bibliometrix package of the same software. The results indicate that there has been considerable productivity on the topic of real estate bubbles since 2007, with an emphasis on housing price formation processes and the social effects when bubbles burst. The authors found that there were not many case studies located in Latin America or Africa, nor were there approaches with advanced predictive modeling techniques using machine learning or artificial intelligence. The article provides an understanding of the state of the art in real estate bubble research and situates new research in front of the influential literature previously published.", "venue": "International Journal of Financial Studies", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-08-23", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Financial Studies"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1415745399", "name": "Jos\u00e9-Francisco Vergara-Perucich"}], "citations": []}
