The Internet of Everything is increasing data in both sizes and dimensions, such as locations, user preferences, trajectories etc. Many big data applications must deal with data in real time. These applications are running at a large scale and they require existing paralleled platforms handling faults and stragglers. There are two ways to deal with the problem of data fault tolerance. One is data backup, and the other is checkpoint strategy. However, data backup requires high hardware costs. The checkpoint strategy requires high synchronization costs in both computing and network bandwidth. Unlike traditional data recovery strategies, we try to present an Erasure-code based strategy in stream computing. When data streams arrive at a cluster, we apply the Erasure coding algorithm to encode data for each window. Once some data is lost, we recovery the missing part by decoding these data blocks. We evaluate our strategy in Spark Streaming by experiments. The results show that the availability of our strategy is confirmed, but the time cost is still to be improved.", "venue": "2020 International Conference on High Performance Big Data and Intelligent Systems (HPBD&IS)", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2020-05-01", "journal": {"name": "2020 International Conference on High Performance Big Data and Intelligent Systems (HPBD&IS)", "pages": "1-5"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1786364271", "name": "Minghui Lu"}, {"authorId": "2054594335", "name": "Chao Xiong"}, {"authorId": "2117799624", "name": "Xiaopeng Fan"}], "citations": []}
