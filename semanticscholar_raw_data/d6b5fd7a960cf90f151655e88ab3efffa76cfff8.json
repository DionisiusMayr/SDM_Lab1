The research presents a comparative perspective on cyberattacks in Colombia, aiming to identify the most effective machine learning methods for mitigating and preventing such threats. The study evaluates the performance of logistic regression, na\u00efve Bayes, perceptron, and k-nearest neighbors algorithms in the context of cyberattack prevention. Results reveal the strengths and weaknesses of these techniques in addressing the unique challenges posed by cyberattackers in Colombia\u2019s IoT infrastructure. The findings provide valuable insights for enhancing cybersecurity measures in the region and contribute to the broader field of IoT security.", "venue": "Electronics", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-02-20", "journal": {"name": "Electronics"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2287558268", "name": "Emanuel Ortiz-Ruiz"}, {"authorId": "2287534161", "name": "Juan Ram\u00f3n Bermejo"}, {"authorId": "2145866", "name": "J.
