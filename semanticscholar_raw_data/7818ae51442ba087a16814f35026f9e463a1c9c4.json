The former leads to slow response times for complex queries with random data accesses, especially when they require deep graph traversals. The latter, which is caused by missing connections and characteristics in graphs modeling real information, implies that any analysis based solely on explicitly stored data is bound to yield incomplete results. This work aims to develop a novel graph database architecture that leverages the power of Graph Machine Learning to equip graph queries with prediction capabilities while offering approximate but timely results to complex queries. We discuss challenges, design decisions, and research avenues required in materializing this prototype alongside the outline of the actively-pursued research plan.", "venue": "PhD@VLDB", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"pages": "33-36"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2059019171", "name": "Sonia-Florina Horchidan"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "ef33d4545e6346354d0db35375da5f41d2984885", "title": "GraphRARE: Reinforcement Learning Enhanced Graph Neural Network with Relative Entropy"}]}
