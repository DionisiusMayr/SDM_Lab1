While these systems can start processing queries quickly thanks to the agility and scalability of SL, they may encounter performance-and cost-bottlenecks based on workloads due to SL's worse performance and more expensive cost than traditional compute resources, e.g., virtual machine (VM). In this paper, we introduce Smartpick, a SL-enabled scalable data analytics system that exploits SL and VM together to realize composite benefits, i.e., agility from SL and better performance with reduced cost from VM. Smartpick uses a machine learning prediction scheme, decision-tree based Random Forest with Bayesian Optimizer, to determine SL and VM configurations, i.e., how many SL and VM instances for queries, that meet cost-performance goals. Smartpick offers a knob for applications to allow them to explore a richer cost-performance tradeoff space opened by exploiting SL and VM together. To maximize the benefits of SL, Smartpick supports a simple but strong mechanism, called relay-instances. Smartpick also supports event-driven prediction model retraining to deal with workload dynamics. A Smartpick prototype was implemented on Spark and deployed on live testbeds, Amazon AWS and Google Cloud Platform. Evaluation results indicate 97.05% and 83.49% prediction accuracies respectively with up to 50% cost reduction as opposed to the baselines. The results also confirm that Smartpick allows data analytics applications to navigate the richer cost-performance tradeoff space efficiently and to handle workload dynamics effectively and automatically.", "venue": "International Middleware Conference", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-07-25", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 24th International Middleware Conference"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "102533435", "name": "Anshuman Mohapatra"}, {"authorId": "2462977", "name": "Kwangsung Oh"}], "citations": []}
