Discriminative machine learning methods are used as they have the ability to learn without the knowledge of distribution type. The techniques used to accomplish research includes raw IQ radar data collection, data labelling, and feature generation, statistical significance of generated features, model (DT, SVM and ANN) training and model evaluation. The results indicate improvement in mitigation of ground clutter for different scenarios. The research also discusses the future work related to this research.", "venue": "Advanced Information Technologies and Applications", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2023-03-25", "journal": {"name": "Advanced Information Technologies and Applications"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "7340564", "name": "Malwinder Singh"}, {"authorId": "2214160977", "name": "Shashi Ranjan Kumar"}, {"authorId": "2214193499", "name": "Bhukya Soumya Mishra"}], "citations": []}
