In the context of high-precision industrial manufacturing, the output of these sensors can be exploited to leverage on human intelligence for monitoring the quality of the production. Nevertheless, in complex scenarios, the amount of sensed data could lead to a visual and acoustic overload for the Decision Maker. In this poster we propose a multi-modal user interface (UI) we devised to support the Decision Maker in monitoring the outcome of high-precision manufacturing machineries. In particular, to mitigate the acoustic and visual overloads, we propose the use of the haptic channel, both to control the playback of the collected data stream, and to get feedbacks about anomalous situations.", "venue": "International Working Conference on Advanced Visual Interfaces", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book"], "publicationDate": "2020-09-28", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the International Conference on Advanced Visual Interfaces"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2517508", "name": "S.
