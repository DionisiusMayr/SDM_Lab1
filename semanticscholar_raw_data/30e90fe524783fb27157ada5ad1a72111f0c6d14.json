Over a sequence of m insertions to an n-node graph where every edge has capacity O(poly(m)) our algorithm runs in time O(m \u221an \u00b7 \u0454\u22121). To obtain this result we design dynamic data structures for the more general problem of detecting when the value of the minimum cost circulation in a dynamic graph undergoing edge insertions achieves value at most F (exactly) for a given threshold F. Over a sequence m insertions to an n-node graph where every edge has capacity O(poly(m)) and cost O(poly(m)) we solve this thresholded minimum cost flow problem in O(m \u221an). Both of our algorithms succeed with high probability against an adaptive adversary. We obtain these results by dynamizing the recent interior point method by [Chen et al.\u2004FOCS 2022] used to obtain an almost linear time algorithm for minimum cost flow, and introducing a new dynamic data structure for maintaining minimum ratio cycles in an undirected graph that succeeds with high probability against adaptive adversaries.", "venue": "Symposium on the Theory of Computing", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-12-13", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 55th Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "145549761", "name": "Jan van den Brand"}, {"authorId": "47909156", "name": "Y.
