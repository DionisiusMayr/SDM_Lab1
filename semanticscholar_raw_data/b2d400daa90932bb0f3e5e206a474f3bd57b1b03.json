Some of the most popular social media and social networking sites that people use include Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and Twitter. Finding compatible persons to be friends on social media can be a challenge as many of the people recommended to the user by social media are people who are already friends with them or have been followed. However, when users are looking for friends, the real concern is whether they have common interests or hobbies with each other and whether they often interact with one another. In this paper, we propose friend recommendation algorithms revolving around music interests and interactions in social media.", "venue": "International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Sociology"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2018-08-01", "journal": {"name": "2018 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM)", "pages": "833-840"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "51410514", "name": "C.
