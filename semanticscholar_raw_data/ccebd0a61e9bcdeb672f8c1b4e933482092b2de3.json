Data enrichment is often performed using expensive machine learning models to interpret low-level data ( e . g ., models for face detection) into semantically meaningful observation. Col-lecting and enriching data offline before loading it to a database is infeasible if one desires online analysis on data as it arrives. Enriching data on the fly at insertion could result in redundant work (if applications require only a fraction of the data to be enriched) and could result in a bottleneck (if enrichment functions are expensive). Any scalable solution requires enrichment during query processing. This paper explores two different architectures for integrating enrichment into query processing \u2013 a loosely coupled approach wherein enrichment is performed outside of the DBMS and a tightly coupled approach wherein it is performed within the DBMS. The paper addresses the challenges of increased query latency due to query time enrichment.", "venue": "International Conference on Extending Database Technology", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"pages": "92-104"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2028613607", "name": "Dhrubajyoti Ghosh"}, {"authorId": "2028613957", "name": "Peeyush Gupta"}, {"authorId": "144156242", "name": "S.
