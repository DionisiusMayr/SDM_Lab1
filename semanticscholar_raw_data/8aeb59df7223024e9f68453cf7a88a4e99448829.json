Knowledge graph is an important branch technology of AI and the basis for data interconnection to knowledge interconnection services. Firstly, this paper carries out ontology modeling of geographic information. Secondly, Neo4j is used to semantically store the classification of fundamental geographic information and its geometric mapping relationship to construct the fundamental geographic information knowledge graph. Finally, experiments are conducted to verify the feasibility of graph-driven method by taking housing entity's production as an example. This method provides a new idea for the transformation and production of geospatial data in new fundamental surveying and mapping.", "venue": "GEOINFORMATICS", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-07-19", "journal": {"name": "2023 30th International Conference on Geoinformatics", "pages": "1-6"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2239242834", "name": "Shuai Ye"}, {"authorId": "2239696253", "name": "Naisheng Wang"}, {"authorId": "2239274463", "name": "Mu Bai"}, {"authorId": "2239222929", "name": "Xiaoliang Meng"}, {"authorId": "2239628003", "name": "Yuxuan Hu"}], "citations": []}
