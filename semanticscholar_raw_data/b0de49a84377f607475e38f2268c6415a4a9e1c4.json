However, if existing resource management frameworks in these systems lack the support for storage management, this would cause unpredictable performance degradation when applications are under input/output (I/O) contention. Storage management of data-intensive systems is a challenge. Big Data plays a most major role in storage systems for data-intensive computing. This article deals with these difficulties along with discussion of High Performance Computing (HPC) systems, background for storage systems for data-intensive applications, storage patterns and storage mechanisms for Big Data, the Top 10 Cloud Storage Systems for data-intensive computing in today's world, and the interface between Big Data Intensive Storage and Cloud/Fog Computing. Big Data storage and its server statistics and usage distributions for the Top 500 Supercomputers in the world are also presented graphically and discussed as data-intensive storage components that can be interfaced with Fog-to-cloud interactions and enabling protocols.", "venue": "International Journal of Fog Computing", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2019-01-01", "journal": {"name": "Int.
