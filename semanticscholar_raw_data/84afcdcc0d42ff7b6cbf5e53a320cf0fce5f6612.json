However, the rapid growth of the data generated by the current applications requires new data warehousing systems. In big data, it is important to adapt the existing warehouse systems to overcome new issues and limitations. The main drawbacks of traditional Extract\u2013Transform\u2013Load (ETL) are that a huge amount of data cannot be processed over ETL and that the execution time is very high when the data are unstructured. This paper focuses on a new model consisting of four layers: Extract\u2013Clean\u2013Load\u2013Transform (ECLT), designed for processing unstructured big data, with specific emphasis on text. The model aims to reduce execution time through experimental procedures. ECLT is applied and tested using Spark, which is a framework employed in Python. Finally, this paper compares the execution time of ECLT with different models by applying two datasets. Experimental results showed that for a data size of 1 TB, the execution time of ECLT is 41.8 s. When the data size increases to 1 million articles, the execution time is 119.6 s. These findings demonstrate that ECLT outperforms ETL, ELT, DELT, ELTL, and ELTA in terms of execution time.", "venue": "Big Data and Cognitive Computing", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-02-06", "journal": {"name": "Big Data Cogn.
