Learners have the capabilities to interact with the learning analytics system through adequate user interface. Such systems enables various features such as learning recommendations, visualizations, reminders, rating and self-assessments possibilities. This paper proposes a framework for learning analytics aimed to improve personalized learning environments, encouraging the learner\u2019s skills to monitor, adapt, and improve their own learning. It is an attempt to articulate the characterizing properties that reveals the association between learning analytics and personalized learning environment. In order to verify data analysis approaches and to determine the validity and accuracy of a learning analytics, and its corresponding to learning profiles, a case study was performed. The findings indicate that educational data for learning analytics are context specific and variables carry different meanings and can have different implications on learning success prediction.", "venue": "Vietnam Journal of Computer Science", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-03-20", "journal": {"name": "Vietnam.
