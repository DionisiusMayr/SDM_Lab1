Conversely, offloading DNNs to cloud servers incurs high communication overheads. Partitioning and early exiting are attractive solutions for reducing computational costs and improving inference speed. However, current work often addresses these approaches separately and/or ignores common communication intricacies on edge networks such as de(serialization) and data transmission overheads. We present PORTEND, a novel performance model that jointly optimizes partitioning, early exiting, and multi-tier network placement. PORTEND\u2019S novel approach outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions in edge computing setups, reducing the DNN inference latency by 29%.", "venue": "International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-12-17", "journal": {"name": "2023 IEEE 29th International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems (ICPADS)", "pages": "2475-2482"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2281369286", "name": "Maryam Ebrahimi"}, {"authorId": "2199260133", "name": "Alexandre da Silva Veith"}, {"authorId": "2281357979", "name": "Moshe Gabel"}, {"authorId": "2293637579", "name": "Eyal de Lara"}], "citations": []}
