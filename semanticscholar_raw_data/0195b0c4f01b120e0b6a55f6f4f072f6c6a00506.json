This paper offers a systematic analysis of existing metrics and introduces new ones, focusing on their theoretical underpinnings and practical implementations. We present empirical results and insights into the performance of selected metrics, elucidating the complex interplay of variables in the training process. Our comprehensive approach provides significant insights into LLM training, and promises to improve the dependability and efficiency of future models.", "venue": "2023 IEEE 34th International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering Workshops (ISSREW)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-10-09", "journal": {"name": "2023 IEEE 34th International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering Workshops (ISSREW)", "pages": "180-185"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2264992299", "name": "Wenyi Fang"}, {"authorId": "2265389087", "name": "Hao Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2264936400", "name": "Ziyu Gong"}, {"authorId": "2265392473", "name": "Longbin Zeng"}, {"authorId": "2265151221", "name": "Xuhui Lu"}, {"authorId": "2265143886", "name": "Biao Liu"}, {"authorId": "2264990297", "name": "Xiaoyu Wu"}, {"authorId": "2265244264", "name": "Yang Zheng"}, {"authorId": "2264954115", "name": "Zheng Hu"}, {"authorId": "2265080866", "name": "Xun Zhang"}], "citations": []}
