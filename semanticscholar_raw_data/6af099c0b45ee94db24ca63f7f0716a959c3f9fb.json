Many meta-heuristic optimization algorithms have been used in the solution of clustering problem. In this study, we have exploited two meta-heuristic optimization algorithms to solve the clustering problem: Harmony Search as traditional algorithm and Grey Wolf Optimizer as new generation algorithm. We have measured their clustering performance on five well-known, benchmark clustering datasets and compare the obtained results with each other and K-means which is a widely used classical clustering algorithm. The experimental results indicate that, while Grey Wolf Optimizer is generally superior to the other two algorithms in terms clustering success, the computation time of Harmony Search is less than Grey Wolf Optimizer for the same iteration number. In addition, the standard deviation of Grey Wolf Optimizer is smaller than the other two algorithms.", "venue": "", "year": null, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2003392025", "name": "Suheda Semih Acmali"}, {"authorId": "10666903", "name": "Y.
