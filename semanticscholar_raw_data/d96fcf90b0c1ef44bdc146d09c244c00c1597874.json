However, the traditional smart grid data management systems cannot scale and provide sufficient storage and processing capabilities. To address these challenges, this paper presents a smart grid big data eco-system based on the state-of-the-art Lambda architecture that is capable of performing parallel batch and real-time operations on distributed data. Furthermore, the presented eco-system utilizes a Hadoop Big Data Lake to store various types of smart grid data including smart meter, images, and video data. An implementation of the smart grid big data eco-system on a cloud computing platform is presented. To test the capability of the presented eco-system, real-time visualization and data mining applications were performed on the real smart grid data. The results of those applications on top of the eco-system suggest that it is capable of performing numerous smart grid big data analytics.", "venue": "IEEE Access", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2018-07-23", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Access", "pages": "40463-40471", "volume": "6"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "32580198", "name": "Amr A.
