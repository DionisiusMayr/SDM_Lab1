Electroencephalography (EEG) has gained significant attention for its potential to revolutionize healthcare applications. However, the effective utilization of EEG data in advancing medical diagnoses and treatment hinges on the availability and quality of relevant datasets. In this context, we conducted a scoping review to explore the wealth of EEG datasets designed for healthcare applications. This review serves as a critical exploration of the current landscape, aiming to identify datasets related to healthcare conditions while assessing their reusability. Our findings highlight both the opportunities and limitations in the wealth of open access EEG datasets. Available. As AI increasingly relies on high-quality, well labelled data, barriers impeding the sharing and utilization of EEG data for healthcare (such as lack of comprehensive documentation or adherence to FAIR principles) must be addressed so as to leverage the potential of advanced deep learning models to unlock new possibilities for diagnosis and analysis of a wide array of medical conditions.", "venue": "IEEE Access", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "IEEE Access", "pages": "39186-39203", "volume": "12"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2292426971", "name": "Caroline Peres da Silva"}, {"authorId": "118250285", "name": "Salvatore Tedesco"}, {"authorId": "2180679098", "name": "Brendan O\u2019Flynn"}], "citations": []}
