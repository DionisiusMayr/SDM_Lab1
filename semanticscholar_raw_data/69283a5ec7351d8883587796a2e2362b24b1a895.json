This study aims to apply Kernel Density Estimation based (KDE-based) clustering analysis and a threshold-based reverse flow incentive mechanism to encourage the users of bicycles to adjust the supply and demand actively. And it takes Shanghai Jing\u2019an Temple and its surroundings as the research area. Its practical steps include: (1) compilation and processing of the needed data, (2) application of KDE-based clustering, partitioning, and grading, and (3) incentives calculation based on dockless shared bicycle flow control system. The study finds that the generalization function of KDE-based clustering can be used to estimate the density value at any point in the study area to support the calculation of the incentive mechanism for bicycle reverse flow.", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2118433537", "name": "Shang-Yuan Chen"}, {"authorId": "150318095", "name": "Tzu-tien Chen"}], "citations": []}
