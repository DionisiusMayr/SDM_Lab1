Our solution relies on the definition of authorizations regulating access to data according to three different visibility levels (no visibility, encrypted visibility, and plaintext visibility). Data processing is performed by multiple providers based on the restrictions imposed by authorizations, which may require to adjust data visibility on the fly. We describe the structure of the query optimizer and show how the operations of a computation can be assigned to different cloud providers to build an efficient, secure, and economical plan for collaborative data processing.", "venue": "2019 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications Workshops (PerCom Workshops)", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2019-03-01", "journal": {"name": "2019 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications Workshops (PerCom Workshops)", "pages": "349-351"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1753172", "name": "Enrico Bacis"}, {"authorId": "144794379", "name": "S.
