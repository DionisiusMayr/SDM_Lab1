Modern memory-intensive workloads have increasing memory bandwidth, latency, and capacity requirements. However, DRAM vendors often prioritize memory capacity scaling over latency and bandwidth [1]\u2013[4]. As a result, main memory is an increasingly worsening bottleneck in computing systems [3,5\u20139].", "venue": "IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-06-01", "journal": {"name": "2022 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI (ISVLSI)", "pages": "267-272"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2048193264", "name": "Ataberk Olgun"}, {"authorId": "1388812849", "name": "Juan G\u00f3mez-Luna"}, {"authorId": "112984718", "name": "Konstantinos Kanellopoulos"}, {"authorId": "36587282", "name": "Behzad Salami"}, {"authorId": "40016363", "name": "Hasan Hassan"}, {"authorId": "144889368", "name": "O.
