This article presents models and algorithms to schedule this type of query in distributed database systems while attempting to strike a balance between makespan and communication costs. We propose three algorithms based on combinatorial optimization methods: the well-known linear relaxation technique of rounding a solution generated by linear programming (LP), a more sophisticated Lagrangian Relaxation method (LR), as well as a greedy heuristic (GR) for baseline comparison. Our evaluation shows that a schedule built using GR consumes, on average, 22% more processing and communication resources than a more elaborate schedule constructed via the LR method, when scheduling a query for 64 machines. The schedule provided by LR is also, on average, an order of magnitude closer to the optimal schedule for a query compared to GR. We show that scheduling Gigabyte-size multiway queries before execution can reduce its processing time by an order of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art frameworks for spatial data processing that do not have this capability, and can significantly reduce the amount of shuffled data in the network.", "venue": "International Journal of Geographical Information Science", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-02-06", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Geographical Information Science", "pages": "1388 - 1419", "volume": "37"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2057955542", "name": "Thiago Borges de Oliveira"}, {"authorId": "145393795", "name": "F.
