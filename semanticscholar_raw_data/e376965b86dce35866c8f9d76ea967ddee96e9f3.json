The healthcare industry is undergoing dramatic transformations at present. One of the most recent industries to heavily use AI is telehealth, which is used for anything from issuing electronic healthcare cards to providing individual counselling. Artificial intelligence (AI) is influencing telehealth in the United States in a major way. Using AI in telehealth to allow clinicians to make real-time, data-driven rich choices is critical to offering a better patient experience and improved health outcomes as practitioners strive toward expanding virtual care options along the care continuum. Research in the medical industry has started to use AI\u2019s strengths in data processing and analysis in telehealth, reflecting the widespread adoption of AI in other sectors. Because of the difficulties inherent in telemedicine\u2019s deployment, there is an urgent need to broaden its capabilities and enhance its processes so that they may be tailored to address particular issues. This article is aimed to study different areas of telemedicine and analyze the effect of AI in the field of health and medicine. The literature surveyed in this study demonstrates the infinite growth potential afforded by the combination of AI and telemedicine. There are four main directions that the expanding use of this technology is heading: patient monitoring, healthcare IT, intelligent aid in diagnosis, and information analysis with other specialists.", "venue": "Sustainability", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-04-14", "journal": {"name": "Sustainability"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "35761934", "name": "Ayesha Amjad"}, {"authorId": "2102418624", "name": "P.
