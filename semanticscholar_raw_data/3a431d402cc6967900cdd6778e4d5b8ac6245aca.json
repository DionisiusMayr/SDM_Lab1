However, in each encoded packet, one element takes part in the encoding only once, so the obtained overhead is extremely high. In this work, based on the idea of multidimensional encoding/modulation, we propose to employ one element of the encoding process multiple times when constructing one encoded packet based on the Cauchy matrix, thereby leveraging the favourable properties of the code based on Cauchy matrix. The overhead is reduced from square to logarithmic in certain parameters. Compared with the overhead of the existing square computational complexity, it is greatly reduced.", "venue": "Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-09-15", "journal": {"name": "Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3100717", "name": "Mingjun Dai"}, {"authorId": "2051690364", "name": "Chanting Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2165142307", "name": "Zhaoyan Hong"}, {"authorId": "2668005", "name": "Pawel Wawrzynski"}, {"authorId": "2211435248", "name": "Tomasz Trzcinski"}, {"authorId": "144591140", "name": "Xiaohui Lin"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "b4bdb1f4e3e6393359f938155c27d8edab08de6e", "title": "Sparse Rev-Shift coded modulation with novel overhead bound"}]}
