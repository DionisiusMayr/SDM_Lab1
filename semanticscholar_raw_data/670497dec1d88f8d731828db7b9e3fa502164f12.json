The major procedures during the process of information resource organization of DL are provided in this article. In the meta data description, the metadata management module in grid middleware is studied, and the technology of semantic association is introduced to design a resource matching algorithm based on semantic association. Then a dynamic solution for reliability scheduling of resources is also put forward. We establish a DL grid environment in the experiment and make simulation tests on the information service model and related research findings. The experiments verify the feasibility of organization model proposed in this article and the performance superiority of improved scheme.", "venue": "", "year": 2016, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "Journal of Residuals Science & Technology", "volume": "13"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2146228174", "name": "Hao Wang"}], "citations": []}
