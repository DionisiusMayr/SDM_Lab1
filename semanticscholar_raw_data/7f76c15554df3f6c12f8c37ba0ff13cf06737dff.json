Changes in Arctic sea ice affect atmospheric circulation,\nocean current, and polar ecosystems. There have been unprecedented decreases\nin the amount of Arctic sea ice due to global warming. In this study, a novel 1-month sea ice concentration (SIC)\nprediction model is proposed, with eight predictors using a deep-learning\napproach, convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This monthly SIC prediction\nmodel based on CNNs is shown to perform better predictions (mean absolute\nerror \u2013 MAE \u2013 of 2.28\u2009%, anomaly correlation coefficient \u2013 ACC \u2013 of 0.98, root-mean-square error \u2013 RMSE \u2013 of 5.76\u2009%, normalized RMSE \u2013 nRMSE \u2013 of 16.15\u2009%,\nand NSE \u2013 Nash\u2013Sutcliffe efficiency \u2013 of 0.97) than a random-forest-based (RF-based) model (MAE of 2.45\u2009%, ACC\nof 0.98, RMSE of 6.61\u2009%, nRMSE of 18.64\u2009%, and NSE of 0.96) and the\npersistence model based on the monthly trend (MAE of 4.31\u2009%, ACC of 0.95,\nRMSE of 10.54\u2009%, nRMSE of 29.17\u2009%, and NSE of 0.89) through hindcast\nvalidations. The spatio-temporal analysis also confirmed the superiority of\nthe CNN model. The CNN model showed good SIC prediction results in extreme\ncases that recorded unforeseen sea ice plummets in 2007 and 2012 with RMSEs of less\nthan 5.0\u2009%. This study also examined the importance of the input\nvariables through a sensitivity analysis. In both the CNN and RF models, the\nvariables of past SICs were identified as the most sensitive factor in\npredicting SICs. For both models, the SIC-related variables generally\ncontributed more to predict SICs over ice-covered areas, while other\nmeteorological and oceanographic variables were more sensitive to the\nprediction of SICs in marginal ice zones. The proposed 1-month SIC\nprediction model provides valuable information which can be used in various\napplications, such as Arctic shipping-route planning, management of the fishing\nindustry, and long-term sea ice forecasting and dynamics.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Environmental Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2020-03-25", "journal": {"name": "The Cryosphere", "pages": "1083-1104", "volume": "14"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2152651140", "name": "Y.
