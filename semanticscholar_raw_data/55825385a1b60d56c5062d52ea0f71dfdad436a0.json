The manufacturer aims at optimizing existing fleets and supporting the development process of future fleet generations. Furthermore, data-driven models have increasing importance in fleet applications. Thus, this paper proposes a concept for a holistic fleet management approach for manufacturers supporting the development process of future fleet generations and services. We build our concept on three layers, one for the manufacturer, the fleet operator, and the machines respectively. We also discuss interactions and information flow in between the layers. Thus, enabling manufacturers to integrate operational data of customers into the development process making the products and services more customer-oriented. Before launching data-driven fleet services extensive training data is required. However, when launching new fleets disadvantageously only little data is available. As solution, we discuss the transfer of machine learning models in between different fleets (inter-fleet transfer learning). This enables quickly launching reliable machine models for new fleets with a lack of data.", "venue": "IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2021-10-17", "journal": {"name": "2021 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)", "pages": "3218-3225"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2139428590", "name": "Friedrich von B\u00fclow"}, {"authorId": "153476800", "name": "F.
