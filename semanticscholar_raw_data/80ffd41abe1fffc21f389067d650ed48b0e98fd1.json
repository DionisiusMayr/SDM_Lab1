We also study the scale of the infrastructure mentioned in DS courses, from small client-server systems to cloud-scale, peer-to-peer, global-scale systems. We make eight main findings, covering goals such as performance, and scalability and its variant elasticity; activities such as performance bench-marking and monitoring; eight selected performance-enhancing techniques (replication, caching, sharding, load balancing, scheduling, streaming, migrating, and offloading); and control issues such as trade-offs that include performance and performance variability.", "venue": "International Conference on Performance Engineering", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book"], "publicationDate": "2021-03-02", "journal": {"name": "Companion of the ACM/SPEC International Conference on Performance Engineering"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2004049", "name": "Cristina L.
