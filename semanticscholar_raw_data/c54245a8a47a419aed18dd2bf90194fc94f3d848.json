Our approach adopts a modified lambda architecture approach, which consists of a knowledge extraction batch processing step and a real time emissions calculation step. The approach makes it possible to automatically identify the berths or ports where emissions are high in a consistent and uniform way across the globe.", "venue": "Global Oceans 2020: Singapore \u2013 U.S. Gulf Coast", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2020-10-05", "journal": {"name": "Global Oceans 2020: Singapore \u2013 U.S. Gulf Coast", "pages": "1-4"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "46440085", "name": "G.
