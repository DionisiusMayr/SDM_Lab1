It includes approx four important areas for analysis and big data, namely (a) survey of big data (b) cloud computing (c) geospatial big data (d) research challenges Through this survey paper, we recognized the possible issues and challenges in cloud computing technology. It refers to spatial datasets which exceed the capacity of the latest computing systems. Big data is referred to as a current emerging field and big challenge for business, innovation, research, and development. This paper also provides a complete review of a big geospatial data analysis through cloud computing and also discusses the challenges and opportunities for research.", "venue": "Social Science Research Network", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2019-03-11", "journal": {"name": "Materials Engineering eJournal"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "107735189", "name": "Alpna Patel"}, {"authorId": "40639997", "name": "A.
