A database management system (DBMS) is an integral part of effectively all software systems, and therefore it is logical that different studies have compared the performance of different DBMSs in hopes of finding the most efficient one. This survey systematically synthesizes the results and approaches of studies that compare DBMS performance and provides recommendations for industry and research. The results show that performance is usually tested in a way that does not reflect real-world use cases, and that tests are typically reported in insufficient detail for replication or for drawing conclusions from the stated results.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2301.01095"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "51302582", "name": "Toni Taipalus"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "24f0720746dc475646a78d7a4cdbb0f836bbac4e", "title": "OpenStack in Higher Education and Academic Research: A Case Study on Benchmarking Big Data Processing Tools"}, {"paperId": "984e7c43f5fceea3fbe3aeed32ee15a8f4d89759", "title": "Framework for the Assessment of Data Masking Performance Penalties in SQL Database Servers.
