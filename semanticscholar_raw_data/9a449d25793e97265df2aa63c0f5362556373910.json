Among these, Twitter and Reddit are two of the most popular. While Twitter users follow and interact with other users (tweets), Reddit users follow and interact with communities known as subreddits. In addition to mainstream social networks, alternative platforms such as Parler exist for users who prefer less moderated online environments. However, there are also malicious users, such as bots and trolls, who exploit social networks for malicious purposes. Therefore, separating malicious behaviors from legitimate ones is crucial. This research aims to evaluate Botometer and RepScope systems to analyze the temporal posting behaviors of Twitter, Reddit, and Parler users and to identify bots, trolls, and malicious behaviors.", "venue": "International Journal of Technology and Human Interaction", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-08-07", "journal": {"name": "Int.
