This algebra is being used as the formal basis of MRQL, which is a query processing and optimization system for large-scale distributed data analysis. The MRQL semantics is given in terms of monoid comprehensions, which support group-by and order-by syntax and can work on heterogeneous collections without requiring any extension to the monoid algebra. We present the syntax and semantics of monoid comprehensions and provide rules to translate them to the monoid algebra. We give evidence of the effectiveness of our algebra by presenting some important optimization rules, such as converting nested queries to joins.", "venue": "Journal of functional programming", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2017-12-11", "journal": {"name": "Journal of Functional Programming", "volume": "27"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1746298", "name": "L.
