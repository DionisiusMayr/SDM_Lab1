Therefore, governments are forced to implements or improve information systems with modern technologies. This research work is focused on the research of responses times on relational and non-relational data base models in an experimental data base system provided by the Funci\u00f3n Judicial del Ecuador. The data is migrated for load in NoSQL allotment, and the performance tests is obtained a document-oriented data model. With these tests we could know the best database, focusing all on response time of data queries that have been used on performance tests. In addition, we evaluate the performance before and after the relational database administration system (RDBMS), obtaining as a result that the first test of the queries made to MongoDB substantially surpass the queries made to SQL Server, but in the subsequent tests the times they tend to be similar.", "venue": "International Conference on eDemocracy & eGovernment", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2018-04-04", "journal": {"name": "2018 International Conference on eDemocracy & eGovernment (ICEDEG)", "pages": "257-262"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2054935588", "name": "Ana Flores"}, {"authorId": "46210054", "name": "S.
