However, the complex process of traffic anomaly is affected by both various static factors and dynamic interactions. The recent evolving representation learning provides a new possibility to understand this complicated process, but with challenges of imbalanced data distribution and heterogeneity of features. To tackle these problems, this paper proposes a spatio-temporal evolution model named SNIPERfor learning intricate feature interactions to predict traffic anomalies. Specifically, we design spatio-temporal encoders to transform spatio-temporal information into vector space indicating their natural relationship. Then, we propose a temporally dynamical evolving embedding method to pay more attention to rare traffic anomalies and develop an effective attention-based multiple graph convolutional network to formulate the spatially mutual influence from three different perspectives. The FC-LSTM is adopted to aggregate the heterogeneous features considering the spatio-temporal influences. Finally, a loss function is designed to overcome the \u2019over-smoothing\u2019 and solve the imbalanced data problem. Extensive experiments show that SNIPER averagely outperforms state-of-the-arts by 3.9%, 0.9%, 1.9% and 1.6% on Chicago datasets, and 2.4%, 0.6%, 2.6% and 1.3% on New York City datasets in metrics of AUC-PR, AUC-ROC, F1 score, and accuracy, respectively.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-05-01", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering", "pages": "5356-5370", "volume": "35"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "40134592", "name": "Xiaoming Liu"}, {"authorId": "2156120236", "name": "Zhanwei Zhang"}, {"authorId": "145225199", "name": "Lingjuan Lyu"}, {"authorId": "2156119744", "name": "Zhaohan Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2114810399", "name": "Shuai Xiao"}, {"authorId": "2154740036", "name": "Chao Shen"}, {"authorId": "2149668064", "name": "P.
