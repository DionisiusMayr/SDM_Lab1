Data clustering is a data mining approach that clusters a huge amount of data into a number of clusters; in other words, it finds symmetric and asymmetric objects. In this study, we developed a novel strategy that uses intelligent optimization algorithms to tackle a group of issues requiring sophisticated methods to solve. Three primary components are employed in the suggested technique, named GNDDMOA: Dwarf Mongoose Optimization Algorithm (DMOA), Generalized Normal Distribution (GNF), and Opposition-based Learning Strategy (OBL). These parts are used to organize the executions of the proposed method during the optimization process based on a unique transition mechanism to address the critical limitations of the original methods. Twenty-three test functions and eight data clustering tasks were utilized to evaluate the performance of the suggested method. The suggested method\u2019s findings were compared to other well-known approaches. In all of the benchmark functions examined, the suggested GNDDMOA approach produced the best results. It performed very well in data clustering applications showing promising performance.", "venue": "Symmetry", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-05-17", "journal": {"name": "Symmetry", "pages": "1021", "volume": "14"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "9166190", "name": "Fahd M.
