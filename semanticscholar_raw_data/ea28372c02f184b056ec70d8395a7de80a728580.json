Industrial setups require SPEs to sustain outages, varying data rates, and low-latency processing. SPEs need to transparently reconfigure stateful queries during runtime. However, state-of-the-art SPEs are not ready yet to handle on-the-fly reconfigurations of queries with terabytes of state due to three problems. These are network overhead for state migration, consistency, and overhead on data processing. In this paper, we propose Rhino, a library for efficient reconfigurations of running queries in the presence of very large distributed state. Rhino provides a handover protocol and a state migration protocol to consistently and efficiently migrate stream processing among servers. Overall, our evaluation shows that Rhino scales with state sizes of up to TBs, reconfigures a running query 15 times faster than the state-of-the-art, and reduces latency by three orders of magnitude upon a reconfiguration.", "venue": "Lernen, Wissen, Daten, Analysen", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-05-29", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 2020 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3493800", "name": "Bonaventura Del Monte"}, {"authorId": "2360768", "name": "Steffen Zeuch"}, {"authorId": "1731210", "name": "T.
