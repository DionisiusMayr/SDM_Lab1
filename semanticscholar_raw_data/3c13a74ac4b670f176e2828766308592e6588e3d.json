In order to ensure the safe operation of the power grid, a power intrusion protection system based on edge computing node architecture is proposed. This system is divided into multiple subsystems, and edge node detectors are added to each subsystem to collect and detect power data. By using deep learning, a CNN-LSTM model detector is constructed to extract data features and achieve efficient detection of power intrusions. Test results show that this system can achieve efficient intrusion detection with relatively low memory consumption, effectively reducing the risk of network attacks on the power system, and playing a crucial role in ensuring the safe operation of the power system.", "venue": "ICCSIE", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-09-22", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Cyber Security and Information Engineering"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2248178861", "name": "Hao Xu"}, {"authorId": "2276799584", "name": "Haoning Chen"}, {"authorId": "2248130239", "name": "Ying Nie"}, {"authorId": "2276663731", "name": "Yilin Li"}], "citations": []}
