They fall short, however, in end-to-end workloads, as existing compiler toolchains are too expensive for use with short-running queries. In this work, we define and evaluate a runtime-suitable query compilation pipeline for NVIDIA GPUs that extracts high performance with only minimal optimization. In particular, our balanced approach successfully trades minor slowdowns in execution for major speedups in compilation, even as data sizes increase. We demonstrate performance benefits compared to both CPU and GPU database systems using interpreters and compilers, extending query compilation for GPUs beyond cached use cases.", "venue": "ACM Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization (TACO)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-06-09", "journal": {"name": "ACM Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization", "pages": "1 - 25", "volume": "20"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "40482152", "name": "Alexander Krolik"}, {"authorId": "1698796", "name": "Clark Verbrugge"}, {"authorId": "1699786", "name": "L.
