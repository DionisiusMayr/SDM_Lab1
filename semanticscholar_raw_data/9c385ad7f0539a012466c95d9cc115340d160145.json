However, low-power and energy-e\ufb03cient strategies to e\ufb00ectively monitor and adjust the \ufb02ow rates of FBs are great challenges. Here, a liquid metal based thin-\ufb01lm and self-powered triboelectric sensor (LM-TS) to monitor and adjust the real-time electrolyte \ufb02ow rates in FBs is developed. By integrating the LM-TS with a peristaltic pump (\ufb02ow rate control unit in FB), the \ufb02ow rates of electrolytes can be converted into readable electrical output signals. Furthermore, a logical and a control module are adopted to adjust the \ufb02ow rates of electrolytes automatically after receiving those electrical signals, which are available to guarantee the optimal working condition of FBs. Bene\ufb01ting from the high conductivity and outstanding ductility of ultrathin LM \ufb01lm, the self-powered LM-TS is endowed with high sensitivity, short response time (9.1 ms), and remarkable cyclic stability ( > 20000 cycles) without a\ufb00ecting the normal operation of FBs. This is the \ufb01rst prototype of self-powered adjustment sensor for FBs, which is readily extended to scaled-up FB equipment for intermediate trial and large-scale energy-storage demonstration.", "venue": "Advanced Energy Materials", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-06-13", "journal": {"name": "Advanced Energy Materials"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2115569233", "name": "Yifei Wang"}, {"authorId": "1884785578", "name": "Zhizhao Xu"}, {"authorId": "2181177716", "name": "Ran Cao"}, {"authorId": "2112721054", "name": "Yao Xiong"}, {"authorId": "1477935142", "name": "Jiahong Yang"}, {"authorId": "47869874", "name": "Yanqiang Lei"}, {"authorId": "3554173", "name": "Mei Ding"}, {"authorId": "3604008", "name": "Chuankun Jia"}, {"authorId": "2145029518", "name": "Zhongqiang Wang"}, {"authorId": "14459723", "name": "Qijun Sun"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "fa01e517f7823e4b7b361861d15a303c27f2a6e7", "title": "Pursuing Superhydrophobic Flexible Strain Sensors: From Design to Applications"}, {"paperId": "e3a26ebf0e02d609636d9b63555d4658e555e1c8", "title": "Broad detection range of flexible capacitive sensor with 3D printed interwoven hollow dual-structured dielectric layer"}, {"paperId": "5e50195c91f6cd5a0d3e6bf2a9fa1cfbae4caa35", "title": "Tribotronic Vertical Field\u2010Effect Transistor Based on van der Waals Heterostructures"}, {"paperId": "4732c8a767c575f35399bdd4e868409f4242158f", "title": "Liquid metal-based triboelectric nanogenerators for energy harvesting and emerging applications"}]}
