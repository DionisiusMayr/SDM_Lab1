Meanwhile, as the value of data is increasingly recognized and monetized, concerns about securing valuable data and risks to individual privacy have been growing. Consequently, rigorous data management has emerged as a key requirement in enterprise settings. How will these trends (ML growing popularity, and stricter data governance) intersect? What are the unmet requirements for applying ML in enterprise settings? What are the technical challenges for the DB community to solve? In this paper, we present our vision of how ML and database systems are likely to come together, and early steps we take towards making this vision a reality.", "venue": "Conference on Innovative Data Systems Research", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2019-08-30", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/1909.00084"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "9490513", "name": "Ashvin Agrawal"}, {"authorId": "1383150300", "name": "Rony Chatterjee"}, {"authorId": "1692732", "name": "C.
