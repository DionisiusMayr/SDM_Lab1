{"paperId": "c025fc9365111ca0c7b7ed00b01410a9ed5fe24b", "publicationVenue": null, "title": "Metaverse Security and Privacy: An Overview", "abstract": "Metaverse is a living space and cyberspace that realizes the process of virtualizing and digitizing the real world. It integrates a plethora of existing technologies with the goal of being able to map the real world, even beyond the real world. Metaverse has a bright future and is expected to have many applications in various scenarios. The support of the Metaverse is based on numerous related technologies becoming mature. Hence, there is no doubt that the security risks of the development of the Metaverse may be more prominent and more complex. We present some Metaverse-related technologies and some potential security and privacy issues in the Metaverse. We present current solutions for Metaverse security and privacy derived from these technologies. In addition, we also raise some unresolved questions about the potential Metaverse. To summarize, this survey provides an in-depth review of the security and privacy issues raised by key technologies in Metaverse applications. We hope that this survey will provide insightful research directions and prospects for the Metaverse's development, particularly in terms of security and privacy protection in the Metaverse.",
