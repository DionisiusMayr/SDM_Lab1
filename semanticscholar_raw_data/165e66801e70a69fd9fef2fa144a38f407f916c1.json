Enterprises are moving from massive data to quick data; therefore, they will need to use and maybe extend the latest innovative technologies for real-time stream processing. To serve this purpose the paper surveys and classifies the existing streaming data algorithms and techniques. It presents a categorization of existing recent data streaming algorithms that solve the well-known concept drift research problem. In addition, it lists the various datasets used for the purpose of validation. Finally, it highlights the remaining open research inquiries in this field.", "venue": "2019 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Knowledge Economy (ICCIKE)", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2019-12-01", "journal": {"name": "2019 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Knowledge Economy (ICCIKE)", "pages": "246-250"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "9627285", "name": "Alramzana Nujum Navaz"}, {"authorId": "1941697", "name": "S.
