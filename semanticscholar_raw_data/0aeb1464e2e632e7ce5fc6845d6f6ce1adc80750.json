A growing number of private companies and public admin-istrations is adopting Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to monitor resources, spaces, activities and events. Ensuring the required levels of quality of service and security is a key aspect in managing a service based on IoT. We introduce Phil\u00b4eas, a joint project between Degetel Belgium and the IRIDIA laboratory of the Universit\u00b4e Libre de Bruxelles to develop a framework to analyze the activity of IoT systems and to identify possible issues via anomaly detection. In this paper we describe our framework, and we present two real cases that have been tackled using this framework.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2288651571", "name": "Alberto Franzin"}, {"authorId": "2093113791", "name": "Rapha\u00ebl Gyory"}, {"authorId": "2289000261", "name": "Jean-Charles Nad\u00b4e"}, {"authorId": "2288397679", "name": "Guillaume Aubert"}, {"authorId": "2288662849", "name": "Georges Klenkle"}, {"authorId": "1775694", "name": "H.
