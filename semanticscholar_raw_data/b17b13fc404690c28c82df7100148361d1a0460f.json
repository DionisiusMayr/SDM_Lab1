The data generated offers the ability to measure, infer and understand environmental indicators, from delicate ecologies and natural resources to urban environments. This can be achieved through the analysis of the heterogeneous data sources (structured and unstructured). In this paper, we propose a distributed framework \u2013 Event STream Processing Engine for Environmental Monitoring Domain (ESTemd) for the application of stream processing on heterogeneous environmental data. Our work in this area demonstrates the useful role big data techniques can play in an environmental decision support system, early warning and forecasting systems. The proposed framework addresses the challenges of data heterogeneity from heterogeneous systems and offers real-time processing of huge environmental datasets through a publish/subscribe method via a unified data pipeline with the application of Apache Kafka for real-time analytics.", "venue": "International Conference on Big Data Research", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2020-11-27", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Big Data Research"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "20525056", "name": "Adeyinka K.
