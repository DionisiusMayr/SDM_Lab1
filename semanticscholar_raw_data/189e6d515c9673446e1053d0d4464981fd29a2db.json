In this paper, we present a Big Data architecture supporting typical cultural heritage applications. On the top of querying, browsing, and analyzing cultural contents coming from distributed and heterogeneous repositories, we propose a novel user-centered recommendation strategy for cultural items suggestion. Despite centralizing the processing operations within the cloud, the vision of edge intelligence has been exploited by having a mobile app (Smart Search Museum) to perform semantic searches and machine-learning-based inference so as to be capable of suggesting museums, together with other items of interest, to users when they are visiting a city, exploiting jointly recommendation techniques and edge artificial intelligence facilities. Experimental results on accuracy and user satisfaction show the goodness of the proposed application.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2019-03-28", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics", "pages": "4266-4275", "volume": "15"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "50821858", "name": "Xin Su"}, {"authorId": "2682488", "name": "Giancarlo Sperl\u00ed"}, {"authorId": "1707400", "name": "V.
