Dist-$\\mu$-RA builds on the recursive relational algebra and extends it with evaluation plans suited for the distributed setting. The goal is to offer expressivity for high-level queries while providing efficiency at scale and reducing communication costs. Experimental results on both real and synthetic graphs show the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to existing systems.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-11-24", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2111.12487"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "150293437", "name": "Sarah Chlyah"}, {"authorId": "1768207", "name": "P.
