Our system employs a two-branch fusion method for vehicle image and tracking sensor data, leveraging the strengths of residual structures and identity mapping to enhance agent training. Through comprehensive comparisons, we demonstrate the efficacy of information fusion and establish the superiority of our selected algorithm over alternative approaches. Our work advances the field of autonomous driving and demonstrates the potential of reinforcement learning in enabling intelligent vehicle decision-making.", "venue": "International Conference on Robotics and Mechatronics", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Engineering"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-12-19", "journal": {"name": "2023 11th RSI International Conference on Robotics and Mechatronics (ICRoM)", "pages": "265-270"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2276611498", "name": "Amin Jalal Aghdasian"}, {"authorId": "2276610714", "name": "Amirhossein Heydarian Ardakani"}, {"authorId": "2276611558", "name": "Kianoush Aqabakee"}, {"authorId": "144984370", "name": "F.
