With the rapid developing of city, more and more pipelines like power lines will move into underground. Facing the complex environment from underground and relationship with other kinds of pipeline, the data quality evaluation is very crucial for academic and business applications. This paper introduced our praxis on underground pipeline data quality on a real project. The datasets are mainly composing of vector data about 15 GB size, covers 3 counties, worked with 3 teams. The workflow, data sampling method and quality evaluation method were engaged in our work. This work can extend to other underground pipeline projects or similar spatial data quality evaluation projects.", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2107668020", "name": "H.
