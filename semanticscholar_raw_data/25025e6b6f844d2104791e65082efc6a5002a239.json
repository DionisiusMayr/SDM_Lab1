Our algorithms are deterministic, apply to arbitrary-degree trees and work in the low-space MPC model, where local memory is $O(n^\\delta)$ for $\\delta \\in (0,1)$ and global memory is $O(m)$. Our main result is the 3-coloring algorithm, which contrasts the randomized, state-of-the-art 4-coloring algorithm of Ghaffari, Grunau and Jin [DISC'20]. The maximal independent set and maximal matching algorithms follow in $O(1)$ time after obtaining the coloring. The key ingredient of our 3-coloring algorithm is an $O(\\log^2 \\log n)$ time adaptation of the rake-and-compress tree decomposition used by Chang and Pettie [FOCS'17], and established by Miller and Reif. When restricting our attention to trees of constant degree, we bring the runtime down to $O(\\log \\log n)$.", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2021-05-28", "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "101136989", "name": "R.
