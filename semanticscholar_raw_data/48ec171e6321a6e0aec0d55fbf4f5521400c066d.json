In this paper, we concentrate on uncertain time series data clustering, in which the uncertain values at time points are represented by probability density function. We propose a hybrid clustering approach for uncertain time series. Our clustering approach first partitions the uncertain time series data into a set of micro-clusters and then merges the micro-clusters following the idea of hierarchical clustering. We evaluate our approach with experiments. The experimental results show that, compared with the traditional UK-means clustering algorithm, the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) of our clustering results have an obviously higher accuracy. In addition, the time efficiency of our clustering approach is significantly improved.", "venue": "Journal of computer & information technology", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-10-21", "journal": {"name": "J.
