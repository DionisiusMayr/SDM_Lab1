These compute- and memory-constrained parallel architectures need to run efficiently a wide range of algorithms, including key Non-neural ML kernels that compete favorably with Deep Neural Networks in terms of accuracy under severe resource constraints. In this article, we focus on enabling efficient parallel execution of Non-neural ML algorithms on two RISCV-based PULP platforms, namely, GAP8, a commercial chip, and PULP-OPEN, a research platform running on an FPGA emulator. We optimized the parallel algorithms through a fine-grained analysis and intensive optimization to maximize the speedup, considering two alternative Floating-point (FP) emulation libraries on GAP8 and the native FPU support on PULP-OPEN. Experimental results show that a target-optimized emulation library can lead to an average 1.61\u00d7 runtime improvement and 37% energy reduction compared to a standard emulation library, while the native FPU support reaches up to 32.09\u00d7 and 99%, respectively. In terms of parallel speedup, our design improves the sequential execution by 7.04\u00d7 on average on the targeted octa-core platforms leading to energy and latency decrease up to 87%. Last, we present a comparison with the ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller, a widely adopted commercial solution for edge deployments, which is 12.87\u00d7 slower than PULP-OPEN.", "venue": "ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Engineering"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-07-16", "journal": {"name": "ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems", "pages": "1 - 33", "volume": "22"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1854419868", "name": "Enrico Tabanelli"}, {"authorId": "2107962", "name": "Giuseppe Tagliavini"}, {"authorId": "1710649", "name": "L.
