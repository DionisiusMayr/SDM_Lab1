This paper presents a development and implementation of a predictive maintenance platform based on the cyber-physical system under the Industry 4.0 architecture. The predictive maintenance platform is targeted at products from manufacturing big data to cloud computing, and predictive maintenance for all factories around the world. In the experiments, we implement and discuss the predictive maintenance platform with generated synthetic data and real world data collected from a gearbox plant.", "venue": "Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2019-05-01", "journal": {"name": "2019 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Cyber Physical Systems (ICPS)", "pages": "331-335"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "65783251", "name": "Fang-Ning Yang"}, {"authorId": "8422309", "name": "H.
