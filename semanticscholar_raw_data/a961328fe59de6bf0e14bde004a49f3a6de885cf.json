The manuscript used transfer-learning strategies to landslide susceptibility assessment (LAS) for 10 different cases in Austria, Ecuador, and Italy. Application of various learning based algorithms are interesting topics in LSA, but regarding the existed literatures needs to be polished properly.", "venue": "", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2286881032", "name": "Jason Goetz"}], "citations": []}
