Most prior implementations of data provenance have involved heavyweight modifications to database systems and little attention has been paid to how the provenance data can be used outside such a system. We present extensions to the Links programming language that build on its support for language-integrated query to support provenance queries by rewriting and normalizing monadic comprehensions and extending the type system to distinguish provenance metadata from normal data. The main contribution of this paper is to show that the two most common forms of provenance can be implemented efficiently and used safely as a programming language feature with no changes to the database system.", "venue": "ACM-SIGPLAN International Conference on Principles and Practice of Declarative Programming", "year": 2016, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book"], "publicationDate": "2016-07-14", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 18th International Symposium on Principles and Practice of Declarative Programming"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "31538148", "name": "Stefan Fehrenbach"}, {"authorId": "144320476", "name": "J.
