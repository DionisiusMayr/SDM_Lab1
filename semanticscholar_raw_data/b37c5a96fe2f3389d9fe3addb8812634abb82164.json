Although recent GPUs can over-subscribe memory with Unified Memory (UM), they incur significant overhead when handling graph-structured data. In addition, many popular processing frameworks suffer sub-optimal efficiency due to heavy atomic operations when tracking the active vertices. This article presents Grus, a novel system framework that allows GPU graph processing to stay competitive with the ever-growing graph complexity. Grus improves space efficiency through a UM trimming scheme tailored to the data access behaviors of graph workloads. It also uses a lightweight frontier structure to further reduce atomic operations. With easy-to-use interface that abstracts the above details, Grus shows up to 6.4\u00d7 average speedup over the state-of-the-art in-memory GPU graph processing framework. It allows one to process large graphs of 5.5 billion edges in seconds with a single GPU.", "venue": "ACM Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization (TACO)", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-02-09", "journal": {"name": "ACM Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization (TACO)", "pages": "1 - 25", "volume": "18"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1914624198", "name": "Pengyu Wang"}, {"authorId": "2152447086", "name": "Jing Wang"}, {"authorId": "46651954", "name": "Chao Li"}, {"authorId": "2110245923", "name": "Jianzong Wang"}, {"authorId": "1741879", "name": "Haojin Zhu"}, {"authorId": "1697293", "name": "M.
