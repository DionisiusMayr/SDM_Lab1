Some studies reported changes in platelet and red blood cell (RBC) transfusion requirements in patients who received PR platelets when compared to conventional (CONV) platelets. Over a 28\u2010month period we retrospectively analysed platelet utilisation, RBC transfusion trends, and transfusion reaction rates data from all transfused adult patients transfused at the Yale\u2010New Haven Hospital, New Haven, CT, USA. We determined the number of RBC and platelet components administered between 2 and 24, 48, 72 or 96 h. A total of 3767 patients received 21 907 platelet components (CONV = 8912; PR = 12 995); 1,087 patients received only CONV platelets (1578 components) and 1,466 patients received only PR platelets (2604 components). The number of subsequently transfused platelet components was slightly higher following PR platelet components (P < 0\u00b705); however, fewer RBCs were transfused following PR platelet administration (P < 0\u00b705). The mean time\u2010to\u2010next platelet component transfusion was slightly shorter following PR platelet transfusion (P = 0\u00b7002). The rate of non\u2010septic transfusion reactions did not differ (all P > 0\u00b705). Septic transfusion reactions (N = 5) were seen only after CONV platelet transfusions (P = 0\u00b7011). These results provide evidence for comparable clinical efficacy of PR and CONV platelets. PR platelets eliminated septic transfusion reactions without increased risk of other types of transfusions with only slight increase in platelet utilisation.", "venue": "British Journal of Haematology", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2019-09-30", "journal": {"name": "British Journal of Haematology", "pages": "465 - 472", "volume": "188"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "23475545", "name": "B.
