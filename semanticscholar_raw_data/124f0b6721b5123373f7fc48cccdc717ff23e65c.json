Frequently, these applications have been developed with different technologies and with no concern about integration. Integration platforms are tools that facilitate the development and execution of integration solutions. In this article, we propose a methodology to support software engineers in the decision-making process for an integration platform when performance is a central requirement. The proposed methodology adds objective criteria for performance assessment purposes and has been used to rank the five most popular integration platforms in order to prove its feasibility.", "venue": "Enterprise Information Systems", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2019-06-30", "journal": {"name": "Enterprise Information Systems", "pages": "1292 - 1322", "volume": "13"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1410474076", "name": "Daniela L.
