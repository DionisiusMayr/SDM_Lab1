This procedure is aimed at the timely detection of external damage to the modules, as well as their partial shading. The implementation of these measures solely through visual inspection by the maintenance personnel of the power plant requires significant labor intensity due to the large areas of the generation fields and the operating conditions. Authors propose an approach aimed at increasing the energy efficiency of high-power solar power plants by automating the inspection procedures of the surfaces of photovoltaic modules. The solution is based on the use of an unmanned aerial vehicle with a payload capable of video and geospatial data recording. To perform the procedures for detecting problem modules, it is proposed to use \u201cobject-detection\u201d technology, which uses neural network classification methods characterized by high adaptability to various image parameters. The results of testing the technology showed that the use of a neural network based on the R-CNN architecture with the learning algorithm\u2014Inception v2 (COCO)\u2014allows detecting problematic photovoltaic modules with an accuracy of more than 95% on a clear day.", "venue": "Sustainability", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-09-21", "journal": {"name": "Sustainability"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "100539129", "name": "P.
