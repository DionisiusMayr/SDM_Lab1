With the limited capacity of both communication and computing, how to efficiently schedule the usage of resources in the network toward best utilization represents a fundamental research issue. In this article, we address the issue by jointly considering the communication and computation resources for data scheduling. Specifically, we investigate on the vehicular edge computing (VEC) in which edge computing-enabled roadside unit (RSU) is deployed along the road to provide data bandwidth and computation offloading to vehicles. In addition, vehicles can collaborate among each other with data relays and collaborative computing via vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications. A unified framework with communication, computation, caching, and collaborative computing is then formulated, and a collaborative data scheduling scheme to minimize the system-wide data processing cost with ensured delay constraints of applications is developed. To derive the optimal strategy for data scheduling, we further model the data scheduling as a deep reinforcement learning problem which is solved by an enhanced deep $Q$ -network (DQN) algorithm with a separate target $Q$ -network. Using extensive simulations, we validate the effectiveness of the proposal.", "venue": "IEEE Internet of Things Journal", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-03-26", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Internet of Things Journal", "pages": "9637-9650", "volume": "7"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "48962644", "name": "Quyuan Luo"}, {"authorId": "7431623", "name": "Changle Li"}, {"authorId": "9533837", "name": "T.
