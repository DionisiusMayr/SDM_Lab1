However, the technical issues like anti\u2010forensics, variety of traffic formats, steganography or encrypted data, and real\u2010time live investigation degrades the performance of the cyber forensic framework. Therefore, an effective method named Sunflower Jaya Optimization\u2010based Deep stacked autoencoder (SFJO\u2010based Deep stacked autoencoder) is proposed to perform the cyber forensic framework. The finite element model of Sunflower optimization is integrated with the control parameters of Jaya optimization to solve the issues in the cyber forensic framework. The proposed SFJO\u2010based Deep stacked autoencoder uses the pollination and the peculiar behaviors to enable the cyber forensic framework based on the error value in the big data analytics model. Accordingly, the solution with the minimal value of error is accepted as the best optimal solution by computing the orientation vector. However, the proposed model is illustrated based on the unconstrained benchmark function, which in turn results in the fitness function to reveal the best candidate solution. The proposed SFJO\u2010based Deep stacked autoencoder attained better performance using metrics like precision, sensitivity, and specificity with the values of 0.9053, 0.8865, and 0.8839 using dataset\u20101.", "venue": "International journal of numerical modelling", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2021-05-07", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Numerical Modelling: Electronic Networks", "volume": "34"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2121843074", "name": "Sabaresan Venugopal"}, {"authorId": "1793057", "name": "Godfrey Winster Sathianesan"}, {"authorId": "144651224", "name": "R.
