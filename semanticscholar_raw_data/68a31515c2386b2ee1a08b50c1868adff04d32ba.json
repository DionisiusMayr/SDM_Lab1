The proposed method is based on the integration of environmental sensors, BIM, and VR technology. Such integration provides an opportunity to utilize an immersive and live sensing technology for improving data visualization. In our case study, the environmental data, such as indoor air temperature, humidity, and light level are captured by sensors connected to Arduino microcontrollers. The data output of sensors obtained from Arduino units are stored onto the BIM model and transferred to the developed VR system. The developed system simultaneously visualizes numerical values of sensors\u2019 reading together with the virtual model of the building in a VR headset. The result of the case study showed that the developed system is capable of visualizing various indoor environmental information of the building with the VR technology. It can provide users with useful information to help monitoring indoor thermal comfort conditions of the building in real-time, while performing the walkthrough in the virtual environment.", "venue": "Proceedings of the 24th Conference on Computer Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia (CAADRIA) [Volume 2]", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 24th Conference on Computer Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia (CAADRIA) [Volume 2]"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "102106806", "name": "Worawan Natephra"}, {"authorId": "1857161", "name": "A.
