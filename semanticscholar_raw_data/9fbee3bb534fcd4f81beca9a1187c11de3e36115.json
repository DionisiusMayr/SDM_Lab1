Nowadays, older adults are more likely to have these ailments. People who have this illness have very poor memories and decreased memory. Additionally, their brain isn't working correctly. As a result, their regular practice is progressively beginning to decline. Alzheimer's is a kind of dementia for which there is no definitive treatment. This essay will help us learn more about Alzheimer's illness. We shall learn more about its causes, symptoms, and remedies. Additionally, we investigate several illness prediction methods employing Graph Neural Networks denoted as GNNs. Decision Tree, Random Forest algorithms, and more. However, the Random forest classifier gave good results with 86% accuracy and good recall values.", "venue": "2024 International Conference on Intelligent and Innovative Technologies in Computing, Electrical and Electronics (IITCEE)", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2024-01-24", "journal": {"name": "2024 International Conference on Intelligent and Innovative Technologies in Computing, Electrical and Electronics (IITCEE)", "pages": "1-5"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2275507487", "name": "S.
