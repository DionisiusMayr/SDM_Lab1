The 5G network has great potential to contribute significantly to the achievement of SDG8, offering faster and more reliable connectivity, which opens up new possibilities for innovation, operational efficiency, and job creation. The present study aimed to investigate the role of 5G technologies concerning decent work and economic growth (SDG8). As part of the method, 265 articles extracted from main databases such as Scopus, IEEExplore, and ScienceDirect were analyzed using the PRISMA methodology, resulting in 74 relevant articles after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. As a result, a greater contribution to the use of the 5G network was identified in sectors such as manufacturing, health, and transportation, generating greater economic growth and job creation. It was also found that the technological applications with the greatest contributions are \u201cInternet of Things\u201d and \u201cArtificial intelligence\u201d. Finally, it was concluded that the results of this review are useful for future research on technologies that support 5G networks, contributing to economic growth and equitable and sustainable decent work in a wide range of sectors and rural areas.", "venue": "Sustainability", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-11-09", "journal": {"name": "Sustainability"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2174906414", "name": "Saul Beltozar-Clemente"}, {"authorId": "2139807582", "name": "Orlando Iparraguirre-Villanueva"}, {"authorId": "2266576630", "name": "F\u00e9lix Pucuhuayla-Revatta"}, {"authorId": "2156869176", "name": "Fernando Sierra-Li\u00f1an"}, {"authorId": "1491177485", "name": "Joselyn Zapata-Paulini"}, {"authorId": "1491176516", "name": "M.
