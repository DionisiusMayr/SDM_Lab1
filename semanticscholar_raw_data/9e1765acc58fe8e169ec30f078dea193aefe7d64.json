This condition often occurs in companies or higher education organizations in managing academic data. This condition can be improved by optimizing the database server by integrating relational databases with column-oriented databases to speed up query responses and save development costs. Based on the experiments that had been carried out, column-oriented has succeeded in optimizing with a significant difference in query execution time and the server does not crash.", "venue": "Journal of Intelligent Software Systems", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-12-31", "journal": {"name": "Journal of Intelligent Software Systems"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2123964387", "name": "Bagas Triaji"}, {"authorId": "100509592", "name": "W.
