In this paper, we propose DAP-Walk, a novel approach for instance matching that is based on a dynamic and affinity-preserving Markov random walk. Our approach takes into account the local and global information mutually calculated from an association graph of candidate pairs of co-referents. Precisely, we leverage this graph to rank each candidate pair through the stationary distribution computed from the random walk on the association graph. We provide a scalable Spark-based implementation for DAP-Walk where the ranking of nodes of candidate co-referents is obtained by aggregating the distributed ranks calculated across spark workers. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show the efficiency and scalability of DAP-Walk compared to several state-of-the-art instance matching approaches.", "venue": "2020 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2020-12-10", "journal": {"name": "2020 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "pages": "892-897"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1505577159", "name": "A.
