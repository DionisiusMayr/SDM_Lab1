Initially the classification analysis through the Matlab R2021a software, identified an Accuracy of 81.3%, for the Ensemble Bagged Trees algorithm. When performing the validation of the collected data, and proceeding with the obtaining of the predictive model, for the 4 classes (satisfaction levels), total precision values of 82.21%, Sensitivity of 73.40%, Specificity of 91.02% and of 90.63% Accuracy. In turn, the highest level of the area under the curve (AUC) by means of the Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) is 0.93, thus considering a sensitivity of the predictive model of 93%. The validation of these results will allow the directors of the higher institution to have a database, to be used in the process of improving the quality of the educational service in relation to teaching performance.
