There is a niche for developing new algorithms, and visualisation and decision support tools to assist health professionals in chronic disease management incorporating data generated through smart sensors in a more precise and personalised manner. However, current understanding of risk models relies on static snapshots of health variables or measures, rather than ongoing and dynamic feedback loops of behaviour, considering changes and different states of patients and diseases. The rationale of this work is to introduce a new method for discovering dynamic risk models for chronic diseases, based on patients\u2019 dynamic behaviour provided by health sensors, using Process Mining techniques. Results show the viability of this method, three dynamic models have been discovered for the chronic diseases hypertension, obesity, and diabetes, based on the dynamic behaviour of metabolic risk factors associated. This information would support health professionals to translate a one-fits-all current approach to treatments and care, to a personalised medicine strategy, that fits treatments built on patients\u2019 unique behaviour thanks to dynamic risk modelling taking advantage of the amount data generated by smart sensors.", "venue": "Italian National Conference on Sensors", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-09-01", "journal": {"name": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "volume": "20"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1417632409", "name": "Zoe Valero-Ramon"}, {"authorId": "1403054624", "name": "C.
