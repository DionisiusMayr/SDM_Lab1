Join order optimization, for example, considers only left-deep plans, and selects the join order using a greedy algorithm. Instead of continuing to patch the MySQL optimizer, why not delegate optimization of more complex queries to another more capable optimizer? This paper reports on our experience with integrating the Orca optimizer into MySQL. Orca is an extensible open-source query optimizer\u2014originally used by Pivotal\u2019s Greenplum DBMS\u2014specifically designed for demanding analytical workloads. Queries submitted to MySQL are routed to Orca for optimization, and the resulting plans are returned to MySQL for execution. Metadata and statistical information needed during optimization is retrieved from MySQL\u2019s data dictionary. Experimental results show substantial performance gains. On the TPC-DS benchmark, Orca\u2019s plans were over 10X faster on 10 of the 99 queries, and over 100X faster on 3 queries.", "venue": "International Conference on Extending Database Technology", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"pages": "2:511-2:523"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2018796", "name": "A.
