In this paper, we present a case study in the application of machine learning for predictive maintenance in a manufacturing management setting. Through the implementation of various algorithms such as random forests, gradient boosting, and deep learning, we show that machine learning can provide significant improvements in the accuracy of predicting equipment failures. The results of our study demonstrate that predictive maintenance using machine learning can reduce downtime and maintenance costs, while improving the overall efficiency of manufacturing operations. The findings of this case study can provide valuable insights for manufacturers looking to adopt predictive maintenance strategies and incorporate machine learning into their maintenance management processes.", "venue": "2023 3rd International Conference on Advance Computing and Innovative Technologies in Engineering (ICACITE)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-05-12", "journal": {"name": "2023 3rd International Conference on Advance Computing and Innovative Technologies in Engineering (ICACITE)", "pages": "872-876"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2224772816", "name": "Deepanshu Singh Satwaliya"}, {"authorId": "9284539", "name": "H.
