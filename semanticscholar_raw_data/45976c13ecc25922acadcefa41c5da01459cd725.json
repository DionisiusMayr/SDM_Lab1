Traditional methods focus on static MV management, which assumes that MVs will not be added or evicted. However, in real scenarios, query workloads usually dynamically change, and thereby the previously maintained MVs cannot be well adapted to future workloads due to the possible shift in query distribution. Therefore, it is important to study the dynamic MV management problem where workloads dynamically change, but there are several challenges. First, it is challenging to estimate the bene\ufb01t of using an MV to answer a query (i.e., the execution time reduction of answering the query using the view) in order to select high-quality MVs, especially for dynamic workloads, where queries and MVs dynamically change. Second, it is challenging to ef\ufb01ciently maintain the set of MVs to immediately utilize the new views to answer the newly coming queries. However, existing methods either have low accuracy (traditional methods) or low ef\ufb01ciency (learning-based methods). To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework GnnMV that leverages the graph neural network (GNN) to estimate the bene\ufb01t for ef\ufb01cient and effective dynamic MVs management. First, we maintain the dynamic query workloads as a query graph, extract and encode key features of queries to model a GNN. Second, we design a feature aggregation function for neighbor nodes in the graph to achieve high accuracy. Third, we propose to extract a small subgraph for ef\ufb01cient bene\ufb01t estimation, when the graph becomes larger and larger due to continuously coming queries. Experimental results show that our method signi\ufb01cantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.", "venue": "", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2112897213", "name": "Yue Han"}, {"authorId": "1720852203", "name": "Chengliang Chai"}, {"authorId": "2180333808", "name": "Jiabin Liu"}, {"authorId": "2242412700", "name": "Guoliang Li"}, {"authorId": "2111631833", "name": "Chuangxian Wei"}, {"authorId": "1943446516", "name": "Chaoqun Zhan"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "759ef231abd73632dc91f73ae467c3d3bf314deb", "title": "PERBANDINGAN PERFORMA QUERY SELECT DASAR, VIEW, DAN STORED PROCEDURE PADA DATABASE MYSQL"}, {"paperId": "6c4939564ba3d47fd4e54ff6084128f21ddb8037", "title": "AutoCE: An Accurate and Efficient Model Advisor for Learned Cardinality Estimation"}]}
