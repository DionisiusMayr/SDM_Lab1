On the other hand, artificial intelligence technology is gradually promoting the intelligent development of various industries. As two promising technologies today, there is a natural advantage in the convergence between blockchain and artificial intelligence technologies. Blockchain makes artificial intelligence more autonomous and credible, and artificial intelligence can prompt blockchain toward intelligence. In this paper, we analyze the combination of blockchain and artificial intelligence from a more comprehensive and three-dimensional point of view. We first introduce the background of artificial intelligence and the concept, characteristics, and key technologies of blockchain and subsequently analyze the feasibility of combining blockchain with artificial intelligence. Next, we summarize the research work on the convergence of blockchain and artificial intelligence in home and overseas within this category. After that, we list some related application scenarios about the convergence of both technologies and also point out existing problems and challenges. Finally, we discuss the future work.", "venue": "Secur. Commun.
