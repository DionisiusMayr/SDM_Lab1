Geographic Information Systems (GIS) have long served as pivotal tools for mapping and understanding spatial relationships. However, the dawn of Web 3.0 technologies has catalyzed a transformative shift in the geospatial domain. This research meticulously inves - tigates this transformation, focusing on the integration of decentralized spatial data storage, blockchain, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning (ML) with traditional GIS frameworks. Decentralized systems, un - derpinned by the principles of Web 3.0, present a promising alternative to centralized data storage, addressing challenges related to scalability, data sovereignty, and system vulnerabilities. Blockchain technology, traditionally associated with financial transactions, emerges as a cornerstone in this new GIS paradigm, ensuring unparalleled data integrity, transparency, and security. Its decentralized ledger system, combined with consensus mechanisms, offers a robust and transparent framework for managing diverse spatial data - sets, ranging from land registries to intricate environmental monitoring systems. The incorporation of AI and ML technologies further augments the capabilities of GIS. Beyond mere visualization, GIS, when powered by AI and ML, can process vast datasets, discern complex patterns, and even predict future spatial trends with remarkable accuracy. This research emphasizes the role of real-time and dynamic queries, highlighting the transition from static GIS analyses to more adaptive and predictive geospatial evaluations. While the potential advantages of this technological convergence are substantial, the research also sheds light on inherent challenges, especially those related to the management of high-volume real-time data and ensuring data consistency across diverse sources. Building upon foundational works in the field, this study offers a holistic and comprehensive perspective on the synergistic potential of Web 3.0 technologies, AI, ML, and blockchain within GIS. It not only extends the findings of prior research but also paves the way for future explorations, setting the stage for innovative advancements in geospatial analysis.", "venue": "", "year": null, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2277946844", "name": "Arsenii O.
