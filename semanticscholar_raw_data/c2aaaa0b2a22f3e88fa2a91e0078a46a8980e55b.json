However, with the increasing interconnection of machines, not only the volume but also the variety of data is being expanded. The data life cycles of collection, processing, combining, analyzing and feeding new findings back into sources are becoming increasingly challenging for data scientists to complete. Reference architectures such as the RAMI 4.0 provide conceptual guidelines to address these problems. In this paper, we focus on the implementation of an agent-based architecture that is in line with RAMI 4.0. This architecture implements the guidelines provided by RAMI 4.0 by applying modern approaches from the areas of data lake based data acquisition, semantic description, look up and processing as well as information utilization.", "venue": "International Symposium on High Performance Computing Systems and Applications", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2019-07-01", "journal": {"name": "2019 International Conference on High Performance Computing & Simulation (HPCS)", "pages": "961-968"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "40987903", "name": "Andreas Kirmse"}, {"authorId": "40992071", "name": "Vadim Kraus"}, {"authorId": "41077735", "name": "Tristan Langer"}, {"authorId": "29814683", "name": "Andr\u00e9 Pomp"}, {"authorId": "2661383", "name": "Tobias Meisen"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "663af58eeb9e6121979f0e31f4dfeee0cb68b0ef", "title": "Industrial Data Pipelines for Manufacturing Applications"}]}
