Today's market has a large number of software products that haven't been properly tested before being released. In order to obtain a software system free from flaws, it tends to discover any bugs that may be present in the software while running the programs. There are two different forms of testing: manual testing and automated testing. A variety of automated tools available on the market are the center of automation testing. This proposed study sheds light on Ranorex, one such automated testing tool. It offers an evaluation of the testing tool's features, taking into account the tool's potential, popularity, and usability. Additionally, this study examines the benefits and downsides of various testing methods as well as the advantages Ranorex has over all other testing tools on the market. We will also briefly compare the two testing tools, Ranorex and Selenium.", "venue": "2023 3rd International Conference on Innovative Sustainable Computational Technologies (CISCT)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-09-08", "journal": {"name": "2023 3rd International Conference on Innovative Sustainable Computational Technologies (CISCT)", "pages": "1-5"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "107926653", "name": "S.
