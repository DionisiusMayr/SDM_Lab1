IBD is highly complex and associated with significant variation in care and outcomes. The application of AI to IBD has the potential to reduce variation in healthcare delivery and improve quality of care. AI refers to the ability of machines to mimic human intelligence. The range of AI's ability to perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence varies from prediction to complex decision\u2010making that more closely resembles human thought. Clinical applications of AI have been applied to study pathogenesis, diagnosis, and patient prognosis in IBD. Despite these advancements, AI in IBD is in its early development and has tremendous potential to transform future care.", "venue": "Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2021-02-01", "journal": {"name": "Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology", "pages": "279 - 285", "volume": "36"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1400933586", "name": "S.
