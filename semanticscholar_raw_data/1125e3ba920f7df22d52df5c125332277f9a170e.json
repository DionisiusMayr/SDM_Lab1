This implies showing the schema-level patterns instantiated in the graph, but also the terms used to qualify its entities. In this article, we present a new profiling tool that we call TTprofiler. It shows the predicates that relate types in the KG, and also the terms present in this KG, because of their paramount importance in most KGs, especially in the Cultural Heritage (CH) domain. We recall the role of terminologies and how they are implemented and used on the Web, we give the algorithm for building a TT profile from an online KG\u2019s endpoint, and we report on experiments performed over a set of Cultural Heritage Web KGs. A tool for visualizing TT profiles is also provided.", "venue": "ACM Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-03-18", "journal": {"name": "ACM Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage", "pages": "1 - 22", "volume": "16"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "46585378", "name": "Lamine Diop"}, {"authorId": "69946241", "name": "B.
