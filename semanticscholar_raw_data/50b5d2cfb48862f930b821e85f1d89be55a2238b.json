However, the current learned indexes assume the data distribution is relatively static and the access pattern is uniform, while real-world scenarios consist of skew query distribution and evolving data. In this paper, we demonstrate that the missing consideration of access patterns and dynamic data distribution notably hinders the applicability of learned indexes. To this end, we propose solutions for learned indexes for dynamic workloads (called Doraemon). To improve the latency for skew queries, Doraemon augments the training data with access frequencies. To address the slow model re-training when data distribution shifts, Doraemon caches the previously-trained models and incrementally fine-tunes them for similar access patterns and data distribution. Our preliminary result shows that, Doraemon improves the query latency by 45.1% and reduces the model re-training time to 1/20.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2019-02-02", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/1902.00655"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "41211459", "name": "Chuzhe Tang"}, {"authorId": "1508399092", "name": "Zhiyuan Dong"}, {"authorId": "2136369359", "name": "Minjie Wang"}, {"authorId": "8491577", "name": "Zhaoguo Wang"}, {"authorId": "2118438836", "name": "Haibo Chen"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "ac0270e7af0b2b013156c888050be082c673c3cf", "title": "A Survey of Learned Indexes for the Multi-dimensional Space"}, {"paperId": "bf5d9e92e921a945d3e6652dc786c3c7d96988ae", "title": "Testing the Robustness of Learned Index Structures"}, {"paperId": "35d13a1a51e2915d317c299fa34c108296e078d6", "title": "A survey on AI for storage"}, {"paperId": "66267237ad17584da4ff67c162ad7003e85e6737", "title": "Workload-Aware Performance Tuning for Autonomous DBMSs"}, {"paperId": "4c025d948d6234a01f9ea5573138db8e7dd4bef2", "title": "A Tutorial on Learned Multi-dimensional Indexes"}, {"paperId": "638766b215dc7b2bd946a0e69e8914a9bbb04ae7", "title": "The Price of Tailoring the Index to Your Data: Poisoning Attacks on Learned Index Structures"}, {"paperId": "d3077a722238fe2b7b717d88549ed81252eff456", "title": "Database Meets AI: A Survey"}]}
