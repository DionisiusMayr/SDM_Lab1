Description of architectural solutions for the system under development, review of potential technologies used and justification of technological stack choice are performed. The process of implementing the distributed monitoring system, as well as the developed functionality is described and demonstrates the results of testing the main operating scenarios.", "venue": "2023 Systems of Signals Generating and Processing in the Field of on Board Communications", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-03-14", "journal": {"name": "2023 Systems of Signals Generating and Processing in the Field of on Board Communications", "pages": "1-8"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "118069056", "name": "K.
