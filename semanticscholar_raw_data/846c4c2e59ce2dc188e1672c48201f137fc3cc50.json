Because of the dramatically improved speed at which it processes data, it can be applied to various issues. QC has many potential applications, but three of the most exciting applications are unstructured search, quantum simulation, and network optimisation. Several existing technologies, such as machine learning, may benefit from its increased speed and precision. In this study, the authors will explore how the principles of QC might be applied to the Internet of Things (IoT) to improve its accuracy, speed, and security. Several approaches exist for achieving this goal, such as network optimisation in IoT using QC, faster computation at IoT endpoints, securing IoT using QC, a quantum sensor for IoT, quantum digital marketing, quantum\u2010secured smart lock etc.", "venue": "IET Quantum Communication", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-11-28", "journal": {"name": "IET Quantum Communication"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2132325265", "name": "Mritunjay Shall Peelam"}, {"authorId": "2269342193", "name": "Anjaney Asreet Rout"}, {"authorId": "3185174", "name": "V.
