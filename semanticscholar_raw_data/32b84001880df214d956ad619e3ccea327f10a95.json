Despite continuous progress, persistent transactions for crash consistency still incur a 5.6X slowdown, making persistent memory prohibitively costly in practical settings. This paper introduces speculative logging, a new method that forgoes most memory fences and reduces data persistence overhead by logging data values early. This technique enables a novel persistent transaction model, speculatively persistent memory transactions (SpecPMT). Our evaluation shows that SpecPMT reduces the execution time overheads of persistent transactions substantially to just 10%.", "venue": "International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-01-27", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 28th ACM International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems, Volume 2"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1715145", "name": "Chencheng Ye"}, {"authorId": "2118040816", "name": "Yuanchao Xu"}, {"authorId": "2111115725", "name": "Xipeng Shen"}, {"authorId": "2192314080", "name": "Yan Sha"}, {"authorId": "144925807", "name": "Xiaofei Liao"}, {"authorId": "145914251", "name": "Hai Jin"}, {"authorId": "1717365", "name": "Yan Solihin"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "51a04944db95df54b82721077d8e31d32d9514e6", "title": "Prosper: Program Stack Persistence in Hybrid Memory Systems"}, {"paperId": "6146e0cfbf7820e71f8e3c69b972bd1c263ca7dc", "title": "Persistent Processor Architecture"}]}
