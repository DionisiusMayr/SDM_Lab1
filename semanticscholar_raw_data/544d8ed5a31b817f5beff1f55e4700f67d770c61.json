This modeling level offers higher fidelity and greater predictive capability than prior models that rely on logical-address based characterization and modeling. We show how to derive the model, overcoming several challenges of using a publicly-available dataset of memory error logs. We then demonstrate the utility of our model by scaling it and analyzing the expected reliability of DDR5, HBM3, and LPDDR5 based systems. In addition to the novelty of the analysis and the model itself, we draw several insights regarding on-die ECC design and tradeoffs and the efficacy of repair/retirement mechanisms.CCS CONCEPTS\u2022 Hardware \u2192 Hardware reliability; \u2022 Computer systems organization \u2192 Dependable and fault-tolerant systems and networks.", "venue": "Micro", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-10-28", "journal": {"name": "2023 56th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO)", "pages": "944-956"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2029898345", "name": "Jeageun Jung"}, {"authorId": "143676711", "name": "M.
