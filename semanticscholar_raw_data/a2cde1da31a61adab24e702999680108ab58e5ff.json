Meanwhile, there is a growing need for applications that can understand the public's voice in the health domain. To address this we introduce a new corpus called COMETA, consisting of 20k English biomedical entity mentions from Reddit expert-annotated with links to SNOMED CT, a widely-used medical knowledge graph. Our corpus satisfies a combination of desirable properties, from scale and coverage to diversity and quality, that to the best of our knowledge has not been met by any of the existing resources in the field. Through benchmark experiments on 20 EL baselines from string- to neural-based models we shed light on the ability of these systems to perform complex inference on entities and concepts under 2 challenging evaluation scenarios. Our experimental results on COMETA illustrate that no golden bullet exists and even the best mainstream techniques still have a significant performance gap to fill, while the best solution relies on combining different views of data.", "venue": "Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2020-10-07", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2010.03295"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2910801", "name": "Marco Basaldella"}, {"authorId": "144097210", "name": "Fangyu Liu"}, {"authorId": "2888926", "name": "Ehsan Shareghi"}, {"authorId": "50638196", "name": "Nigel Collier"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "6a15aeed098e21cebfff8dfc94a59aaec156b579", "title": "Exploring COVID-related relationship extraction: Contrasting data sources and analyzing misinformation"}, {"paperId": "38a8d0e5fa83dc823744beab08a62511ad9ad227", "title": "Biomedical Entity Linking as Multiple Choice Question Answering"}, {"paperId": "00b68a19a60a0611df19da97365b2cf40c6224b0", "title": "BLINKtextsubscriptLSTM: BioLinkBERT and LSTM based approach for extraction of PICO frame from Clinical Trial Text"}, {"paperId": "595dd3553e3233f461b8ef4f71d4023f723f3376", "title": "Artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) in medicine: A narrative review."}, {"paperId": "174fd03ec2eebca8871b7d9e04f955ebc0f57123", "title": "Improving entity linking by combining semantic entity embeddings and cross-attention encoder"}, {"paperId": "9a937f6488f83a3d5f4153d3bb5ac15d3e671032", "title": "Improving Biomedical Entity Linking with Retrieval-enhanced Learning"}, {"paperId": "0832bd49ece0fe5be708be948f0efb9c4390b420", "title": "xMEN: A Modular Toolkit for Cross-Lingual Medical Entity Normalization"}, {"paperId": "c7492913370b5726eaa6ced163a60de6c9d4bb7f", "title": "A Survey of Large Language Models for Healthcare: from Data, Technology, and Applications to Accountability and Ethics"}, {"paperId": "7b5b7aefc727bdf1e73efdd65af539d79628230a", "title": "A Comprehensive Evaluation of Large Language Models on Benchmark Biomedical Text Processing Tasks"}, {"paperId": "83469a361b5520faf44c0d140a6c43414bf1a9b1", "title": "Weakly Supervised Text Classification on Free Text Comments in Patient-Reported Outcome Measures"}, {"paperId": "d400ab22e100dd4d24672ad69b4f0546439fb000", "title": "Ontology Enrichment from Texts: A Biomedical Dataset for Concept Discovery and Placement"}, {"paperId": "600a811935bedaf25d26b908fa6a79b4c55f1191", "title": "Improving Biomedical Entity Linking with Cross-Entity Interaction"}, {"paperId": "b239648a07d44d71185e48ab79bf5a2bc347e52f", "title": "Medical Data Augmentation via ChatGPT: A Case Study on Medication Identification and Medication Event Classification"}, {"paperId": "12d4cbeea33a6a61d8461648d070fe358c2ac879", "title": "Biomedical Named Entity Recognition via Dictionary-based Synonym Generalization"}, {"paperId": "e61f020e9ea28581ed24d73f4d957b86aa497504", "title": "A Novel Dataset Towards Extracting Virus-Host Interactions"}, {"paperId": "1c8703b93f28db2c748627e176f280b138354c12", "title": "Knowledge-graph-enabled biomedical entity linking: a survey"}, {"paperId": "033cd044b41868c4d1713d917b6ff73f919783c5", "title": "KEBLM: Knowledge-Enhanced Biomedical Language Models"}, {"paperId": "37ebfbc27e9a9a9dd772a472c94c2ae664152508", "title": "MasonNLP+ at SemEval-2023 Task 8: Extracting Medical Questions, Experiences and Claims from Social Media using Knowledge-Augmented Pre-trained Language Models"}, {"paperId": "fab384a1f667b75a1277244acdbc22625d20caf8", "title": "Reveal the Unknown: Out-of-Knowledge-Base Mention Discovery with Entity Linking"}, {"paperId": "949ecc0bc00255e5665954aaa05fd57f9bd6a782", "title": "Language Models sounds the Death Knell of Knowledge Graphs"}, {"paperId": "81d133d94211a42a1bf58e38cbabf7fd65d33e23", "title": "Automatic Extraction of Medication Mentions from Tweets\u2014Overview of the BioCreative VII Shared Task 3 Competition"}, {"paperId": "3bc5a1fd0a746d544be88879f64da60c21251083", "title": "A survey on clinical natural language processing in the United Kingdom from 2007 to 2022"}, {"paperId": "ddd260a356df8fd5325f93d06646b4b7846f50de", "title": "An overview of biomedical entity linking throughout the years"}, {"paperId": "84b3a2b18c1d74fe67454ad8d2ea6c20a08f4bd1", "title": "Detecting Entities in the Astrophysics Literature: A Comparison of Word-based and Span-based Entity Recognition Methods"}, {"paperId": "3a03e639b44bb54ed6809c65e17007d1b21ab9b9", "title": "Question classification using limited labelled data"}, {"paperId": "73b222c2808a95878c8a3aa762b9ba1d4dd9ecd4", "title": "Parameter-Efficient Legal Domain Adaptation"}, {"paperId": "50f268f24f257bbc27c7faf9037a5b5dc76a59ab", "title": "RedHOT: A Corpus of Annotated Medical Questions, Experiences, and Claims on Social Media"}, {"paperId": "9b349c140144c7a1d5e710ce3384f259863c8318", "title": "How do others cope?
