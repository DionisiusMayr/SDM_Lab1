In the actual world, there is no such thing as a flawless security solution for a certain activity or application.Technological growth has provided a variety of different ways over the years that may aid in the development of unique algorithms and techniques. The potential for cyberthreats and cyberattacks grows as more consumer and organizational information is digitized and collected for data analytics. Security and tactical information are two important areas where big data analytics is anticipated to make a substantial contribution. Current security problem and tracking systems (or SIEM) systems, which typically operate with a small selection of traditional data sources like firewalls, intrusion detection systems, etc., in a software system, do not adequately address security analytics in a big data context. The paper addressed the security challenges of big data analytics in social network platform. The paper also looked at the user engagement in different social media platforms.", "venue": "2022 Seventh International Conference on Parallel, Distributed and Grid Computing (PDGC)", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-11-25", "journal": {"name": "2022 Seventh International Conference on Parallel, Distributed and Grid Computing (PDGC)", "pages": "61-66"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "48472136", "name": "Richa Verma"}, {"authorId": "3148138", "name": "Ravindara Bhatt"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "17ebaf3ce5ee7afffefa07eb16c7cffedf6d526a", "title": "Critical Factors Affecting the Intention to Adopt Big Data Analytics in Apparel Sector, Sri Lanka"}]}
