In a sharp contrast and despite extensive studies, all known algorithms that maintain a $2-\\Omega(1)$ approximate matching are much slower. Understanding this gap and, in particular, determining the best possible update time for algorithms providing a better-than-2 approximate matching is a major open question. \nIn this paper, we show that for any constant $\\epsilon > 0$, there is a randomized algorithm that with high probability maintains a $2-\\Omega(1)$ approximate maximum matching of a fully-dynamic general graph in worst-case update time $O(\\Delta^{\\epsilon}+\\text{polylog } n)$, where $\\Delta$ is the maximum degree. \nPreviously, the fastest fully dynamic matching algorithm providing a better-than-2 approximation had $O(m^{1/4})$ update-time [Bernstein and Stein, SODA 2016]. A faster algorithm with update-time $O(n^\\epsilon)$ was known, but worked only for maintaining the size (and not the edges) of the matching in bipartite graphs [Bhattacharya, Henzinger, and Nanongkai, STOC 2016].", "venue": "ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2019-11-05", "journal": {"pages": "2492-2508"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "8176576", "name": "Soheil Behnezhad"}, {"authorId": "34700377", "name": "Jakub Lacki"}, {"authorId": "1728881", "name": "V.
