Coping with the increasing high-throughput and low-latency requirements of modern applications led to a careful investigation and re-design of new tools for stream processing. The first generation of tools, such as Apache Hadoop [19] , Spark [20] , Storm [18] and Kafka [14] , were designed to split an incoming data stream into batches and to then synchronously execute their analytical workflows over these data batches. To overcome the limitations\u2014primarily, the high latency\u2014of this iterative form of bulk-synchronous processing (BSP), asynchronous stream-processing (ASP) engines such as Apache Flink [17] and Samza [15] have also recently emerged.", "venue": "2020 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2020-12-10", "journal": {"name": "2020 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "pages": "5846-5848"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "148325532", "name": "V.
