Scientific workflows consist of diverse applications (i.e., HPC simulations and BD analysis) each with distinct representations of data that introduce a semantic barrier between the two environments. To solve scientific problems at scale, accessing semantically different data from different storage resources is the biggest unsolved challenge. In this work, we aim to address a critical question: \u201dHow can we exploit the existing resources and efficiently provide transparent access to data from/to both environments\u201d. We propose iNtelligent I/O Bridging Engine(NIOBE), a new data integration framework that enables integrated data access for scientific workflows with asynchronous I/O and data aggregation. NIOBE performs the data integration using available I/O resources, in contrast to existing optimizations that ignore the I/O nodes present on the data path. In NIOBE, data access is optimized to consider both the ongoing production and the consumption of the data in the future. Experimental results show that with NIOBE, an integrated scientific workflow can be accelerated by up to 10x when compared to a no-integration baseline and by up to 133% compared to other state-of-the-art integration solutions.", "venue": "2019 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2019-12-01", "journal": {"name": "2019 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "pages": "493-502"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "40444105", "name": "Kun Feng"}, {"authorId": "46251636", "name": "H.
