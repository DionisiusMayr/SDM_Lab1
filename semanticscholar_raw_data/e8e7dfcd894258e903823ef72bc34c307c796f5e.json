It also provides in-depth knowledge on resource management techniques involved while deploying big data processing systems in the cloud environment. It starts from the very basics and gradually introduce the core components of resource management which are divided into multiple layers. It covers the state-of-art practices and researches done in SLA-based resource management with a specific focus on the job scheduling mechanisms.", "venue": "Handbook of Research on Cloud Computing and Big Data Applications in IoT", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2018-12-03", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/1812.00563"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1707634", "name": "Muhammed Tawfiqul Islam"}, {"authorId": "1709598", "name": "R.
