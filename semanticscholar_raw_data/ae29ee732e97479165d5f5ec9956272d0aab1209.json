Data-driven knowledge extraction and re-usage can be a valid source of information to study the whole building life-cycle as a process to optimize. Today, new challenges can be provided thanks to ICT and Internet of Things (IoT) paradigms that allow big data to be stored, processed and analysed. This approach is still not deeply applied in construction engineering fields. In order to analyse the related literature, first a framework to describe the IB technological environment is proposed. Second, the literature is reviewed according to this framework and focusing on ICT tools and implementation aspects for the whole building life-cycle. To the best of our knowledge, there isn't yet a survey focusing on innovative operative tools adopted in the development of the ICT technological layer of IB. The reviewed literature is discussed by identifying implemented technologies and related ICT tools and classifying applications in building life-cycle. Finally, critical aspects are singled out and opportunities for future developments in the field of IBs are outlined.", "venue": "Journal of Information Technology in Construction", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2021-07-26", "journal": {"name": "J.
