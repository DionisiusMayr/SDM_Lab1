These applications require a low latency response in order to ensure the user's quality of service (QoS). Fog computing is a promising solution to the high latency drawback of cloud computing, it allows provisioning resources and services at the proximity of end users. In this paper we give a detailed overview about the definition of fog computing, its architecture and potentials as opposed to cloud computing. State of the art surveys published in the years 2017 and 2018 are presented to guide the readers towards the current trends. Moreover, this survey highlights the most significant applications of fog computing, and reviews twelve recently proposed works for applications in smart cities, smart transportation, tele-surveillance, health care and multimedia. Finally, fog computing challenges and future research opportunities are discussed.", "venue": "International Conferences on Computing Advancements", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2018-08-01", "journal": {"name": "2018 International Conference on Computer and Applications (ICCA)", "pages": "399-406"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "8685373", "name": "Fatima Haouari"}, {"authorId": "51309295", "name": "Ranim Faraj"}, {"authorId": "9306890", "name": "J.
