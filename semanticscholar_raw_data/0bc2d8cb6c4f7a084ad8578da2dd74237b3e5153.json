Systems can generate large amounts of provenance data depending on the granularity and abstractions modeled for that system. Methods developed for managing and performing analytics over provenance data sets were created before the standardization of the ontology and data model. This initial work focuses on revisiting older provenance analytics methods and applying them to the new standard while also bringing them into a introducing big data platforms and infrastructure to tackle the issue of big provenance.", "venue": "2019 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2019-12-01", "journal": {"name": "2019 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "pages": "6142-6144"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "51056521", "name": "Crisrael Lucero"}, {"authorId": "2056638963", "name": "Phuong H.
