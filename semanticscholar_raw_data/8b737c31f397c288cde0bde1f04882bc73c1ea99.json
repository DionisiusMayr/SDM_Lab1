Various dimensionality reduction and Feature Selection (FS) techniques have been developed to alleviate these challenges. Random Forest (RF), a widely-used Ensemble Learning Method (ELM), is recognized for its high accuracy and robustness, including its lesser-known capability for effective FS. While specialized RF models are designed for FS, they often struggle with computational efficiency on large datasets. Addressing these challenges, this study proposes a novel Feature Selection Model (FSM) integrated with data reduction techniques, termed Dynamic Correlated Regularized Random Forest (DCRRF). The architecture operates in four phases: Preprocessing, Feature Reduction (FR) using Best-First Search with Rough Set Theory (BFS-RST), FS through DCRRF, and feature efficacy assessment using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Benchmarked against four gene expression datasets, the proposed model outperforms existing RF-based methods in computational efficiency and classification accuracy. This study introduces a robust and efficient approach to feature selection in high-dimensional big-data scenarios.", "venue": "International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2264980887", "name": "Huan Wang"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "66f22d45b0c07ed00f3a50b181fc648f20112a0e", "title": "Mapping tree carbon density using sentinel 2A sensor on Google Earth Engine in Darjeeling Himalayas: Implication for tree carbon management and climate change mitigation"}]}
