Recent works about high-quality instruction-following data generation and selection require amounts of human labor to conceive model-understandable instructions for the given tasks and carefully filter the LLM-generated data. In this work, we introduce an automatic instruction augmentation method named INSTRAUG in multimodal tasks. It starts from a handful of basic and straightforward meta instructions but can expand an instruction-following dataset by 30 times. Results on two popular multimodal instructionfollowing benchmarks MULTIINSTRUCT and InstructBLIP show that INSTRAUG can significantly improve the alignment of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) across 12 multimodal tasks, which is even equivalent to the benefits of scaling up training data multiple times.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-02-22", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2402.14492"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2114925665", "name": "Wei Han"}, {"authorId": "2155552055", "name": "Hui Chen"}, {"authorId": "1746416", "name": "Soujanya Poria"}], "citations": []}
