However, with the increasing deployment of UAS, several cybersecurity challenges have emerged, particularly vulnerabilities in GPS transmissions. GPS jamming attacks pose a significant threat to VAS, resulting in performance degradation and capability loss. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach for detecting jamming attacks on GPS transmissions in UAS. The proposed approach combines Naive Bayes and Multi-Layer Perceptron algorithms to offer efficient and precise detection of GPS jamming attacks. We evaluated the proposed approach's performance against various machine learning (ML) models using a synthetic dataset. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in detecting jamming attacks in GPS transmissions, achieving better accuracy than other ML models under several jammers.", "venue": "Global Communications Conference", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-12-04", "journal": {"name": "GLOBECOM 2023 - 2023 IEEE Global Communications Conference", "pages": "443-448"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "5572992", "name": "H.
