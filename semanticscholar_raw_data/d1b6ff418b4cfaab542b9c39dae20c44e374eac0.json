Formalized using causal models (Pearl 2000, Halpern & Pearl 2005, Schulz 2011), the analysis hinges on the asymmetric inference patterns licensed by necessary versus suf\ufb01cient causes in the common scenario where some variables in a causal model remain uncertain. States of certainty/uncertainty are captured by subdividing the traditional de\ufb01nitions of necessity and suf\ufb01ciency into a local version (all other variables \ufb01xed at particular values) and a global version (all other variables unsettled). C causes E is argued to entail that C is locally suf\ufb01cient for E , and to implicate that C is at least possibly locally necessary for E . With this de\ufb01nition, it is shown that C causes E can be truthfully applied to more uncertain contexts when C is a globally suf\ufb01cient cause of E rather than a globally necessary one. Cause thus tends to occur with outcomes depending on a single globally suf\ufb01cient cause \u2014 outcomes which are moreover shown to be negative in sentiment, re\ufb02ecting the independently motivated \u201cAnna Karenina Principle\u201d that bad outcomes tend to require single suf\ufb01cient causes, thus indirectly explaining why cause prefers negative-sentiment complements. The meaning and collocational sentiment of cause are used to illuminate one another.", "venue": "Semantics and Pragmatics", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-10-18", "journal": {"name": "Semantics and Pragmatics"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2260456627", "name": "Lelia Glass"}], "citations": []}
