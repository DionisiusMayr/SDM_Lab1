We call the system that supports these tasks a metadata lake. We explain the underlying architectural principles that are required to achieve such a system and describe our current implementation. We show how our metadata lake is used to achieve certain advanced capabilities and report on its performance.", "venue": "Middleware Industry", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-11-07", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 23rd International Middleware Conference Industrial Track"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "152962744", "name": "D.
