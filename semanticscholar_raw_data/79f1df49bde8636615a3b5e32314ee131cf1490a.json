To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a T-RBAC (trust-role based access control) model based on two-dimensional dynamic trust assessment, Using AHP and Grey theory to quantify the role attribute trust in the dimension of the doctor\u2019s own attributes, Using Euler\u2019s measurement method and probability statistics to quantify doctors\u2019 behavioral trust in the dimension of historical behavior, then, the trust rule base performs hierarchical authorization based on the comprehensive trust value obtained by the weighted average. Multiattribute trust comprehensive evaluation makes the access control model have finer access granularity and higher security. At the same time, the introduction of time decay function and penalty function enhances the model\u2019s sensitivity, dynamics, and resistance to bleaching attacks.", "venue": "Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-08-12", "journal": {"name": "Wirel.
