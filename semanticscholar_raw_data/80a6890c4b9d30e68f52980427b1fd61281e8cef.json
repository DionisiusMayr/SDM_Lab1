However, one problem that occurs during RFID data capturing is false positives (i.e., tags that are accidentally detected by the reader but not of interest to the business process). This paper investigates using machine learning algorithms to filter false positives. Raw RFID data were collected based on various tagged product movements, and statistical features were extracted from the received signal strength derived from the raw RFID data. Abnormal RFID data or outliers may arise in real cases. Therefore, we utilized outlier detection models to remove outlier data. The experiment results showed that machine learning-based models successfully classified RFID readings with high accuracy, and integrating outlier detection with machine learning models improved classification accuracy. We demonstrated the proposed classification model could be applied to real-time monitoring, ensuring false positives were filtered and hence not stored in the database. The proposed model is expected to improve warehouse management systems by monitoring delivered products to other supply chain partners.", "venue": "Applied Sciences", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2019-03-19", "journal": {"name": "Applied Sciences"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3212733", "name": "Ganjar Alfian"}, {"authorId": "2913270", "name": "Muhammad Syafrudin"}, {"authorId": "100709173", "name": "Bohan Yoon"}, {"authorId": "3353468", "name": "J.
