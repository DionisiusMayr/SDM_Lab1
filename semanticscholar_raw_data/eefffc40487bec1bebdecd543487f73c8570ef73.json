Computing the origin of query results is one of the challenges considered in this research project. Previously, the Chase has been used to calculate why-provenance of simple conjunctive queries. However, applying the Chase to more realistic scenarios requires an extension of the algorithm, for example with negation. This work reveals opportunities for the extended Chase by calculating both why-and why-not provenance of conjunctive queries with negation.", "venue": "PhD@VLDB", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"pages": "29-32"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "39987433", "name": "A.
