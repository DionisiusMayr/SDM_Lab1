Treatment strategy depends on the severity of the disease course. IBD physicians need to be aware of the life-long treatment options available. The goal is not only to achieve clinical remission but to halt or stabilize the chronic inflammation in the intestines to prevent further structural damage. Therefore, the use of early biologic therapy is recommended in moderate-to-severe IBD patients. However, in the last decade, use of therapeutic drug monitoring has increased considerably, opening an opportunity for sequencing. This review summarizes the available evidence on biologic and small molecules therapy in Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) in different clinical scenarios, including perianal CD, the elderly, extra intestinal manifestations, and pregnancy.", "venue": "Biomedicines", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-03-23", "journal": {"name": "Biomedicines", "volume": "10"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1420156457", "name": "G.
