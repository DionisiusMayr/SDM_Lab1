We review the existing GeoXAI studies, argue the need for comprehensible explanations with human-centered approaches, and outline a research path toward XAI for Mobility Data Science.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-07-17", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2307.08461"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "66533544", "name": "Anahid N.
