However, in implementing these changes one of the major issues faced by the agri-food researchers is the fragmentation of the \u201cassets\u201d to be exploited when performing research tasks, e.g. data of interest are heterogeneous and scattered across several repositories, the tools modellers rely on are diverse and often make use of limited computing capacity, the publishing practices are various and rarely aim at making available the \u201cwhole story\u201d with datasets, processes, work\ufb02ows. This paper presents the AGINFRA PLUS endeavour to overcome these limitations by providing researchers in three designated communities with Virtual Research Environments facilitating the use of the \u201cassets\u201d of interest and promote collaboration.", "venue": "", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2671645", "name": "M.
