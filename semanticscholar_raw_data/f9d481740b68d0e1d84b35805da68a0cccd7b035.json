This paper hence employs a systematic literature review and qualitative analysis techniques to identify, analyze and synthesize extant conceptual contributions on how big data drives the innovation process, where this process takes place, and which theoretical perspectives have shaped the research on big data innovation so far. Our findings reveal that big data innovation primarily takes place cooperatively, in the form of open innovation or within innovation networks, and that it is simultaneously driven by a variety of drivers. However, purposeful applications of big data and analytics for innovating in response to existing but unsatisfied market needs (\"market pull\") remain comparatively underresearched. Concomitantly, the theoretical lenses of \u201ctraditional\u201d innovation management have largely framed the research on big data innovation so far. We coherently integrate these findings within an overarching framework and suggest an extensive future research agenda.", "venue": "Journal of Innovation Management", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-07-18", "journal": {"name": "Journal of Innovation Management"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "118922454", "name": "Neboj\u0161a Radojevi\u0107"}, {"authorId": "3410166", "name": "Erich Heum\u00fcller"}], "citations": []}
