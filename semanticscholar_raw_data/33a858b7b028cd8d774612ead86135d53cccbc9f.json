However, while using the term ECC becomes increasingly common, there is still no clear and commonly accepted consensus on what the term entails and which properties the ECC environment must possess. Consequently, there is a lack of tools and examples for reasoning about applications in ECC and their specific properties. In this paper, we present the results of our literature study aimed at identifying the most common properties ascribed to ECC. Based on this, we outline a reference component model that can serve as a tool for reasoning about ECC systems and their properties.", "venue": "2023 IEEE 20th International Conference on Software Architecture Companion (ICSA-C)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-03-01", "journal": {"name": "2023 IEEE 20th International Conference on Software Architecture Companion (ICSA-C)", "pages": "91-95"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "51205209", "name": "Danylo Khalyeyev"}, {"authorId": "1795139", "name": "T.
