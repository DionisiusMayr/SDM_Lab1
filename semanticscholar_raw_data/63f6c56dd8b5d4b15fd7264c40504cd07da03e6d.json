A popular sketch type is Quantiles, which estimates the data distribution of a large input stream. We present Quancurrent, a highly scalable concurrent Quantiles sketch. Quancurrent's throughput increases linearly with the number of available threads, and with 32 threads, it reaches an update speedup of 12x and a query speedup of 30x over a sequential sketch. Quancurrent allows queries to occur concurrently with updates and achieves an order of magnitude better query freshness than existing scalable solutions.", "venue": "ACM Symposium on Parallelism in Algorithms and Architectures", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-08-19", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 35th ACM Symposium on Parallelism in Algorithms and Architectures"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2218604653", "name": "Shaked Elias Zada"}, {"authorId": "73775824", "name": "Arik Rinberg"}, {"authorId": "1777373", "name": "I.
