The key to this approach is Gluon, a communication-optimizing substrate. Programmers write applications in a shared-memory programming system of their choice and interface these applications with Gluon using a lightweight API. Gluon enables these programs to run on heterogeneous clusters and optimizes communication in a novel way by exploiting structural and temporal invariants of graph partitioning policies. To demonstrate Gluon\u2019s ability to support different programming models, we interfaced Gluon with the Galois and Ligra shared-memory graph analytics systems to produce distributed-memory versions of these systems named D-Galois and D-Ligra, respectively. To demonstrate Gluon\u2019s ability to support heterogeneous processors, we interfaced Gluon with IrGL, a state-of-the-art single-GPU system for graph analytics, to produce D-IrGL, the first multi-GPU distributed-memory graph analytics system. Our experiments were done on CPU clusters with up to 256 hosts and roughly 70,000 threads and on multi-GPU clusters with up to 64 GPUs. The communication optimizations in Gluon improve end-to-end application execution time by \u223c2.6\u00d7 on the average. D-Galois and D-IrGL scale well and are faster than Gemini, the state-of-the-art distributed CPU graph analytics system, by factors of \u223c3.9\u00d7 and \u223c4.9\u00d7, respectively, on the average.", "venue": "ACM-SIGPLAN Symposium on Programming Language Design and Implementation", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2018-06-11", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 39th ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1925460", "name": "Roshan Dathathri"}, {"authorId": "49983901", "name": "G.
