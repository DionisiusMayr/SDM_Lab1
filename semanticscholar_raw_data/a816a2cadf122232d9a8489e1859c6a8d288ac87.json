For that purpose, the existing convolutional, long short-term memory (LSTM) and feed-forward autoencoders were combined with a suitable domain adaptation procedure. Eventually, the developed models were evaluated on data collected in four buildings with signi\ufb01-cant di\ufb00erences in thermal mass, design and location. The \ufb01ndings pointed out that the domain adaptation can be conducted e\ufb03ciently by using a small data sample from the target domain. Additionally, the re-sults showed that the proposed model can reconstruct up to 80 % of the missing daily room temperature inputs with RMSE accuracy of 0.6 \u00b0 C.", "venue": "Building Simulation Conference Proceedings", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2021-09-01", "journal": {"name": "Building Simulation Conference Proceedings"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "32396697", "name": "A.
