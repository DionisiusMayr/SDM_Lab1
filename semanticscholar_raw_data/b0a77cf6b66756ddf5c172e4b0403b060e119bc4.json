Numerous users and businesses have already moved to the cloud for accessing the services that are offered by a variety of cloud service providers. To handle so many requests and clients, cloud providers must manage their servers. As a result, service providers must manage the load to guarantee that resources are being used effectively. The problem of load balancing is known to be NP-hard, and a number of researchers have suggested a variety of solutions using meta-heuristic algorithms. The paper provides a mutative bacterial Foraging optimization to reduce response time and improve resource utilization. In a heterogeneous cloud setup with dynamic workloads, the proposed algorithm performs better when compared to the other meta-heuristic algorithm.", "venue": "2022 International Conference on Edge Computing and Applications (ICECAA)", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-10-13", "journal": {"name": "2022 International Conference on Edge Computing and Applications (ICECAA)", "pages": "67-70"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "152117542", "name": "S.
