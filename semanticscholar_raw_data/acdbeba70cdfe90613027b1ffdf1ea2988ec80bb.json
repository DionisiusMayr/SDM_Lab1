It can assist in the control of beehives in remote locations. It is possible to classify bee swarm activity from audio signals using such approaches. A deep neural networks IoT-based acoustic swarm classification is proposed in this paper. Audio recordings were obtained from the Open Source Beehive project. Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients features were extracted from the audio signal. The lossless WAV and lossy MP3 audio formats were compared for IoT-based solutions. An analysis was made of the impact of the deep neural network parameters on the classification results. The best overall classification accuracy with uncompressed audio was 94.09%, but MP3 compression degraded the DNN accuracy by over 10%. The evaluation of the proposed deep neural networks IoT-based bee activity acoustic classification showed improved results if compared to the previous hidden Markov models system.", "venue": "Italian National Conference on Sensors", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-01-20", "journal": {"name": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "volume": "21"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1969787", "name": "Andrej Zgank"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "6b4a186cfe1eef76f40a0dda413db0688ceb5e38", "title": "BeeOpen\u2014An Open Data Sharing Ecosystem for Apiculture"}, {"paperId": "369f2a1f28782ed4ae1da2fe991760bf371b3fc9", "title": "Emerging artificial intelligence applications: metaverse, IoT, cybersecurity, healthcare -
