In this paper, we propose the architecture for malware detection, a method to detect malware using flow information, and a method to decrease the amount of transmission data between the servers in this architecture. We evaluate the performance of malware detection and the amount of data before and after the data reduction. And show that the performance of malware detection is maintained even though the amount of data is reduced.", "venue": "Enterprise Information Systems", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-11-09", "journal": {"name": "Enterprise Information Systems", "volume": "17"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2135027622", "name": "Masataka Nakahara"}, {"authorId": "1490916289", "name": "Norihiro Okui"}, {"authorId": "1965900227", "name": "Yasuaki Kobayashi"}, {"authorId": "35261945", "name": "Yutaka Miyake"}, {"authorId": "2614582", "name": "A.
