Network science has been applied to climate data to study the dynamics of a climate network. The core task to enable network dynamics analysis on climate data is the efficient computation and update of the correlation matrix for user-defined time-windows on historical and real-time data. We present TSUBASA, an algorithm for efficiently computing the exact pair-wise time-series correlation based on Pearson's correlation. By pre-computing simple and low-overhead sketches, TSUBASA can efficiently compute exact pairwise correlations on arbitrary time windows at query time. For real-time data, TSUBASA proposes a fast and incremental way of updating the correlation matrix. We provide a detailed time and space complexity analysis of TSUBASA. Our experiments show that with the same space overhead as a DFT-based approximate solution, TSUBASA has a lower sketching time and is on par with the approximate solution with respect to query time. TSUBASA is at least one order of magnitude faster than a baseline for both historical and real-time data.", "venue": "SIGMOD Conference", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Physics"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-03-23", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 2022 International Conference on Management of Data"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2187863251", "name": "Yunlong Xu"}, {"authorId": "2144132122", "name": "Jinshu Liu"}, {"authorId": "2315516", "name": "F.
