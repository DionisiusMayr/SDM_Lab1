Oscillatory neural networks (ONNs) are an alternative approach in emulating biological functions of the human brain and are suitable for solving large and complex associative problems. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of coupled oscillators to implement such ONNs. By harnessing the complex dynamics of coupled oscillatory systems, we forge a novel computation model\u2014information is encoded in the phase of oscillations. Coupled interconnected oscillators can exhibit various behaviors due to the strength of the coupling. In this article, we present a novel method based on subharmonic injection locking (SHIL) for controlling the oscillatory states of coupled oscillators that allow them to lock in frequency with distinct phase differences. Circuit-level simulation results indicate SHIL effectiveness and its applicability to large-scale oscillatory networks for pattern recognition.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-09-08", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems", "pages": "1996-2009", "volume": "33"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1404803112", "name": "A.
