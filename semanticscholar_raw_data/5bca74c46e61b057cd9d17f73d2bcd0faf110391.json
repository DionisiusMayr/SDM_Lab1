In such settings, resource demands will inevitably exceed available capacity sometimes. \"Fair\" resource allocation may offer a systematic way of partitioning resources across competing workloads during such periods of scarcity. Existing works only offer fair allocation strategies for a single resource (capacity or bandwidth) within a flash device in isolation. However, since there exist multiple critical resources that need to be partitioned within a flash device and they are correlated to each other, fair allocation of a single resource may result in a waste of other resource(s) or performance degradation of workload(s). To this end, we make a case for multi-resource fair allocation solutions for flash-based caches that consolidate multiple workloads. Furthermore, we argue that device lifetime, which depends on the behavior of running workloads, should also be considered as a first-class resource on par with capacity and bandwidth. Specifically, we build upon existing ideas related to dominant resource fairness (DRF) to devise flash-specific multi-resource fair algorithms: (i) nDRF, that jointly allocates capacity and bandwidth taking their non-linear relationship into account; (ii) \u2113DRF, that explicitly considers lifetime as well in its allocation; and (iii) several variants of these. Our experimental evaluation offers important findings: (i) both nDRF and \u2113DRF result in superior performance fairness compared to the state-of-the-art techniques that partition capacity in isolation; (ii) \u2113DRF additionally offers improved device \"wear\" behavior; and (iii) our algorithms combined with reasonable demand prediction work very well in online settings with workload dynamism and uncertainty.", "venue": "International Middleware Conference", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book"], "publicationDate": "2022-11-07", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 23rd ACM/IFIP International Middleware Conference"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2505238", "name": "Wonil Choi"}, {"authorId": "1684443", "name": "B.
