Standardized information models (Companion Specifications, CS) in OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA), address this problem in the area of industrial communication. However, control system manufacturers who enable an OPC UA connection of their products do not always allow individualized data modelling according to the process-relevant CS. Therefore, this paper presents a methodology for the integration of standardized information models into existing OPC UA servers, which should be used as a basis for further data processing mechanisms. The methodology describes the steps of the integration process and focuses in particular on mapping possibilities of the original models to those created according to CS.", "venue": "IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-09-06", "journal": {"name": "2022 IEEE 27th International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA)", "pages": "1-7"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2120175832", "name": "Aleksandra M\u00fcller"}, {"authorId": "2188868352", "name": "Tim Schnieders"}, {"authorId": "46186819", "name": "S.
