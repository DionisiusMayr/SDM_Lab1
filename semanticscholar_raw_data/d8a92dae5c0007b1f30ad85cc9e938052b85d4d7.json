However, these new technologies have also made healthcare data not only much larger in size but also substantially more difficult to handle and process. Moreover, because the data are created from a variety of devices within a short time span, these data are stored in different formats and created quickly, which can to a large extent be regarded as a big data problem. This paper discusses how to develop intelligent patientcentric healthcare applications and services from the perspectives of mobile computing and big data analytics technologies. This healthcare system consists of a data collection layer with a unified standard, a data management layer for distributed storage and parallel computing, and a data-oriented service layer. Furthermore, various healthcare applications are discussed to show that mobile computing and big data technologies enhance the performance of the system toward improving a humans well-being.",
