An important aspect that has not been examined in these systems is their energy consumption during the application execution. Reducing the power consumption of modern datacenters is a necessity as datacenters contribute over 2% of the total US electric usage. One way of addressing this energy issue is by scheduling the applications in an energy-efficient way. However, efficiently scheduling applications can be challenging as we need to consider the trade-off between the datacenter's energy usage and per application performance requirements. In this work we propose, ExpREsS, a scheduler for orchestrating the execution of Spark applications so that it both minimizes the energy consumption and satisfies the applications' performance requirements. Our approach exploits time-series prediction models for capturing the applications' energy usage and execution times, and then applies a novel DVFS technique to minimize the energy consumption. Our detailed experimental evaluation using realistic workloads on our local cluster illustrates the working and benefits of our approach.", "venue": "International Conference on Automation and Computing", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2017-07-01", "journal": {"name": "2017 IEEE International Conference on Autonomic Computing (ICAC)", "pages": "27-32"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "8982148", "name": "Stathis Maroulis"}, {"authorId": "2125879", "name": "Nikos Zacheilas"}, {"authorId": "1685532", "name": "V.
