Warded Datalog+/-, a fragment from the Datalog+/- family, satisfies these requirements, by offering high expressive power and at the same time preserving tractability of query answering. The Vadalog system, a knowledge graph management system developed by the University of Oxford and Banca d\u2019Italia, adopts Warded Datalog+/-as its core language. This enables Vadalog to solve many ontological reasoning tasks including those where complex graph traversal operations are involved. To control graph navigation, Vadalog combines different rules prioritization policies and join implementations. In this paper, a short version of our recent contribution appeared in the Journal of Information Systems, we describe Vadalog from an architectural point of view, focusing on the execution model, graph traversal strategies, and join algorithms. We also provide an experimental evaluation of the system.", "venue": "Sistemi Evoluti per Basi di Dati", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"pages": "300-308"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1716855", "name": "Luigi Bellomarini"}, {"authorId": "105049426", "name": "Davide Benedetto"}, {"authorId": "1739608", "name": "Emanuel Sallinger"}], "citations": []}
