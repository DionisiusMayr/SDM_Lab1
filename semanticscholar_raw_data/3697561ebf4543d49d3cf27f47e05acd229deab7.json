QPSeeker takes a step towards a neural database planner, encapsulating the information of the data and the given workload to learn the distributions of cardinalities, costs and execution times of the query plan space. At inference, when a query is submitted to the database, QPSeeker uses its learned cost model and traverses the query plan space using Monte Carlo Tree Search to provide an execution plan for the query", "venue": "International Conference on Extending Database Technology", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"pages": "307-319"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2216569697", "name": "Christos Tsapelas"}, {"authorId": "1680709", "name": "Georgia Koutrika"}], "citations": []}
