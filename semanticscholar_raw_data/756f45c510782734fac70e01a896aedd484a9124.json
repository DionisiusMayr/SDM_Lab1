This paper considers the problem of scheduling opportunistic links in reconfigurable datacenters such as ProjecToR. We study the online setting and aim to minimize flow completion times. The problem is a two-tier generalization of classic switch scheduling problems. We present a stable-matching algorithm which is O(\u03b5^-2 )-competitive against an optimal offline algorithm, in a resource augmentation model: the online algorithm runs 2+\u03b5 times faster. Our algorithm and result are fairly general and allow for different link delays and also apply to hybrid topologies which combine fixed and reconfigurable links. Our analysis is based on LP relaxation and dual fitting.", "venue": "ACM Symposium on Parallelism in Algorithms and Architectures", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2020-10-15", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 33rd ACM Symposium on Parallelism in Algorithms and Architectures"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2876647", "name": "Janardhan Kulkarni"}, {"authorId": "144594844", "name": "S.
