Using the combination of physical simulation, FLAC3D numerical calculation, and theoretical analysis, the instability mechanisms, the characteristics of the fracture structure, and fracture evolution between the coal pillars and the interval rocks were all studied. The results showed that a layout position existed that induced instability and subsidence of the coal pillars of the upper coal seam. The instability mechanism was such that the concentrated stress of the upper and lower coal pillars caused shear plastic damage in the interval rock along the direction of stress-transfer influence angle. The phenomenon of \u201cinclined step beam\u201d fracture structure, falling fracture zone, and severe mine pressure happened during seam group mining. Furthermore, the minimum center offset formula was put forward to study the instability of the upper coal pillars. This study provides a theoretical basis for a reasonable layout on how to position coal pillars for shallow coal seams group mining.", "venue": "Advance in Civil Engineering", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2023-03-21", "journal": {"name": "Advances in Civil Engineering"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2148250533", "name": "Tielin Shang"}, {"authorId": "2128724364", "name": "Jindong Wang"}, {"authorId": "1822122850", "name": "Yuwei Liu"}, {"authorId": "2035414726", "name": "Y.
