As each CR pair can be used only once to make the CIS PUF resistant to the modeling attack, CR authentication with CIS can be carried out 4050 times, with basic post-processing to generate the PUF ID. If a larger number of authentications is required, advanced post-processing using Lehmer encoding can be utilized to carry out authentication 14,858 times. According to the PUF performance evaluation, the authentication error rate is less than 0.001 ppm. Furthermore, the area overhead of the CIS chip for the basic and advanced post-processing is only 1% and 2%, respectively, based on a Verilog HDL model circuit design.", "venue": "Italian National Conference on Sensors", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-09-01", "journal": {"name": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "volume": "21"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2218345", "name": "S.
