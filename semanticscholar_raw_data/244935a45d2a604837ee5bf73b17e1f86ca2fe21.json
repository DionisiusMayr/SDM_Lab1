As we find more use cases, deployments need to be able to run multiple packet-processing modules in a single device. These are likely to be developed by independent teams, either within the same organization or from multiple organizations. Therefore, we need isolation mechanisms to ensure that modules on the same device do not interfere with each other. This paper presents Menshen, an extension of the Reconfigurable Match Tables (RMT) pipeline that enforces isolation between different packet-processing modules. Menshen is comprised of a set of lightweight hardware primitives and an extension to the open source P4-16 reference compiler that act in conjunction to meet this goal. We have prototyped Menshen on two FPGA platforms (NetFPGA and Corundum). We show that our design provides isolation, and allows new modules to be loaded without impacting the ones already running. Finally, we demonstrate that feasibility of implementing Menshen on ASICs by using the FreePDK45nm technology library and the Synopsys DC synthesis software, showing that our design meets timing at a 1GHz clock frequency and needs approximately 6% additional chip area. We have open sourced the code for Menshen's hardware and software at https://isolation.quest/.", "venue": "Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2021-01-29", "journal": {"pages": "1289-1305"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2155456826", "name": "Tao Wang"}, {"authorId": "2286255026", "name": "Xiangrui Yang"}, {"authorId": "2272991187", "name": "Gianni Antichi"}, {"authorId": "39118448", "name": "Anirudh Sivaraman"}, {"authorId": "3169583", "name": "Aurojit Panda"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "c31153985ae74042e5e1076c97ffb1d7dce1c8d5", "title": "XAV: A High-Performance Regular Expression Matching Engine for Packet Processing"}, {"paperId": "5c91abf19352d6ff651ca3f3497193fab1f823a4", "title": "QVISOR: Virtualizing Packet Scheduling Policies"}, {"paperId": "1b15307003022f637beb6cc9e004bf8f9e0c92d5", "title": "OSMOSIS: Enabling Multi-Tenancy in Datacenter SmartNICs"}, {"paperId": "9c80f14529e9ce1d9c641f6bbb9249ff355e6285", "title": "Poster: Continual Network Learning"}, {"paperId": "3f9dacb6da0848f174c20387c843204950ddff67", "title": "Improving the Deployment of Multi-Tenant Containerized Network Function Acceleration"}, {"paperId": "48475f621946e1927b533df06dda35d9236dcf4e", "title": "Slicing networks with P4 hardware and software targets"}, {"paperId": "992e0804e64b92fba67e0d2f1247f85653bdea12", "title": "A Vision for Runtime Programmable Networks"}, {"paperId": "c6b81ec1de0f2fe2f08f0b720ce4745c98aaf487", "title": "Understanding RDMA Microarchitecture Resources for Performance Isolation"}, {"paperId": "c3c7c7203f66c15212141e32d3530d628a544687", "title": "the Proceedings of the 20th USENIX Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation"}]}
