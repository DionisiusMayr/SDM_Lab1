Abstract This paper is a study of deep learning among artificial intelligence technology which has been developing many technologies recently. Especially, I am talking about emotional computing that has been mentioned a lot recently during deep learning. Emotional computing, in other words, is a passive concept that is dominated by people who scientifically analyze human sensibilities and reflect them in product development or system design, and a more active concept that studies how devices and systems understand humans and communicate with people in different modes. This emotional signal extraction, sensitivity, and psychology recognition technology is defined as a technology to process, analyze, and recognize psycho-sensitivity based on micro-small, hyper-sensor technology, and sensitive signals and information that can be sensed by the active movement of the autonomic nervous system caused by human emotional changes in everyday life. Chapter 1 talks about overview and Chapter 2 shows related research. Chapter 3 shows the problems and models of real emotional computing and Chapter 4 shows this paper as a conclusion.", "venue": "J.
