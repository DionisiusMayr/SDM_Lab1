Securing the valuable data from the intruders, viruses and worms are a challenge for the past several decades. So many researchers developed methods and technologies to protect the data. Since all traditional technologies are applicable for only their structured data, we required a new technology to secure and make privacy in the structured, semi-structured and unstructured data (Big Data). In this research paper we have studied various security and privacy methodologies proposed by the various researchers and analyse the merits and demerits of those methodologies. The term Big Data refers to large-scale information management and analysis technologies that exceed the capability of traditional data processing technologies. Big Data is differentiated from traditional technologies in three ways: the amount of data (volume), the rate of data and transmission (velocity), and the types of structured and unstructured data (variety).
