This is usually employed by utilizing UAV s that are versatile. Cameras may be equipped to capture images for further assessment. In processing these, nature-inspired approaches have emerged such as the FA and PSO. Utilizing each on its own poses advantages and disadvantages but may be addressed by the proposed hybrid FA-PSO. Specifically, FA is simple and robust but falls short, given it lacks memory in storing the best solution. This is where PSO comes, where it can record both the local and the global best solution and provide faster convergence. The algorithm was tested using images from an aerial dataset for floating objects. Results show that the proposed algorithm was able to obtain faster convergence at the global optimum when compared to its traditional counterpart.", "venue": "2023 IEEE Region 10 Symposium (TENSYMP)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2023-09-06", "journal": {"name": "2023 IEEE Region 10 Symposium (TENSYMP)", "pages": "1-6"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2204892823", "name": "Marck Herzon C.
