Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) offers a promising solution for LLM compression. However, state-of-the-art SVD-based LLM compression methods have two key limitations: truncating smaller singular values may lead to higher compression loss, and the lack of update on the compressed weight after SVD truncation. In this work, we propose SVD-LLM, a new SVD-based LLM compression method that addresses the limitations of existing methods. SVD-LLM incorporates a truncation-aware data whitening strategy to ensure a direct mapping between singular values and compression loss. Moreover, SVD-LLM adopts a layer-wise closed-form model parameter update strategy to compensate for accuracy degradation under high compression ratios. We evaluate SVD-LLM on a total of 10 datasets and eight models from three different LLM families at four different scales. Our results demonstrate the superiority of SVD-LLM over state-of-the-arts, especially at high model compression ratios.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-03-12", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2403.07378"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2272325489", "name": "Xin Wang"}, {"authorId": "2149514527", "name": "Yu Zheng"}, {"authorId": "2240538849", "name": "Zhongwei Wan"}, {"authorId": "2290589932", "name": "Mi Zhang"}], "citations": []}
