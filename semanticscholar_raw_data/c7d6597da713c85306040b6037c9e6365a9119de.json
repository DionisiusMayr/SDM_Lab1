However, existing models for MQA under KE exhibit poor performance when dealing with questions containing explicit temporal contexts. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework, namely TEMPoral knowLEdge augmented Multi-hop Question Answering (TEMPLE-MQA). Unlike previous methods, TEMPLE-MQA first constructs a time-aware graph (TAG) to store edit knowledge in a structured manner. Then, through our proposed inference path, structural retrieval, and joint reasoning stages, TEMPLE-MQA effectively discerns temporal contexts within the question query. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that TEMPLE-MQA significantly outperforms baseline models. Additionally, we contribute a new dataset, namely TKEMQA, which serves as the inaugural benchmark tailored specifically for MQA with temporal scopes.", "venue": "", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2024-03-30", "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2294877265", "name": "Keyuan Cheng"}, {"authorId": "2294517405", "name": "Gang Lin"}, {"authorId": "2294359281", "name": "Haoyang Fei"}, {"authorId": "2294361387", "name": "Yuxuan zhai"}, {"authorId": "2284728569", "name": "Lu Yu"}, {"authorId": "2260606436", "name": "Muhammad Asif Ali"}, {"authorId": "2153121378", "name": "Lijie Hu"}, {"authorId": "2260640875", "name": "Di Wang"}], "citations": []}
