Although such devices are still with limited compute power and resources, they are capable of processing and running pre-trained machine learning models. That is where Edge Machine Learning (Edge ML) comes into play. Edge ML is a technique by which Smart Devices can process data locally (at the device-level) using machine learning algorithms. This reduces the reliance on Cloud computing making decisions faster and on the spot an advantage for security objectives. In this paper, we leverage the Edge ML approach in order to perform traffic analysis as well as system call tracing and monitoring in order to detect the existence of any malicious activity at the edge devices in IoT networks.", "venue": "2023 International Conference On Cyber Management And Engineering (CyMaEn)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-01-26", "journal": {"name": "2023 International Conference On Cyber Management And Engineering (CyMaEn)", "pages": "123-127"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2210227723", "name": "Nathan Pape"}, {"authorId": "2036088", "name": "Christopher Mansour"}], "citations": []}
