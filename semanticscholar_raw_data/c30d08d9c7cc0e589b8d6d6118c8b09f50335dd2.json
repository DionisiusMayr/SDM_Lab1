There are tools within this scope that apply some approximate computation techniques at software computational level. However, these tools are limited in a way that they only cover some specific scope, apply only one of the known techniques and/or need manual code annotations to work out. Thus, this work proposes the implementation of a tool that, according to the application profiling, chooses the most appropriate approximate computing technique to be applied. LLVM-ACT uses the LLVM compilation infrastructure, where each step is implemented as a code analysis or transformation LLVM Pass. The results show that the technique chosen by LLVM-ACT is cost-effective if low error rates and high speedup are taken into account, with an 8x speedup with 22% error rate on average with the Fluidanimate application.", "venue": "Brazilian Symposium on Computing System Engineering", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-11-21", "journal": {"name": "2022 XII Brazilian Symposium on Computing Systems Engineering (SBESC)", "pages": "1-8"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2193024101", "name": "Lavinia Miranda"}, {"authorId": "39882856", "name": "M.
