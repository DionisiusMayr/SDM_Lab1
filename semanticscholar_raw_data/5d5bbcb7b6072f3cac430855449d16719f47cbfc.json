Data centers have poor utilization of CPU and memory, as applications have a varying consumption of these resources that do not always match their varying availability at each server. The problem is that current abstractions for execution\u2014such as tasks, containers, or virtual machines\u2014 have a coarse time granularity and inherently couple computation and state at each server, making it impossible to schedule resources efficiently across servers. We propose new execution abstractions that allow applications to use resources at a finer time granularity without coupling them. Our key idea is to break applications into resource proclets : granular units of execution that dominantly consume a single type of resource and that can split, merge, and migrate across servers to use that resource anywhere in the cluster, even if it is available for only tens of milliseconds, or stranded, such as free memory on a server without spare CPUs. Resource proclets can be combined together into full distributed applications through easy-to-use programming abstractions and an efficient, cluster-wide runtime.", "venue": "", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2155033054", "name": "Ruan"}, {"authorId": "2117840880", "name": "Shihang Li"}, {"authorId": "39596398", "name": "Kai-Wei Fan"}, {"authorId": "145903865", "name": "M.
