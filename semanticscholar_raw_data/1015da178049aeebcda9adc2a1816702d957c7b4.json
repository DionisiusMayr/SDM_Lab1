To achieve this, we convert a random forest (RF) into rules in a Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) format and represent real-world data as a knowledge graph in a Resource Description Framework (RDF) format, capturing the meta-data as part of the model. A rule engine is deployed that applies logical inference on the knowledge graph, resulting in a semantically enriched classification. This new classification is combined with external domain-expert knowledge to provide improved, knowledge-guided assistance for the human-in-the-loop system. A case study in the steel manufacturing domain is introduced, where this application is used for real-world predictive analytic purposes.", "venue": "Applied Sciences", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-11-28", "journal": {"name": "Applied Sciences"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2120216234", "name": "Sadeer Beden"}, {"authorId": "2070464810", "name": "Kayalvizhi Lakshmanan"}, {"authorId": "152680673", "name": "C.
