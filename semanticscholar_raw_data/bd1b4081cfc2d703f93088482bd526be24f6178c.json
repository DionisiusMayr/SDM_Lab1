In this paper, we introduce the design of TACC, a full-stack cloud infrastructure that efficiently manages and executes large-scale machine learning applications in compute clusters. TACC implements a 4-layer application workflow abstraction through which system optimization techniques can be dynamically combined and applied to various types of ML applications. TACC also tailors to the lifecycle of ML applications with an efficient process of managing, deploying, and scaling ML tasks. TACC's design simplifies the process of integrating the latest ML system research work into cloud infrastructures, which we hope will benefit more ML researchers and promote ML system researches.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-10-04", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2110.01556"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2113474190", "name": "Kaiqiang Xu"}, {"authorId": "1870061344", "name": "Xinchen Wan"}, {"authorId": "2144222805", "name": "Hao Wang"}, {"authorId": "2153387737", "name": "Zhenghang Ren"}, {"authorId": "152535697", "name": "Xudong Liao"}, {"authorId": "2148248601", "name": "D.
