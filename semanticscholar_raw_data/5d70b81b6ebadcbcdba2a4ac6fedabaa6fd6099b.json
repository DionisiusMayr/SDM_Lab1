The SCS is fully self-administered, takes about six minutes and measures the function of visual memory, language, and executive function. Participants were instructed to complete SCS tests, gold-standard neuropsychological tests and standardized structural 3T brain MRI.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe Cronbach's alpha was 0.910 of the overall scale, indicating high internal consistency. The SCS total score had an AUC of 0.921 to detect AD (sensitivity\u200a=\u200a0.903, specificity\u200a=\u200a0.945, positive predictive value\u200a=\u200a0.700, negative predictive value\u200a=\u200a0.986, likelihood ratio\u200a=\u200a16.42, number needed for screening utility\u200a=\u200a0.639), and an AUC of 0.838 to detect MCI (sensitivity\u200a=\u200a0.793, specificity\u200a=\u200a0.671, positive predictive value\u200a=\u200a0.657, negative predictive value\u200a=\u200a0.803, likelihood ratio\u200a=\u200a2.41, number needed for screening utility\u200a=\u200a0.944). The subtests demonstrated moderate to high correlations with the gold-standard tests from their respective cognitive domains. The SCS total score and its memory scores all correlated positively with relative volumes of the whole hippocampus and almost all subregions, after controlling for age, sex, and education.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe SCS has good diagnostic accuracy for detecting MCI and AD dementia and has the potential to facilitate large-scale screening in the general community.", "venue": "Journal of Alzheimer's Disease", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-07-18", "journal": {"name": "Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2111399121", "name": "Lin Huang"}, {"authorId": "2111156058", "name": "Yatian Li"}, {"authorId": "2158876762", "name": "Jingnan Wu"}, {"authorId": "2158451824", "name": "Nan Chen"}, {"authorId": "2224131680", "name": "Huanhuan Xia"}, {"authorId": "153683036", "name": "Qihao Guo"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "fdc314364f091bf535cda5d182df7766dc679238", "title": "Exploring the usability of the virtual reality module LEAF CAF\u00c9: a qualitative think-aloud study"}, {"paperId": "6ca19c510392d4bfae268f546f8f845ebbda3e1d", "title": "Consensus on rapid screening for prodromal Alzheimer\u2019s disease in China"}]}
