Query estimation based on simple random samples performs well for simple selection queries; however, return results with extremely high relative errors for complex join queries. Existing methods only work well with foreign key joins, and the sample size can grow dramatically as the dataset gets larger. This research implements a scalable sampling scheme in a big data environment, namely correlated sampling in map-reduce, that can speed up search query length results, give precise join query estimations, and minimize storage costs when presented with big data. Extensive experiments with large TPC-H datasets in Apache Hive show that our sampling method produces fast and accurate query estimations on big data.", "venue": "International Conference on Software Engineering", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2019-09-26", "journal": {"name": "", "pages": "41-50", "volume": "64"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "153112404", "name": "David Wilson"}, {"authorId": "1712441", "name": "W.
