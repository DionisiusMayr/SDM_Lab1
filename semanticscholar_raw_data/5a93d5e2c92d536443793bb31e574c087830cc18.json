GraphQL is a query language for graph-structured Web APIs, increasingly popular among Web developers and recently explored as an alternative query language for Linked Data and its underlying RDF data model. However, to date, the deployment of available GraphQL processors for RDF data requires users to have intricate knowledge of Semantic Web technologies, such as SPARQL and SHACL, as well as the schema of the underlying RDF data.We present Ultra-GraphQL ( UGQL ), an open source tool enabling the automatic bootstrapping of GraphQL endpoints for existing RDF triple stores, based on an adaptable SPARQL schema extraction, mapping and query translation approach. By automatically generating CRUD mutations for each object type, UGQL further enables write access to RDF data. UGQL thus allows developers with limited or no knowledge of Semantic Web technologies to read and write RDF data using plain GraphQL, eliminating dependencies on third-party schema de\ufb01nitions. By effectively lowering the entry barrier for working with Linked Data, it has the potential to be a ground-breaker for Semantic Web technologies.", "venue": "ASLD@ISWC", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"pages": "119-134"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "31648495", "name": "L.
