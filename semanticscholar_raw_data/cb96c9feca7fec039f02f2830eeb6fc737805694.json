Governments, large corporations, startups, open data initiatives and other organizations are using RDF as a data model with the purpose of sharing information and knowledge in several domains. In such scenario, scalability is the main issue for virtually all the recently proposed triplestores. Thus, many triplestores are employing NoSQL databases on their storage layers. In this paper we present a survey about mapping strategies for storing RDF data into NoSQL databases. Most of them considers the query response as the main measure for the quality of the approach. Thus, the impact of the mapping design is hidden behind optimization, partitioning and indexing issues. The main contribution of this survey is to discuss the benefits and disadvantages of each strategy.", "venue": "ACM Symposium on Applied Computing", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2020-03-29", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 35th Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2571332", "name": "L.
