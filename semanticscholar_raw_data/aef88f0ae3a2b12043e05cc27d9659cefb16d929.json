The driving goal of our research, over the past half decade, has been to make it easy for individuals and teams\u2014regardless of programming or analysis expertise\u2014manage, analyze, make sense of, and draw insights from large datasets. In this article, we re\ufb02ect on a comprehensive suite of tools that we\u2019ve been building to empower everyone to perform data science more ef\ufb01ciently and effortlessly, including D ATA S PREAD , a scalable sp-readsheet tool that combines the bene\ufb01ts of spreadsheets and databases, and Z EN V ISAGE , a visual exploration tool that accelerates the discovery of trends or patterns. Our tools have been developed in collaboration with experts in various disciplines, including neuroscience, battery science, genomics, astrophysics, and ad analytics. We will discuss some of the key technical challenges underlying the development of these tools, and how we addressed them, drawing from ideas in multiple disciplines. In the process, we will outline a research agenda for tool development to empower every-one to tap into the hidden potential in their datasets at scale.", "venue": "Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2019-08-01", "journal": {"name": "Proc.
