Different online learning platforms have accumulated a large number of fine granularity records of students\u2019 learning behavior, which provides us with an excellent opportunity to analyze students\u2019 learning behavior. In this paper, based on the behavior log data in four consecutive years of blended learning in a college\u2019s programming course, we propose a novel multiclassification frame to predict students\u2019 learning outcomes. First, the data obtained from diverse platforms, i.e., MOOC, Cnblogs, Programming Teaching Assistant (PTA) system, and Rain Classroom, are integrated and preprocessed. Second, a novel error-correcting output codes (ECOC) multiclassification framework, based on genetic algorithm (GA) and ternary bitwise calculator, is designed to effectively predict the grade levels of students by optimizing the code-matrix, feature subset, and binary classifiers of ECOC. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm in this paper significantly outperforms other alternatives in predicting students\u2019 grades. In addition, the performance of the algorithm can be further improved by adding the grades of prerequisite courses.", "venue": "Scientific Programming", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-09-11", "journal": {"name": "Sci.
