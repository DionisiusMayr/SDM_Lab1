While data placement strategies have significant influence on the I/O performance, the traditional one-layout-fits-all strategy fails to make optimal decisions and could not utilize hierarchical storage architecture efficiently. Some strategies based on user hints cannot meet the demand of data explosion. Although recent efforts propose several adaptive data placement techniques, fitting diverse scientific workflows and complex system characteristics are still challenging. This paper presents WorkflowRL, an intelligent data placement engine that utilizes reinforcement learning to manage data across multi-layer hierarchical storage system. WorkflowRL extracts factors affecting the I/O performance including the workflow characteristics and system information for feature learning. Then, it interacts with the heterogeneous storage system environment to make optimal data placement decisions. Extensive experiments have been conducted and the results have demonstrated that our data placement strategy can significantly improve the I/O performance with diverse scientific workflows.", "venue": "International Conference on Innovative Computing and Cloud Computing", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2020-12-11", "journal": {"name": "2020 IEEE 6th International Conference on Computer and Communications (ICCC)", "pages": "2023-2027"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2154042101", "name": "Weixuan Shi"}, {"authorId": "153719842", "name": "Peng Cheng"}, {"authorId": "2049409986", "name": "Chi Zhu"}, {"authorId": "7711823", "name": "Zhiguang Chen"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "35d13a1a51e2915d317c299fa34c108296e078d6", "title": "A survey on AI for storage"}, {"paperId": "ec3945a9a86995d1894f4d086c7912ede050c3ec", "title": "Placement Approach for the Data Storage Management Function in a RAN-CN Converged Network"}, {"paperId": "4187f62c2f19f82d626eb1d2baf12345fc3dca3a", "title": "Efficient Prefetching and Client-Side Caching Algorithms for Improving the Performance of Read Operations in Distributed File Systems"}]}
