There have been many works on the exploration and adoption of these techniques in recent years. However, a number of engines still refrain from adopting them because of some reasons. One of the common reasons claims that the intricacies of these techniques make engines too complex to maintain. Another major barrier is the lack of widely accepted architectures and libraries of these techniques, which leads to the adoption often starting from scratch with lots of effort. In this paper, we propose Intel Big Data Analytic Toolkit (BDTK), an open-source C++ acceleration toolkit library for analytical data processing engines. BDTK provides lightweight, easy-to-connect, reusable components with interoperable interfaces to support query compilation and hardware accelerators. The query compilation in BDTK leverages vectorized execution and data-centric code generation to achieve high performance. BDTK could be integrated into different engines and helps them to adapt query compilation and hardware accelerators to optimize performance bottlenecks with less engineering effort.", "venue": "Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-08-01", "journal": {"name": "Proc.
