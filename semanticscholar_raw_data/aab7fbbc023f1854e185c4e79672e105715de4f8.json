RBC minimizes the number of write-stalls and reduces tail latency by precisely measuring the requests for solid-state disk bandwidth from various components within the LSM-tree. We have successfully implemented RBC on the state-of-the-art LSM-tree storage system, RocksDB. The experimental results show that using YSCB to evaluate RBC leads to a significant decrease in write-stalls and tail latency. Additionally, RBC provides higher write throughput (up to 1.52x) and high read throughput (up to 1.96x), while reducing read and write amplification by 55% and 37%, respectively. Furthermore, we observed a reduction of approximately 50% in tail latency with the use of RBC.", "venue": "International Conference on Parallel Processing", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-08-07", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 52nd International Conference on Parallel Processing"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2239403531", "name": "Zepeng Wang"}, {"authorId": "2151229750", "name": "Shu Yin"}], "citations": []}
