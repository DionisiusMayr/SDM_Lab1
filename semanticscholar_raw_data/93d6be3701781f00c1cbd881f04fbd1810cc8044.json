Our work focuses on the service discovery model (HBSD) using Hadoop that leads to the challenges of automatic web service discovery patterns. It has been observed that the RDBMS can handle only data sizes up to a few Terabytes but fails to scale beyond that, so Apache Hadoop can be used for parallel processing of massive datasets. This article provides a novel Hadoop based Service Discovery (HBSD) approach that can handle vast amount of datasets generated from heterogeneous cloud services. The novelty of the proposed architecture coordinates cloud participants, automate service registration pattern, reconfigure discover services and focus on aggregating heterogeneous services from Inter-cloud environments. Moreover, this particle states a novel and efficient algorithm (HBSDMCA) for finding the appropriate service as per user's requirements that can provide higher QoS to the user request for web services.", "venue": "International Journal of Information Technology and Web Engineering", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2019-07-01", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Information Technology and Web Engineering"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "40568338", "name": "G.
