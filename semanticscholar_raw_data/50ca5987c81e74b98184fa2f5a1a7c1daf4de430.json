The aim of this study was to stratify a treatment na\u00efve paediatric IBD cohort through specific innate immunity pathway profiling and application of unsupervised machine learning (UML).\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn order to test the molecular integrity of biological pathways implicated in IBD, innate immune responses were assessed at diagnosis in 22 paediatric patients and 10 age-matched controls. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were selectively stimulated for assessing the functionality of upstream activation receptors including NOD2, toll-like receptor (TLR) 1-2 and TLR4, and the downstream cytokine responses (IL-10, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 & TNF-\u03b1) using multiplex assays. Cytokine data generated were subjected to hierarchical clustering to assess for patient stratification.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCombined immune responses in patients across twelve effector responses were significantly reduced compared to controls (p\u200a=\u200a0.003) and driven primarily by 'hypofunctional' TLR responses (p values 0.045, 0.010 & 0.018 for TLR4-mediated IL-10, IL-1\u03b2 & TNF-\u03b1 respectively; 0.018 & 0.015 for TLR1-2 -mediated IL-10 & IL-1\u03b2). Hierarchical clustering generated three distinct clusters of patients and a fourth group of 'unclustered' individuals. No relationship was observed between the observed immune clusters and the clinical disease phenotype.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAlthough a clinically useful outcome was not observed through hierarchical clustering, our study provides a rationale for using an UML approach to stratify patients. The study also highlights the predominance of hypo-inflammatory innate immune responses as a key mechanism in the pathogenesis of IBD.", "venue": "Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition - JPGN", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-04-03", "journal": {"name": "Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology & Nutrition"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "39022278", "name": "T.
