In the field of firms' default prediction, however, the lack of interpretability has prevented the extensive adoption of the black-box type of models. To overcome this drawback and maintain the high performances of black-boxes, this paper relies on a model-agnostic approach. Accumulated Local Effects and Shapley values are used to shape the predictors' impact on the likelihood of default and rank them according to their contribution to the model outcome. Prediction is achieved by two Machine Learning algorithms (eXtreme Gradient Boosting and FeedForward Neural Network) compared with three standard discriminant models. Results show that our analysis of the Italian Small and Medium Enterprises manufacturing industry benefits from the overall highest classification power by the eXtreme Gradient Boosting algorithm without giving up a rich interpretation framework.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics", "Economics"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-08-31", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2108.13914"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2824277", "name": "Lisa Crosato"}, {"authorId": "2824957", "name": "C.
