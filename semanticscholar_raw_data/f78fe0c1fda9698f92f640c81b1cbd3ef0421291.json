This paper provides a thorough analysis of the different studies that have been conducted on workflow scheduling in cloud computing in last ten years. A thorough statistical analysis is provided in this review which was conducted by extracting specific information from 59 papers published between the years 2010 and 2020. Moreover, a classification of the proposed methods based on the type of scheduling algorithm applied in each scheme is presented. Finally, future direction in the domain of workflow scheduling in cloud is stated.", "venue": "International Conference on Communications, Computing, Cybersecurity, and Informatics", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2020-11-03", "journal": {"name": "2020 International Conference on Communications, Computing, Cybersecurity, and Informatics (CCCI)", "pages": "1-5"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2000971915", "name": "D.
