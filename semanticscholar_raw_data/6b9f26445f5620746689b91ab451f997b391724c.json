The big successes of big data analytics in diverse areas over the past decade have also prompted the expectation of big data and its efficacy on the big problem\u2014climate change. As an emerging topic, climate change has been at the forefront of the big climate data analytics implementations and exhaustive research have been carried out covering a variety of topics. This paper aims to present an outlook of big data in climate change studies over the recent years by investigating and summarising the current status of big data applications in climate change related studies. It is also expected to serve as a one-stop reference directory for researchers and stakeholders with an overview of this trending subject at a glance, which can be useful in guiding future research and improvements in the exploitation of big climate data.", "venue": "Big Data and Cognitive Computing", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2019-02-02", "journal": {"name": "Big Data Cogn.
