This paper proposes improved density peaks clustering based on natural neighbor expanded group (DPC-NNEG). The cores of the proposed algorithm contain two parts: (1) define natural neighbor expanded (NNE) and natural neighbor expanded group (NNEG) and (2) divide all NNEGs into a goal number of sets as the final clustering result, according to the closeness degree of NNEGs. At the same time, the paper provides the measurement of the closeness degree. We compared the state of the art with our proposal in public datasets, including several complex and real datasets. Experiments show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm.", "venue": "Complex", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-10-16", "journal": {"name": "Complex.", "pages": "8864239:1-8864239:11", "volume": "2020"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2117199851", "name": "Lin Ding"}, {"authorId": "47210353", "name": "Weihong Xu"}, {"authorId": "7376925", "name": "Yuantao Chen"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "3a0fab327f68f49a2108db60fdeb81be3eb876fc", "title": "Constrained Density Peak Clustering"}, {"paperId": "7c2d94c3fa566f59434db0246a19a309ffd08216", "title": "An overview on density peaks clustering"}, {"paperId": "ed85d1050e28a228301ea81034008a98e46e2da5", "title": "An improved density peaks clustering algorithm based on natural neighbor with a merging strategy"}, {"paperId": "504373927d74c023e01da65f042e7584347f62aa", "title": "Adaptive Mixed-Attribute Data Clustering Method Based on Density Peaks"}, {"paperId": "cdef3474986044116ae5861a3a50bef1a60edb5d", "title": "An improved local binary pattern method for pollen image classification and recognition"}]}
