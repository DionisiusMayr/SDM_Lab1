Geospatial big data refers to handling of spatial data sets beyond the capacity of standard computing systems. This paper focuses on the two game changing technologies in the oil palm industry; the Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) and the Internet of Things (IoT). The big data generated by these uprising technologies will revolutionise the oil palm industry towards the true implementation of oil palm precision agriculture. This paper elaborates the key challenges and opportunities as Sime Darby Plantation is moving towards the operationalisation of geospatial big data analytics.", "venue": "", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "100470385", "name": "Mohd.
