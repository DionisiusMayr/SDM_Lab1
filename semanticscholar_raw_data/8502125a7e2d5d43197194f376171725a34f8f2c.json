Generally, in smart cities where distributed things have access to computational resources, data transfer becomes inevitable because of high latency, thereby resulting in crucial situations. Even though numerous technologies have emerged for improving the data communication among geo\u2010distributed devices received from the cloud server but still, it lags in low learning performance. To address these challenges, an innovative artificial intelligence (AI) based edge node (E\u2010Node) algorithm is implemented to optimize the edge to edge learning for well\u2010organized data migration. To attain high reliability, AI\u2010K\u2010means neural network (KNN) and convolution neural network (CNN) is used initially for pre\u2010processing and filtering the edge node. Further, the proposed E\u2010Node algorithm outperforms the optimization technique effectively through the edge to edge computing The reliability performance is increased by reducing the node optimization time from 132 to 98\u2009ms for 25\u2009kb data and data transmission time is reduced from 93 to 45\u2009ms for 80\u2009kb data, thus reducing the latency in an edge envisioned environment.", "venue": "Transactions on Emerging Telecommunications Technologies", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-09-16", "journal": {"name": "Transactions on Emerging Telecommunications Technologies", "volume": "32"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2112128693", "name": "Visvam Devadoss Ambeth Kumar"}, {"authorId": "2136071300", "name": "Abhishek Kumar"}, {"authorId": "41131001", "name": "R.
