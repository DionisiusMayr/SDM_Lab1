By now, we have quite fast algorithms---usually sublogarithmic-time and often poly(\u0142og\u0142og n)-time, or even faster---for a number of fundamental graph problems in the massively parallel computation (MPC) model. This model is a widely-adopted theoretical abstraction of MapReduce style settings, where a number of machines communicate in an all-to-all manner to process large-scale data. Contributing to this line of work on MPC graph algorithms, we present poly(\u0142og k) \u03b5 poly(\u0142og\u0142og n) round MPC algorithms for computing O(k^1+o(1) )-spanners in the strongly sublinear regime of local memory. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first sublogarithmic-time MPC algorithms for spanner construction. As primary applications of our spanners, we get two important implications, as follows: -For the MPC setting, we get an O(\u0142og^2\u0142og n)-round algorithm for O(\u0142og^1+o(1) n) approximation of all pairs shortest paths (APSP) in the near-linear regime of local memory. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first sublogarithmic-time MPC algorithm for distance approximations. -Our result above also extends to the Congested Clique model of distributed computing, with the same round complexity and approximation guarantee. This gives the first sub-logarithmic algorithm for approximating APSP in weighted graphs in the Congested Clique model.", "venue": "ACM Symposium on Parallelism in Algorithms and Architectures", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2020-03-02", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 33rd ACM Symposium on Parallelism in Algorithms and Architectures"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2115477", "name": "Amartya Shankha Biswas"}, {"authorId": "21230419", "name": "Michal Dory"}, {"authorId": "1772752", "name": "M.
