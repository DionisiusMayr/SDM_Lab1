In this paper, we present CopAS, a system targeted at Big Data forensics analysis, allowing network operators to comfortably analyze and correlate large amounts of network data to get insights about potentially malicious and suspicious events. We demonstrate the practical usage of CopAS for insider attack detection on a publicly available PCAP dataset and show how the system can be used to detect insiders hiding their malicious activity in the large amounts of data streams generated during the operations of an organization within the network.", "venue": "International Conference on Internet of Things, Big Data and Security", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-12-09", "journal": {"pages": "150-161"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "103774486", "name": "M.
