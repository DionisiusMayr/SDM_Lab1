However, data analyses can often provide better insight when data from several sources is integrated into a combined perspective. In this paper we present an overview of our data integration system DataCalc. DataCalc is an extensible integration platform that executes adhoc analytical queries on a set of heterogeneous data processors. Our novel platform uses an expressive function shipping interface that promotes local computation and reduces data movement between processors. In this paper, we provide a discussion of the overall architecture and the main components of DataCalc. Moreover, we discuss the cost of integrating additional processors and evaluate the overall performance of the platform.", "venue": "2019 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2019-12-01", "journal": {"name": "2019 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "pages": "463-468"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3469702", "name": "Johannes Luong"}, {"authorId": "1694689", "name": "Dirk Habich"}, {"authorId": "7337091", "name": "Wolfgang Lehner"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "898ec8666572418dbb94a1280d18805432db8fbe", "title": "A Technical Perspective of DataCalc \u2014 Ad-hoc Analyses on Heterogeneous Data Sources"}]}
