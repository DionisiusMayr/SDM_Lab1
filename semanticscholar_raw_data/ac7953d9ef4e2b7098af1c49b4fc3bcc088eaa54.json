However, in these economies the industry is characterized by limited technological infrastructure, which has led to inefficient performance and the significant generation of water, material, and product waste through its supply chain (SC). Currently, Industry 4.0 has led to important benefits in manufacturing industries, but its application in the textile field has been limited to few case studies. The present work expands on this aspect with a critical review of Industry 4.0 concepts and principles, and our main contribution consists of an implementation guideline model. The model was based on Six Sigma and the Rothwell and Zegveld model for continuous improvement and innovation projects in manufacturing and business enterprises. In each step, key aspects such as the specific skills of the interdisciplinary team, assessment tools, and implementation/prototyping tools are highlighted. A discussion of a case study is presented to support the applicability of the model for Industry 4.0 pilot projects.", "venue": "Sustainability", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-08-19", "journal": {"name": "Sustainability"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1403082226", "name": "S.
