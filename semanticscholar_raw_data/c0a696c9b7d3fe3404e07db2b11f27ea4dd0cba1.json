Swim builds a running application from streaming events, creating a distributed dataflow graph of linked, stateful, concurrent streaming actors that is overlaid on a mesh of runtime instances. Streaming actors are vertices in the dataflow graph that concurrently analyze new events and modify their states. A link is an edge in the graph and is a URI binding to an actor's streaming API. The Swim runtime streams every actor state change over its links to other (possibly remote) actors using op-based CRDTs that asynchronously update remotely cached actor state replicas. This frees local actors to compute at any time, using the latest replicas of remote state. Actors evaluate parametric functions, including geospatial, analytical, and predictive, to discover new relationships and forge or break links, dynamically adapting the dataflow graph to model the changing real-world. Swim applications are tiny, robust and resource efficient, and remain effortlessly in-sync with the real-world, analyzing, learning, and predicting on-the-fly.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-05-20", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2205.10458"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "8062525", "name": "C.
