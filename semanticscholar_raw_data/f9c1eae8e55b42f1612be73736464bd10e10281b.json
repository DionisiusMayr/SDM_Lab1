In order to offer people with efficient, quiet driving and a life free of pollutants, traffic regulation becomes more essential. The work is intended to create a system in which all modules are connected to a single control unit that can control, detect, and report any system faults as well as to develop a single module that can improve the efficiency of vehicle transportation on roads, control energy-efficient LED street lights, and design a module that can detect emergency vehicles and alert other vehicles on the road so that emergency vehicles can arrive at their destination in time.", "venue": "2023 9th International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communication Systems (ICACCS)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-03-17", "journal": {"name": "2023 9th International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communication Systems (ICACCS)", "pages": "1845-1850", "volume": "1"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "9225573", "name": "S.
