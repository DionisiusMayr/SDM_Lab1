This study aims to answer the extent to which administrative decisions issued during exceptional circumstances are legitimate. The study concluded that administrative actions under the theory of exceptional necessity and according to its conditions do not constitute a demolition of the principle of legality or a violation of the system, regardless of the severity of the violation. Instead, it is an action that serves the public interest and preserves the constitution and entity of the state. The study also recommended that administrative bodies must prove the existence of genuine and documented exceptional circumstances justifying the application of the necessity theory, avoiding its use without convincing reasons, and applying it with wisdom and caution.\u00a0", "venue": "International Journal of Religion", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-03-20", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Religion"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2286418979", "name": "Khalid Ali Y.
