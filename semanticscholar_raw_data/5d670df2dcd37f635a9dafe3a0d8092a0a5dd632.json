Without radical structural change or managerial system changes, leaders face dilemmas: simply bolting on big data makes little difference. This study is based on a qualitative empirical case study using data collected from the cities of Helsinki and Tampere in Finland. The three core dilemma pairs detected and connected to the big data-related organisational changes are: (1) repetitive continuity vs. visionary change, (2) risk-taking vs. security-seeking and (3) technology-based development vs. human-based development. This study suggests that organisational readiness involves not only capabilities; instead, readiness involves absorbing knowledge, making decisions, handling ambiguities, managing dilemmas. Thus, big data-related transformations in public organisations require embracing the world of dilemmas, since selected and cancelled experiments may each have valuable outcomes. The capability to act on intentions is a prerequisite for readiness; however, a preparedness to detect and address dilemmas is central to big data-related transformations. Thus, the ability to make dilemma decisions is a more complicated characteristic of readiness. In conclusion, our data analysis suggests that traditional public organisational and chance management approaches produce unsolved dilemmas in big data-related organisational changes.", "venue": "", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Political Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2019-12-01", "journal": {"name": "NISPAcee Journal of Public Administration and Policy", "pages": "131 - 156", "volume": "12"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "114838346", "name": "P\u00e4ivikki Kuoppakangas"}, {"authorId": "143635664", "name": "T.
