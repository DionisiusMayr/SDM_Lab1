Recent years, the prominent effect of CoT prompting has attracted emerging research. However, there still lacks of a systematic summary about key factors of CoT prompting and comprehensive guide for prompts utilizing. For a deeper understanding about CoT prompting, we survey on a wide range of current research, presenting a systematic and comprehensive analysis on several factors that may influence the effect of CoT prompting, and introduce how to better apply it in different applications under these discussions. We further analyze the challenges and propose some future directions about CoT prompting. This survey could provide an overall reference on related research.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-10-08", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2310.04959"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2257083891", "name": "Zihan Yu"}, {"authorId": "2257338987", "name": "Liang He"}, {"authorId": "2146267846", "name": "Zhen Wu"}, {"authorId": "2257010530", "name": "Xinyu Dai"}, {"authorId": "1838162", "name": "Jiajun Chen"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "c108a2fa4bd74178e72d2dff135fecb815dad299", "title": "PreConfig: A Pretrained Model for Automating Network Configuration"}, {"paperId": "e53412b4f0f15330f8efa84e3c8f649bbe5e26f7", "title": "An Empirical Categorization of Prompting Techniques for Large Language Models: A Practitioner's Guide"}, {"paperId": "396ea10d3ab89da41d02693d7165c4b98ecbb5f3", "title": "Puzzle Solving using Reasoning of Large Language Models: A Survey"}, {"paperId": "4243f5e3e2fb405aba2648512eb950c06a4fd900", "title": "Assessing the Reasoning Abilities of ChatGPT in the Context of Claim Verification"}, {"paperId": "48c0538d902a2620d0c3538e6ed3cf3062d656c3", "title": "GuReT: Distinguishing Guilt and Regret related Text"}, {"paperId": "35c369aef262cb5dd216f18b204952a42a2b95f8", "title": "The Tyranny of Possibilities in the Design of Task-Oriented LLM Systems: A Scoping Survey"}, {"paperId": "f5c56acf0aec4b2627c6f22020ac196d9e129b32", "title": "Beyond Isolation: Multi-Agent Synergy for Improving Knowledge Graph Construction"}, {"paperId": "6fa0677731184444df0e1fc8070938419cd6da47", "title": "Igniting Language Intelligence: The Hitchhiker's Guide From Chain-of-Thought Reasoning to Language Agents"}, {"paperId": "ee5e79a83b019d5a7e3ad55e6e39696aff67a5f2", "title": "Combating Misinformation in the Age of LLMs: Opportunities and Challenges"}, {"paperId": "11a4284e335ba39330b59d9f42ca3272a6166991", "title": "A Survey of Chain of Thought Reasoning: Advances, Frontiers and Future"}]}
