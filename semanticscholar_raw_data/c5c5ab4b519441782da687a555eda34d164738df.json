We have developed artificial intelligence\u2013based computer-assisted diagnosis (CADx) for an existing low-cost portable ultrasound system to triage which lumps need further evaluation and which are clearly benign. This pilot study was conducted to demonstrate that this approach can be successfully used by minimally trained health care workers in an LMIC country. Patients and Methods We recruited and trained three nonradiologist health care workers to participate in an institutional review board\u2013approved, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act\u2013compliant pilot study in Jalisco, Mexico, to determine whether they could use portable ultrasound (GE Vscan Dual Probe) to acquire images of palpable breast lumps of adequate quality for accurate computer analysis. Images from 32 women with 32 breast masses were then analyzed with a triage-CADx system, generating an output of benign or suspicious (biopsy recommended). Triage-CADx outputs were compared with radiologist readings. Results The nonradiologists were able to acquire adequate images. Triage by the CADx software was as accurate as assessment by specialist radiologists, with two (100%) of two cancers considered suspicious and 30 (100%) of 30 benign lesions classified as benign. Conclusion A portable ultrasound system with CADx software can be successfully used by first-level health care workers to triage palpable breast lumps. These results open up the possibility of implementing practical, cost-effective triage of palpable breast lumps, ensuring that scarce resources can be dedicated to suspicious lesions requiring further workup.", "venue": "Journal of Global Oncology", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2018-08-29", "journal": {"name": "Journal of Global Oncology", "volume": "4"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1919400", "name": "S.
