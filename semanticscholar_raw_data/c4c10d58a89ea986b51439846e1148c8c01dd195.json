Starting from an n-dimensional space (with n \u2265 7) represented by problem variables (referred to as CSF\u2014Critical Success Factors), a dimensional embedding procedure is used to transition to a two-dimensional space. In the two-dimensional space, thanks to new lattice motion algorithms, the decision support system can determine the optimal solution with a lower computational cost based on the decision-maker\u2019s preferences. Finally, thanks to an algorithm that takes into account the hierarchical order of importance of the seven CSFs as per the expert\u2019s liking or according to his optimization logics, a return is made to the n-dimensional space and the final solution in the original space. As we will see, the starting and ending states in the n-dimensional space (referred to as micro-states) when projected into the two-dimensional space generate states (referred to as macro-states) which are degenerate. In other words, the correspondence between micro-states and macro-states is not one-to-one, as multiple micro-states correspond to one macro-state. Therefore, in relation to the decision-maker\u2019s preferences, it will be the responsibility of the decision support system to provide the decision-maker with the micro-state of interest in the n-dimensional space (dimensional emergence procedure), starting from the obtained optimal macro-state. This result can be achieved starting from a flat chain of sensors capable of measuring/emulating certain specific parameters of interest. As we will see, it emerges that by considering random\u2013exhaustive rolling value paths in order to track and potentially intervene to rebalance a dynamic system representing the state of stress/sensing of a system of interest, we are using the most general and, therefore, complex hypotheses of ergodic theory. In this work, we will focus on the representation of information in n-dimensional and two-dimensional spaces, as well as construct evaluation scenarios. We will also show the results of the decision support system in some cases of specific interest, thanks to a specific lattice motion algorithm of the realized decision-making environment.", "venue": "Applied Sciences", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-03-12", "journal": {"name": "Applied Sciences"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2291216388", "name": "Gerardo Iovane"}, {"authorId": "2269274118", "name": "Marta Chinnici"}], "citations": []}
