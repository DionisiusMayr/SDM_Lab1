It performs real time object property identification and stores all data in a scalable DBMS. Standing queries implemented as database triggers are supported. SurvQ contains novel adaptive machine learning and algorithmic property classification. The application of SurvQ to assist the West Lafayette (IN) police department at identifying suspects in video is described. This paper also describes the basics of the SurvQ architecture and its human-in-the-loop interface designed to accelerate everyday police investigations.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "145345023", "name": "M.
