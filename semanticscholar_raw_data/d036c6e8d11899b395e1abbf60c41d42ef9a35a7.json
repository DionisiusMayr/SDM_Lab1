Issues on SFC is SF allocation to a VM and to minimize the response time and number of function instances. In this paper, we propose an SF clustering-based scheduling algorithm, called \u201cSF-clustering for utilizing virtual CPUs\u201d (SF-CUV), to solve the SF allocation and SF selection problems simultaneously. Experimental results show that SF-CUV can utilize vCPUs to minimize the response time.", "venue": "", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2019-08-29", "journal": {"name": "", "pages": "1-4", "volume": "119"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "66637890", "name": "Kanemitsu Hidehiro"}, {"authorId": "66511094", "name": "Kanai Kenji"}, {"authorId": "52065156", "name": "Katto Jiro"}, {"authorId": "1903805", "name": "Nakazato Hidenori"}], "citations": []}
