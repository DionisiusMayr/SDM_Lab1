The paper presents the survey on the data mining algorithms and the techniques that could be employed with the intelligent computing system, presenting a basic conception of the data mining along with the prominent algorithms of the data mining and the classification of its techniques, further the survey concludes with the challenges included in the overview of the survey done along with the future enhancement in the research that analyses the data mining techniques in the intelligent computing applications.", "venue": "Journal of Trends in Computer Science and Smart Technology", "year": 2019,
