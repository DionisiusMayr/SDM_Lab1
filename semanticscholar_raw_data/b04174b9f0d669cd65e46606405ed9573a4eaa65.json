IoT has made a big contribution to a variety of software programs. The rapid proliferation of smart devices, as well as their trust in data transfer and the use of Wi-Fi mechanics, has increased their vulnerability to cyber-attacks. As a result, the cost of cybercrime is rising every day. As a result, investigating IoT security threats and possible countermeasures can assist researchers in creating acceptable ways to deal with a variety of stressful scenarios in cybercrime research. The IoT framework, as well as IoT architecture, protocols, and technology, are all covered in this assessment research. Various protection issues at each tier, as well as correction strategies, are also detailed. In addition, this article discusses the use of IoT forensics in cybercrime investigations in a variety of areas, including cybercrime research, Artificial intelligence, system learning, cloud computing, fog computing, and blockchain technology all play a role in this discussion. Finally, some open research on challenging situations in IoT is detailed to enhance cybercrime investigations, providing a cutting-edge course for future research.", "venue": "J.
