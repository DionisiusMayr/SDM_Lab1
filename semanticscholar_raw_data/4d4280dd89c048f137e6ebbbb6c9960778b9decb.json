This study investigates the usage of LLMs among 1,500 representative US citizens. Remarkably, 42% of participants reported utilizing an LLM. Our findings reveal a gender gap in LLM technology adoption (more male users than female users) with complex interaction patterns regarding age. Technology-related education eliminates the gender gap in our sample. Moreover, expert users are more likely than novices to list professional tasks as typical application scenarios, suggesting discrepancies in effective usage at the workplace. These results underscore the importance of providing education in artificial intelligence in our technology-driven society to promote equitable access to and benefits from LLMs. We urge for both international replication beyond the US and longitudinal observation of adoption.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-10-10", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2310.06556"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1396850289", "name": "Fiona Draxler"}, {"authorId": "1768653", "name": "Daniel Buschek"}, {"authorId": "151139561", "name": "Mikke Tavast"}, {"authorId": "35224558", "name": "Perttu H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen"}, {"authorId": "2257009988", "name": "Albrecht Schmidt"}, {"authorId": "2257001282", "name": "Juhi Kulshrestha"}, {"authorId": "2247922398", "name": "Robin Welsch"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "dfe66446a3cee5477f04a8bed035975c1ab70743", "title": "Simulating the Human in HCD with ChatGPT: Redesigning Interaction Design with AI"}]}
