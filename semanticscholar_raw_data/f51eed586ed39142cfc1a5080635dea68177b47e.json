However, managing the information and extracting knowledge from it is the most challenging and problematic. Thus, this paper proposed a template-centric new Data Acquisition (DAQ) methodology. The stock market data is gathered from several structured or unstructured data sources. After the DAQ criterion, templates are created for the gathered data. The stock market data is collected grounded on its Application Programming Interface (API) and transmitted via the transmission protocols during the DAQ process. To effectively remove redundant data, the transmitted data is pre-processed and stored efficiently in the network for further real-time analysis. Finally, the proposed technique\u2019s performance is evaluated. As per the experimental and empirical evaluation, the proposed system surpasses the other methods.", "venue": "International Journal of Innovative Technology and Exploring Engineering", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2023-02-28", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Innovative Technology and Exploring Engineering"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2150706716", "name": "S.
