The GOA is meticulously structured with two distinctive phases, namely, exploration and exploitation, drawing inspiration from the strategic dynamics and player conduct observed in the sport of golf. Through comprehensive assessments encompassing fifty-two objective functions and four real-world engineering applications, the efficacy of the GOA is rigorously examined. The results of the optimization process reveal GOA\u2019s exceptional proficiency in both exploration and exploitation strategies, effectively striking a harmonious equilibrium between the two. Comparative analyses against ten competing algorithms demonstrate a clear and statistically significant superiority of the GOA across a spectrum of performance metrics. Furthermore, the successful application of the GOA to the intricate energy commitment problem, considering network resilience, underscores its prowess in addressing complex engineering challenges. For the convenience of the research community, we provide the MATLAB implementation codes for the proposed GOA methodology, ensuring accessibility and facilitating further exploration.", "venue": "Biomimetics", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-08-24", "journal": {"name": "Biomimetics", "volume": "8"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "40799648", "name": "Z.
