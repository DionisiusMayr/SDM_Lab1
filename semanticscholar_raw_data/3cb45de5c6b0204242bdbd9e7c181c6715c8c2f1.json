This study will attempt to forecast students\u2019 intelligence quotients or academic grades to measure the IQ of a student in a holistic manner using all kinds of parameters, from students\u2019 academic records to input from their professors and even their family background, thus creating a dataset of 9000 instances with all these data. We implemented and trained multiple machine learning algorithms on the data and collected the outcomes to select the best algorithm. Students\u2019 quantitative reasoning ability was selected as a parameter that could be assessed by their performance on aptitude tests. Certifications of the student during their bachelor\u2019s degree have been considered, which would also give us an idea about the student\u2019s critical and logical thinking ability. All the parameters were rated on a scale of 1-10. The driving motivation behind this investigation was to discover what parameters force a student to be placed in a company then the final overall \u201cstudent score\u201d is calculated to determine a student\u2019s intelligence quotient. The final IQ score of the student-generated was graded on a scale of 0-3 and a suitable salary package range for the student was estimated giving the company a good idea of the student\u2019s capability.", "venue": "IEEE Access", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "IEEE Access", "pages": "1-1", "volume": "PP"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2164408725", "name": "Nikhila Kathirisetty"}, {"authorId": "117691911", "name": "R.
