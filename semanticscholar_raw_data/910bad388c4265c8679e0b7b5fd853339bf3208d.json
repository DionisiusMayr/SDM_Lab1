In this paper, we modeled a SLA based workflow scheduling algorithm\u00a0 focuses on minimization of makespan and SLA violations. This algorithm developed using Harris hawks optimization. Experimentation carried out using workflowsim. Random workload fed as input to algorithm and it is evaluated against existing baseline approaches and simulation results revealed that our proposed approach minimizes makespan and SLA violations over existing approaches by 40% and 43% respectively.", "venue": "ICST Transactions on Scalable Information Systems", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-09-28", "journal": {"name": "ICST Transactions on Scalable Information Systems"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2092414962", "name": "S.
