Such a computation can be used for ZIP code-based target marketing as one of the smart city applications. A na\u00efve approach to this computation is the usage of the distance between ZIP codes. We redefine a distance metric combining the centroid distance with the intersecting road network between ZIP codes by using a weighted sum method. Furthermore, we prove that the results of our combined approach conform to the characteristics of distance measurement. We have proposed a general and heuristic approach for computing Ad-Hoc proximity, while for computing Top-K proximity, we have proposed a general approach only. Our experimental results indicate that our approaches are verifiable and effective in reducing the execution time and search space.", "venue": "Italian National Conference on Sensors", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2018-03-24", "journal": {"name": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "volume": "18"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2095621260", "name": "M.
