Wireless sensor networks (WSN) play an integral part in the IoT, which helps to produce seamless data that highly influence the network\u2019s lifetime. Despite the significant applications of the IoT, several challenging issues such as security, energy, load balancing, and storage exist. Energy efficiency is considered to be a vital part of the design of IoT-assisted WSN; this is accomplished by clustering and multi-hop routing techniques. In view of this, we introduce an improved metaheuristic-driven energy-aware cluster-based routing (IMD-EACBR) scheme for IoT-assisted WSN. The proposed IMD-EACBR model intends to achieve maximum energy utilization and lifetime in the network. In order to attain this, the IMD-EACBR model primarily designs an improved Archimedes optimization algorithm-based clustering (IAOAC) technique for cluster head (CH) election and cluster organization. In addition, the IAOAC algorithm computes a suitability purpose that connects multiple structures specifically for energy efficiency, detachment, node degree, and inter-cluster distance. Moreover, teaching\u2013learning-based optimization (TLBO) algorithm-based multi-hop routing (TLBO-MHR) technique is applied for optimum selection of routes to destinations. Furthermore, the TLBO-MHR method originates a suitability purpose using energy and distance metrics. The performance of the IMD-EACBR model has been examined in several aspects. Simulation outcomes demonstrated enhancements of the IMD-EACBR model over recent state-of-the-art approaches. IMD-EACBR is a model that has been proposed for the transmission of emergency data, and the TLBO-MHR technique is one that is based on the requirements for hop count and distance. In the end, the proposed network is subjected to rigorous testing using NS-3.26\u2019s full simulation capabilities. The results of the simulation reveal improvements in performance in terms of the proportion of dead nodes, the lifetime of the network, the amount of energy consumed, the packet delivery ratio (PDR), and the latency.", "venue": "Sustainability", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-06-24", "journal": {"name": "Sustainability"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "51017707", "name": "Kuruva Lakshmanna"}, {"authorId": "2132721043", "name": "Neelakandan Subramani"}, {"authorId": "2085508", "name": "Youseef A.
