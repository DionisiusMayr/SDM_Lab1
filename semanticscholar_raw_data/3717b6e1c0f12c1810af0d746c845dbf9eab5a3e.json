Web-based distributed interactive learning (DIL) environments are a type of information and communications technology that supports learners in exploring learning materials. Although educators can access learners\u2019 navigational paths on DIL websites, the exploratory nature of such paths cannot be efficiently analyzed. Educators cannot determine the effects of small improvements or adjustments on DIL websites. In this study, the navigational paths of learners using alternative versions of a DIL website were recorded and analyzed using integrated sequence analysis methods. Visualization and clustering of the sequences revealed five common navigational patterns, and associations between the navigational patterns and learning outcomes were also identified. The findings show how educators can understand and improve the design of DIL websites by performing a sequence analysis.", "venue": "Journal of Educators Online", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2018-07-31", "journal": {"name": "Journal of Educators Online"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "33541690", "name": "Jeffrey C.
