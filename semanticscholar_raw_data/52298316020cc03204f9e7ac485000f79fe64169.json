This paper proposes an analysis method and model based on Spark big data framework and takes resident income, happiness index, urban planning, and ecological environment as the indicators of Spark big data. From the high difficulty of Spark big data cluster analysis of urban public management, we build the index weight by the entropy weight method, optimize the similarity calculation, and achieve the rapid understanding of urban public management. Subsequently, the Spark big data public management platform is applied to the public management of Beijing. The results indicate that the public management platform based on Spark big data framework can improve the public management level of the city and help to build an intelligent city.", "venue": "Mathematical Problems in Engineering", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-05-17", "journal": {"name": "Mathematical Problems in Engineering"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2118358075", "name": "Zhi Liu"}], "citations": []}
