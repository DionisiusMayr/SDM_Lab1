Any optimization of the above mentioned factors would result in a website with the least loading speed which is the basic criteria considered by search engines in order to rank websites based on which the websites are displayed in the search results. Any website that satisfies the above mentioned criteria would result in the top in search results of a search engine. Any existing website is optimized by starting with the images and other media content of the landing page followed by the size optimization of the website and then the use of a content delivery network that helps the user to fetch the data from the closest server available thereby minimizing the time required to fetch the data from the central servers.And other such optimization are performed in order to increase the ranking of the website.", "venue": "", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2289030701", "name": "Mr.S.Malaiarasan"}], "citations": []}
