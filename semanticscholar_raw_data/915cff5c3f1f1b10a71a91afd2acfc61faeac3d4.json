Evaluating the performance of these stores when used for streaming workloads is cumbersome as it requires the configuration and deployment of a stream processing system that integrates the respective store, and the execution of representative queries to collect measurements. To address this issue, in this paper, we start with an empirical characterization of streaming state access workloads collected from Apache Flink and RocksDB, using three publicly available datasets, and we show that the characteristics of real traces cannot be approximated with existing benchmarks. Next, we present Gadget, a new benchmark harness that generates realistic streaming state access workloads to enable easy and thorough performance evaluation of standalone KV stores through accurate simulation of streaming operator logic. Finally, we use Gadget to investigate the suitability of RocksDB as the de facto kv store for stream processing systems. Interestingly, we find that, although RocksDB provides robust results, it is outperformed by FASTER and BerkeleyDB in six out of eleven workloads. Our results reveal a wide performance gap between the current performance of streaming state stores and what could be achieved with workload-aware approaches.", "venue": "European Conference on Computer Systems", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-03-28", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the Seventeenth European Conference on Computer Systems"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3289214", "name": "Esmail Asyabi"}, {"authorId": "2162653396", "name": "Yuanli Wang"}, {"authorId": "2551316", "name": "J.
