In this process, multiple discrete points can be used to analyze the research objects. The space system dynamics of multiple objects is a discipline that studies the motion laws of multiple objects interacting in space. In the development of Space technology, the application of space system dynamics includes spacecraft design and orbit control. This article explored a recursive calculation method for space multi body system dynamics based on data analysis, with the aim of providing new computational ideas for the aerospace field. This article mainly analyzed and designed spatial multibody systems and compared them using recursive algorithms and Lagrange methods to obtain the advantages of recursive computation. The experimental results showed that the longest CPU (Central Processing Unit) time consumed by the recursive method was 9.3 seconds, and the shortest was 1.9 seconds.", "venue": "Other Conferences", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-12-07", "journal": {"pages": "129411H - 129411H-8", "volume": "12941"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2271319531", "name": "Heyouzi Huang"}], "citations": []}
