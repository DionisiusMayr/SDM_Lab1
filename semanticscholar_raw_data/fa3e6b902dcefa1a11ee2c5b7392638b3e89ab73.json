Current model explanation system are very good at giving literal explanations of behavior in terms of pixel contributions but cannot integrate information about the physical or systems processes that might influence a prediction. This paper introduces the idea that a simple form of causal reasoning, called a regression discontinuity design, can be used to associate changes in multiple key performance indicators to physical real world phenomena to give users a more actionable set of video analytics explanations. We overview the system architecture and describe a vision of the impact that such a system might have.", "venue": "HILDA@SIGMOD", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-06-12", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the Workshop on Human-In-the-Loop Data Analytics"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2123128030", "name": "Ted Shaowang"}, {"authorId": "2181803934", "name": "Jinjin Zhao"}, {"authorId": "2740393", "name": "Stavros Sintos"}, {"authorId": "40428703", "name": "S.
