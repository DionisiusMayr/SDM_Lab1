Although dynamic route guidance has emerged as a promising solution to minimize travel times in large road networks, existing route planning frameworks often lead to congestion on certain routes, as vehicles with the same travel itinerary tend to follow the same route due to lack of central coordination. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a novel framework for centrally coordinating all vehicles on a road network. The proposed framework aims to optimize the average travel time of all vehicles while considering the fairness of all vehicles. The effectiveness of this framework has been evaluated through simulations and compared with three popular benchmark frameworks using a well-known traffic scenario and a real-world traffic scenario. The experimental results have shown that this framework outperforms the benchmark frameworks.", "venue": "IEEE Access", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "IEEE Access", "pages": "24243-24253", "volume": "12"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2288154415", "name": "Mapulage Don Rangika Lilukshi Silva"}, {"authorId": "2288161606", "name": "Maolin Tang"}], "citations": []}
