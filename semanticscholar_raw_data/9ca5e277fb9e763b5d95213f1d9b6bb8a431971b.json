Big Data lake made data consumption easier for all stakeholders, analysts, and developers. Variety, volume, and velocity of data and complexity of businesses added complexity in processing, organizing, and storing data to serve analytical solutions on a timely basis. It is often a big challenge for enterprises to cleanse, organize, classify, and store big data so that insights are accessible on time. Data consistency will also come into the picture when multiple data models define similar metrics. As numerous data sources are integrated into a single platform, stakeholders often analyze data from various subject areas. It leads to complex queries resulting in big joins and more processing power. Even with cheap storage and more processing power of Hadoop and big data technologies, modeling big data is a time-consuming and error-prone process. This paper addresses that challenge by introducing mid-tier models for big data. It discusses a novel data modeling-Mid-Tier models approach to organize and store big data in distributed storage. It outlines how it overcomes some of the challenges and showcases an example.", "venue": "", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2070426156", "name": "Jayesh Patel"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "93c4fef12fa96e0984d12988b2eccbd8562e75a5", "title": "The Democratization of Machine Learning Features"}]}
