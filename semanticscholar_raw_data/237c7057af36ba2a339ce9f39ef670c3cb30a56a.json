The wide application of the internet of things (IoT) makes the data amount rapidly increase. This leads to further raise the requirement for data processing in smart cities, especially the demand for low latency and abundant data in real-time video services. To solve this problem, a Flink based framework with smart city adaption is proposed. A mathematical model for data processing in smart cities is formulated. Through this model's solution, the path with the minimum resource occupancy ratio (ROR) is obtained. The superiority and feasibility of our work are validated via numerical simulation and prototype implementation, respectively.", "venue": "IEEE International Conference on Electronic Information and Communication Technology", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2020-11-13", "journal": {"name": "2020 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Electronic Information and Communication Technology (ICEICT)", "pages": "688-693"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "48382198", "name": "Qing-long Dai"}, {"authorId": "2113337514", "name": "Jin Qian"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "d61d50ea9d6e7827d539c014d72158b9716590bb", "title": "Time series big data: a survey on data stream frameworks, analysis and algorithms"}]}
