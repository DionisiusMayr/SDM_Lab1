For example, if a system waits \u03c4 min for an event to occur, then it automatically learns what would have happened if it waited < X min, because time has a cumulative property. This feedback is valuable because it tells us about alternative decisions, and can be used to improve the system policy. However, leveraging implicit feedback is difficult because it tends to be one-sided or incomplete, and may depend on the outcome of the event. As a result, existing practices for using feedback, such as simply incorporating it into a data-driven model, suffer from bias. We develop a methodology, called Sayer, that leverages implicit feedback to evaluate and train new system policies.", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2574478", "name": "Mathias L\u00e9cuyer"}, {"authorId": "2141972103", "name": "Sang Hoon Kim"}, {"authorId": "2649174", "name": "Mihir Nanavati"}, {"authorId": "1727978", "name": "Junchen Jiang"}, {"authorId": "30721371", "name": "S.
