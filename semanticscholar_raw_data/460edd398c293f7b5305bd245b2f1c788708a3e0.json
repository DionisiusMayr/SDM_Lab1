E-learning sites help users such as students, business workers, instructors, and those searching for different educational institutions. Excluding the benefits of this system, there are various challenges that the users face in online platforms. One of the important challenges is the true information and right content based on these resources, search results and quality. This research proposes virtual and intelligent agent-based recommendation, which requires users\u2019 profile information and preferences to recommend the proper content and search results based on their search history. We applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and semantic analysis approaches for the recommendation of course selection to e-learners and tutors. Moreover, machine learning performance analysis applied to improve the user rating results in the e-learning environment. The system automatically learns and analyzes the learner characteristics and processes the learning style through the clustering strategy. Compared with the recent state-of-the-art in this field, the proposed system and the simulation results show the minimizing number of metric errors compared to other works. The achievements of the presented approach are providing a comfortable platform to the user for course selection and recommendations. Similarly, we avoid recommending the same contents and courses. We analyze the user preferences and improving the recommendation system performance to provide highly related content based on the user profile situation. The prediction accuracy of the proposed system is 98% compared to hybrid filtering, self organization systems and ensemble modeling.", "venue": "Mathematics", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-04-06", "journal": {"name": "Mathematics"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "9239463", "name": "Zeinab Shahbazi"}, {"authorId": "1703870", "name": "Y.
