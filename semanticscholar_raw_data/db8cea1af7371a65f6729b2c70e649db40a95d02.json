However, uncertainties in the radar and the jammer, which will result in a mismatch between the test and training environments, are not considered. Therefore, a robust antijamming strategy design method is proposed in this paper, in which frequency-agile radar and a main lobe jammer are considered. This problem is first formulated under the framework of Wasserstein robust reinforcement learning. Then, the method of imitation learning-based jamming strategy parameterization is presented to express the given jamming strategy mathematically. To reduce the number of parameters that require optimization, a perturbation method inspired by NoisyNet is also proposed. Finally, robust antijamming strategies are designed by incorporating jamming strategy parameterization and jamming strategy perturbation into Wasserstein robust reinforcement learning. The simulation results show that the robust antijamming strategy leads to improved radar performance compared with the nonrobust antijamming strategy when uncertainties exist in the radar and the jammer.", "venue": "Remote Sensing", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-08-03", "journal": {"name": "Remote.
