With the development of information technology, multidimensional data grows rapidly and data structure becomes more and more complicated, so the performance of OLAP system has dopped severely, failing to satisfy the demand of data analysis. The paper proposes a new method to store large-scale multidimensional data and perform aggregation query with Hadoop, a parallel computing system. This paper implements a new column-store format HCFile (HDFS column file), and proposals a new storage solution based on it. This scheme can improve the efficiency of aggregation with good scalability. Meanwhile, this paper leverages the hierarchy schema to build dimension hierarchy index, and uses MapReduce to perform efficiency aggregation query. By comparing experiments with Hive, it shows that storage solution and aggregation query can effectively improve the performance of massive multidimensional data analysis.", "venue": "IEEE International Conference on Communication Software and Networks", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2017-05-01", "journal": {"name": "2017 IEEE 9th International Conference on Communication Software and Networks (ICCSN)", "pages": "1378-1382"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2065044845", "name": "Hui Xia"}, {"authorId": "2111193284", "name": "Peng Wu"}], "citations": []}
