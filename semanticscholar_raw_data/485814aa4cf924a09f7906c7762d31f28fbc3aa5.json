In particular, the analysis of data streams, i.e., high-velocity ephemeral data, is attracting growing interest and has led to the development of specialized stream processing engines. However, evaluating complex queries combining such ephemeral streams with historic data in a single system remains challenging. In this paper, we devise a novel stream processing technique that allows users to run ad hoc queries that combine streams and history tables in a relational database system. The backbone of our approach is a specialized ring-buffered relation, which allows for high ease of integration for existing database systems. We highlight the applicability of our approach by integrating it into the Umbra database system and demonstrate its performance against dedicated stream processing engines, outperforming them consistently for analytical workloads.", "venue": "VLDB Workshops", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2059410474", "name": "Christian Winter"}, {"authorId": "143993045", "name": "Thomas Neumann"}, {"authorId": "144122431", "name": "A.
