The processing and analysis of this huge volume data, so called Big Data, offer innumerable and still largely unexplored: health (epidemiology, genomics complex energy networks, intelligent cities, forecasting and management of environmental risks, etc. Big Data has, and will increasingly, a very significant impact at the societal economic and commercial levels. Many interesting Big Data problems can be modeled as problems on graphs/networks.", "venue": "International Symposium on High Performance Computing Systems and Applications", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2017-07-17", "journal": {"name": "2017 International Conference on High Performance Computing & Simulation (HPCS)", "pages": "893-894"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "31933880", "name": "Jolan Philippe"}, {"authorId": "3287824", "name": "Wadoud Bousdira"}, {"authorId": "1678498", "name": "F.
