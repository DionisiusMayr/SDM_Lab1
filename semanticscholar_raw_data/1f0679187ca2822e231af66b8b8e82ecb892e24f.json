These models, trained on more extensive datasets, show remarkable performance across diverse natural language tasks. However, leveraging these models to create effective services can be resource-intensive. Particularly, in addition to the cost of refining and preprocessing data, getting a large amount of data and training them is very challenging. In this paper, we propose an uncertainty-based active learning approach with ensemble technique to enhance the performance of a natural language classification model using limited data. We achieve higher performance with less data regardless of data characteristics and the number of classes.", "venue": "Information and Communication Technology Convergence", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-10-11", "journal": {"name": "2023 14th International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)", "pages": "160-165"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2280931966", "name": "Seong-Won Jeon"}, {"authorId": "2258294622", "name": "Dong-Ho Lee"}], "citations": []}
