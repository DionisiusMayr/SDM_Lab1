Currently, the underlying knowledge in raw data coming from numerous devices can mark a significant competitive advantage for utilities. It is the case of the Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI). Such technology gets user consumption characteristics at levels of detail that were previously not possible. In this context, the terms big data and data analytics become relevant, which are tools that allow using large volumes of information and the generation of valuable knowledge from raw data that can support data-driven decisions for operating on the grid. This paper presents the results of the big data implementation and data analytics techniques in a case study with smart metering data from the city of London. Implemented big data and data analytic techniques to show how to understand user consumption patterns on a broader horizon, the relationships with seasonal variables identify behaviors related to specific events and atypical consumptions. This knowledge helps support decision making about improving demand response programs and, in general, the planning and operation of the Smart Grid.", "venue": "Italian National Conference on Sensors", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-06-01", "journal": {"name": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "volume": "20"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1747004657", "name": "J.
