However, for data analysts who need to analyze vast volumes of data, large-scale data-intensive processing is becoming a necessity. Hence, they want to convert their programs, originally written to run on a single computer, to work on current Big Data systems, such as Map-Reduce and Spark, so that they can process larger amounts of data. We present a novel framework, called SQLgen, that automatically translates imperative programs with loops and array operations to distributed data-parallel programs. Unlike related work, SQL- gen translates these programs to SQL, which can be translated to more efficient code since it can be optimized using a relational database optimizer. SQLgen has been implemented on Spark SQL. We compare the performance of SQLgen with DIABLO, hand-written RDD-based, and Spark SQL programs on real- world problems. SQLgen is up to 78\u00d7 faster than DIABLO and up to 25\u00d7 faster than hand-written RDD-based programs, giving performance close to that of hand-written programs in Spark SQL.", "venue": "2020 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2020-12-10", "journal": {"name": "2020 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "pages": "469-476"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "51295778", "name": "Md Hasanuzzaman Noor"}, {"authorId": "1746298", "name": "L.
