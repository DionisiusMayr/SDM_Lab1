Such data requires processing and storage. The cloud is an online storage model where data is stored on multiple virtual servers. Big data processing represents a new challenge in computing, especially in cloud computing. Data processing involves data acquisition, storage and analysis. In this respect, there are many questions including, what is the relationship between big data and cloud computing? And how is big data processed in cloud computing? The answer to these questions will be discussed in this paper, where the big data and cloud computing will be studied, in addition to getting acquainted with the relationship between them in terms of safety and challenges. We have suggested a term for big data, and a model that illustrates the relationship between big data and cloud computing.", "venue": "", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "3380509", "name": "Nabeel Zanoon"}, {"authorId": "2077113984", "name": "A.
