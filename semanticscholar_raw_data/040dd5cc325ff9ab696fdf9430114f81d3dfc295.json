In the absence of a performance model for the distributed application, black-box optimization can be used to perform automatic cloud configuration. Numerous black-box optimization algorithms have been developed; however, their comparative evaluation has so far been limited to the hyper-parameter optimization setting, which differs significantly from the cloud configuration problem. In this paper, we evaluate 8 commonly used black-box optimization algorithms to determine their applicability for the cloud configuration problem. Our evaluation, using 23 different workloads, shows that in several cases Bayesian optimization with Gradient boosted regression trees performs better than methods chosen by prior work.", "venue": "Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-07-01", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment", "pages": "2563 - 2575", "volume": "13"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2053273351", "name": "Muhammad Bilal"}, {"authorId": "143665011", "name": "M.
