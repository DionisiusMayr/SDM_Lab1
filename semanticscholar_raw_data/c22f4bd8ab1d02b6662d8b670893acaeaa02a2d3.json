It facilitates the tracking of tangible and intangible assets. Blockchain is a distributed and decentralized database. Recent studies in this area have attracted the attention of researchers. However, comprehensive bibliometric analysis studies on blockchain technologies are insufficient in the literature. In this study, a inclusive bibliometric analysis was performed on the blockchain technology by using the R programming language and the bibliometrix and biblioshiny libraries. Web of Science (WoS) database was used for data collection. Only the keyword blockchain was searched. Data are from 3927 Science Citation Index research papers published from 2016 to 2022. Predictable information was obtained by viewing key information about various tables such as annual scientific articles, top articles per citation, authors, countries, sources, and keywords. It is aimed to be a guide for new studies by determining the trends related to blockchain technology. As a result, it has been discovered that blockchain research will intensify on the axis of privacy and security of people, and the number of research studies will increase thanks to the collaborations to be made.", "venue": "2022 Innovations in Intelligent Systems and Applications Conference (ASYU)", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-09-07", "journal": {"name": "2022 Innovations in Intelligent Systems and Applications Conference (ASYU)", "pages": "1-5"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2189466450", "name": "B\u00fclent G\u00fcnek"}, {"authorId": "93850586", "name": "Ahmet Ha\u015fim Yurttakal"}], "citations": []}
