Yet, fundamental data issues such as challenges in data quality have continued to plague disaster recovery efforts leading to delays and high costs in disaster support. This chapter presents an example of these issues from the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season, where Hurricane Katrina wreaked havoc upon the city of New Orleans forcing the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to begin an unprecedented cleanup effort. The chapter brings to light the failings in record keeping during this disaster and highlight how a simple BI application can improve the accuracy and quality of data and save costs. It also highlights the ongoing data driven issues in disaster recovery management that FEMA continues to confront and the need for integrated centralized BI and analytics solutions extending to the supply chain that FEMA needs to become more nimble and effective when dealing with disasters.", "venue": "Advances in Business Information Systems and Analytics", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "Advances in Business Information Systems and Analytics"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2118515724", "name": "Gregory Smith"}, {"authorId": "46224262", "name": "Thilini Ariyachandra"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "f21c7465a7bbbb255a68a92b514255315cb705fa", "title": "Strategy of the Regional Disaster Management Agency in Tackling Disasters in Sukabumi City"}]}
