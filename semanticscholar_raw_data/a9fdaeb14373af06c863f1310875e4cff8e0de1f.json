To make sense out of these data, scientists need to begin the knowledge discovery process with exploratory spatial data analysis, in which they issue spatial queries against their data in order to discover patterns of interest. However, in such dynamic environments, there might be no a priori knowledge about the nature of the query workloads, and there might not be enough time to build a spatial index that can reduce the query execution times. To deal with these two problems, we propose two novel spatial database cracking techniques for quadtrees, FastDynQuadtree and DynQuadtree, which are the first incremental and query-driven algorithms for cracking quadtrees. When comparing these algorithms versus existing non-cracking spatial indexes on real-world data, our experiments showed that these algorithms can reduce the query response time of the first query in a sequence by 67% and reduce the total cumulative query execution time of the first 200 queries by 17%.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "12105092", "name": "Eleazar Leal"}, {"authorId": "144099017", "name": "L.
