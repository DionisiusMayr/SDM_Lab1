The architecture of the future heterogeneous network is proposed, taking into account the evolution of emerging standards and key technologies. An algorithm for dynamic bandwidth allocation and reservation between several logical channels at a certain moment of time to provide QoS for information flows in future networks is created. A simulation model of network traffic service with parameters corresponding to real networks has been made. The study of femtocell SDR load, as the main convergent device at the level of heterogeneous network access by users of different generation mobile communication technologies has been conducted.", "venue": "Information and communication technologies electronic engineering", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-12-01", "journal": {"name": "Information and communication technologies, electronic engineering"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "9120177", "name": "H.
