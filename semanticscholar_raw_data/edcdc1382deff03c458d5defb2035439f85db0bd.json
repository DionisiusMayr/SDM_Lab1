Informative rules have recently been studied in several contexts, including data summarization, data cube exploration and data quality. The objective is to produce a small set of rules (patterns) over the values of the dimension attributes that provide the most information about the distribution of a numeric measure attribute. Within SIRUM, we propose several optimizations for tall, wide and distributed datasets. We implemented SIRUM in Spark and observed significant performance and scalability improvements on real datasets due to our optimizations. As a result, SIRUM is able to generate informative rules on much wider and taller datasets than using distributed implementations of the previous state of the art.", "venue": "IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2017-04-01", "journal": {"name": "2017 IEEE 33rd International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE)", "pages": "437-448"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3270313", "name": "Guoyao Feng"}, {"authorId": "2285679174", "name": "Lukasz Golab"}, {"authorId": "145860176", "name": "D.
