Currently, the majority of these decentralized applications are developed using smart contract platforms like Polkadot, Cardano, and Ethereum. In addition to analyzing current technology developments and prospective future applications, this article provides a historical review of smart contract platforms. The study emphasizes the significance of smart contract platforms for supporting blockchain-based applications and enabling decentralized finance (DeFi). It also looks at the emergence of layer-2 scaling solutions, the introduction of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and the growing need of interoperability among different smart contract platforms. The article also looks at the potential for multi-chain smart contracts, the effects of quantum computing, the integration of AI and ML technologies with smart contract platforms, and the potential for smart contract platforms to support decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). The difficulties of expanding smart contract platforms, the requirement for uniformity in the creation of smart contracts, and the potential for smart contract platforms to revolutionize sectors like healthcare, real estate, and supply chain management are also covered. The paper emphasizes the significance of ongoing innovation and development in smart contract platforms for the expansion of the blockchain ecosystem as it draws to a close.", "venue": "Mugla Journal of Science and Technology", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-08-14", "journal": {"name": "Mugla Journal of Science and Technology"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "52191997", "name": "Tunahan Timucin"}, {"authorId": "2646001", "name": "Serdar Birogul"}], "citations": []}
