We designed and implemented a visualization interface that leverages coordinated multi-views to support exploratory and predictive analysis of hospitalizations and other socio-geographic variables at multiple dimensions, simultaneously. By harnessing the strength of geometric deep learning, we build a consensus machine learning model to include knowledge from county-level records and investigate the complex interrelationships between global infectious disease, environment, and social justice. Additionally, we make use of unique NASA satellite-based observations which are not broadly used in the context of climate justice applications. Our current interactive interface focus on three US states (California, Pennsylvania, and Texas) to demonstrate its scientific value and presented three case studies to make qualitative evaluations.", "venue": "2022 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-11-18", "journal": {"name": "2022 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "pages": "784-791"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2202961266", "name": "A.
