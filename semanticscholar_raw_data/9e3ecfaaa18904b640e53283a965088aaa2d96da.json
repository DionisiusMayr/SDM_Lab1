While even the smallest distributed programs (with 3-5 actions) produce many unanticipated error cases due to concurrency involved, it seems short of a miracle these web-services are able to operate at those vast scales. In this paper, we explore the factors that contribute most to the high-availability of cloud computing services and examine where self-stabilization could fit in that picture.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2018-06-08", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/1806.03210"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "144501727", "name": "M.
