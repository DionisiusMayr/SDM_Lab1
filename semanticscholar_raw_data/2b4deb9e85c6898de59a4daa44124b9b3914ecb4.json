Previous approaches to explaining results have directly or indirectly relied on data provenance, i.e., input tuples contributing to the result(s) of interest. However, some information that is relevant for explaining an answer may not be contained in the provenance. We propose a new approach for explaining query results by augmenting provenance with information from other related tables in the database. Using a suite of optimization techniques, we demonstrate experimentally using real datasets and through a user study that our approach produces meaningful results and is efficient.", "venue": "SIGMOD Conference", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2021-03-29", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 2021 International Conference on Management of Data"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2109338011", "name": "Chenjie Li"}, {"authorId": "2594274", "name": "Zhengjie Miao"}, {"authorId": "36012757", "name": "Qitian Zeng"}, {"authorId": "1798930", "name": "Boris Glavic"}, {"authorId": "31938009", "name": "Sudeepa Roy"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "d53a0f75aa12181e49e1ddc687356655f16ed387", "title": "Summarized Causal Explanations For Aggregate Views"}, {"paperId": "8b88b37ba32ecde69901a9bdd6e63ffa21a5d339", "title": "NEXUS: On Explaining Confounding Bias"}, {"paperId": "ccc7c9b771370d8c0d4de7993a88102811ff34ca", "title": "Why Not Yet: Fixing a Top-k Ranking that Is Not Fair to Individuals"}, {"paperId": "a413cc6d3a291c854fbafdbe200b85ec495e4e52", "title": "TSExplain: Explaining Aggregated Time Series by Surfacing Evolving Contributors"}, {"paperId": "34eaec9643c1025065589f5513249431168a2ace", "title": "On Explaining Confounding Bias"}, {"paperId": "0f36ecdd1ad4118af8c48bcf4dd09e9808c493a2", "title": "DPXPlain: Privately Explaining Aggregate Query Answers"}, {"paperId": "99688e1e3789750d07e8de3489cdf6afdbadcbb0", "title": "The resilience of conjunctive queries with inequalities"}, {"paperId": "164716602ccb0f4e8af9ec07e02d817b6890ac64", "title": "FEDEX: An Explainability Framework for Data Exploration Steps"}, {"paperId": "009f9a2fdc25cc6146ff164ecf82431606380873", "title": "CaJaDE: Explaining Query Results by Augmenting Provenance with Context"}, {"paperId": "30d74ceaab5d5e0451c7ff9057792cb6464b8b57", "title": "Toward Interpretable and Actionable Data Analysis with Explanations and Causality"}, {"paperId": "0976bd8451b2d0281269b57f20d71734410bdc1d", "title": "XInsight: eXplainable Data Analysis Through The Lens of Causality"}, {"paperId": "a3b2a381f5ffb0959ce5460ec2d8ae34faac652e", "title": "Reproducibility Report for ACM SIGMOD 2021 Paper: \u201cPutting Things into Context: Rich Explanations for Query Answers using Join Graphs\u201d"}, {"paperId": "4e33504023dc360e43cedfb344799e6221c0fa3a", "title": "Trust in data engineering: reflection, framework, and evaluation methodology"}]}
