We consider the Strassen-Winograd algorithm (SW), one of the most efficient matrix multiplication algorithms. Our first contribution is to redesign SW with the MapReduce programming model that allows to process big data sets in parallel on a cluster. Moreover, our main contribution is to address the inherent security and privacy concerns that occur when outsourcing data to a public cloud. We propose a secure approach of SW with MapReduce called S2M3, for Secure Strassen-Winograd Matrix Multiplication with MapReduce. We prove the security of our protocol in a standard security model and provide a proof-of-concept empirical evaluation suggesting its efficiency.", "venue": "International Conference on E-Business and Telecommunication Networks", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2019-07-26", "journal": {"pages": "220-227"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1850588", "name": "Radu Ciucanu"}, {"authorId": "153528762", "name": "Matthieu Giraud"}, {"authorId": "3438430", "name": "P.
