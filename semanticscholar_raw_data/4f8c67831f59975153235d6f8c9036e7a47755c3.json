The study aims to analyze the landslide susceptibility (LS) in the Kysuca river basin, Slovakia. For this reason, previous landslide events were analyzed with 16 landslide conditioning factors. Landslide inventory was divided into training (70% of landslide locations) and validating dataset (30% of landslide locations). The heuristic approach of Fuzzy Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (FDEMATEL)-Analytic Network Process (ANP) was applied first, followed by bivariate Frequency Ratio (FR), multivariate Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest Classifier (RFC), Na\u00efve Bayes Classifier (NBC) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), respectively. The results showed that 52.2%, 36.5%, 40.7%, 50.6%, 43.6% and 40.3% of the total basin area had very high to high LS corresponding to FDEMATEL-ANP, FR, LR, RFC, NBC and XGBoost model, respectively. The analysis revealed that RFC was the most accurate model (overall accuracy of 98.3% and AUC of 97.0%). Besides, the heuristic approach of FDEMATEL-ANP model (overall accuracy of 93.8% and AUC of 92.4%) had better prediction capability than bivariate FR (overall accuracy of 86.9% and AUC of 86.1%), multivariate LR (overall accuracy of 90.5% and AUC of 91.2%), machine learning NBC (overall accuracy of 76.3% and AUC of 90.9%) and even deep learning XGBoost (overall accuracy of 92.3% and AUC of 87.1%) models. The study revealed that the FDEMATEL-ANP outweighed the NBC and XGBoost machine learning models, which suggests that heuristic methods should be tested out before directly applying machine learning models.", "venue": "Geomatics, Natural Hazards & Risk", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2021-01-01", "journal": {"name": "Geomatics, Natural Hazards and Risk", "pages": "1741 - 1777", "volume": "12"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "46546356", "name": "Q.
