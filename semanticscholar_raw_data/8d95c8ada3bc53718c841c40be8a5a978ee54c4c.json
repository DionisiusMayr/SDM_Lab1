The cost-efficient model should not only consider the content delivery cost but also the storage cost associated with the cloud network. In this article, a novel cloud-based content delivery model is proposed that uses shared storage models for cost optimization in content delivery. Shared storages are placed in different areas of the content delivery network and an efficient replica placement strategy is employed using optimization techniques. Different content delivery schemes are used in proposed model for different situations and overall content delivery cost is optimized. Experimental results show better performance and lesser cost in terms of storage, traffic and latency and also satisfy Quality-of-Service (QoS) and Quality-of-Experience (QoE) in content delivery using PSO when compared to ACO and GA.", "venue": "International Journal of Cloud Applications and Computing", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2018-07-01", "journal": {"name": "Int.
