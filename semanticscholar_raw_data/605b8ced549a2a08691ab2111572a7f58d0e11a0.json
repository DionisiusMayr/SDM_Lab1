Since Disasters are difficult to cope with and stop, researchers have focused on the pre-disaster management phase to reduce damage. Pre-disaster management is the first phase in a disaster management cycle, it uses available data collected from different resources, to detect and predict disaster cases in order to give rescue teams more time to prepare and make decisions.With development of modern technologies and equipment many systems and approaches were proposed based on this development to improve the effectiveness and performance of disaster management and early warning systems. This paper aims to provide an overview of last years studies, focusing on new technologies (IoT, Machine learning, Big Data) for pre-disaster management.", "venue": "2022 2nd International Conference on New Technologies of Information and Communication (NTIC)", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-12-21", "journal": {"name": "2022 2nd International Conference on New Technologies of Information and Communication (NTIC)", "pages": "1-7"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1646864340", "name": "Yehya Bouzeraa"}, {"authorId": "2215014248", "name": "Nardjas Bouchemal"}, {"authorId": "2279218240", "name": "Nada Zendaoui"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "9fd400ebb30b70a7284a11937f797f8a7bc65157", "title": "Leveraging the Internet of Things (IoT) for Disaster Management: Enhancing Resilience, Early Warning System in a Globally Connected World"}]}
