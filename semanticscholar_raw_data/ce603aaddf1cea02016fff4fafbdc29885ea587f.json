In addition to these problems, resource depletion and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, agriculture also contributes to global warming. To reduce the dangers of climate change, farmers are using sustainable practices. This article aims to link agri\u2010food 4.0 technology with climate\u2010smart agriculture (CSA) to lessen the two\u2010way interaction (both affecting and impacted) between the agricultural sector and global warming, as well as dangers related to the agri\u2010food business. In light of this information, the research methodology of the paper is twofold. Initially, related risks towards climate change and the CSA and agri\u2010food 4.0 technologies to overcome these risks were determined through a literature review. Then, risks and technologies are evaluated by adopting the TODIM (an acronym in Portuguese for Interactive and Multicriteria Decision Making), which is used for evaluating the criteria set with the related technologies to overcome climate change\u2010related risks and provide a guiding map for academics and practitioners to eliminate risks associated with these climate change\u2010related factors. According to the study's findings, the highest\u2010priority concerns in the agri\u2010food industries that are connected to climate change include energy consumption, food safety and GHG emissions. Internet of Things (IoT), bio\u2010innovation and artificial intelligence are thought to be the most promising technological solutions to address these problems.", "venue": "Business Strategy and the Environment", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-11-27", "journal": {"name": "Business Strategy and the Environment"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2472142", "name": "Yi\u011fit Kazan\u00e7o\u011flu"}, {"authorId": "1500725853", "name": "\u00c7isem Laf\u00e7\u0131"}, {"authorId": "2261254527", "name": "Anil Kumar"}, {"authorId": "2238324835", "name": "Sunil Luthra"}, {"authorId": "1401931357", "name": "J.
