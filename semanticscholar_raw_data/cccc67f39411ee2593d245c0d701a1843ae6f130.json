However, for important classes of queries, e.g., HAVING and top-k queries, it is impossible to determine up-front what data is relevant. To overcome this limitation, we develop provenance-based data skipping (PBDS), a novel approach that generates provenance sketches to concisely encode what data is relevant for a query. Once a provenance sketch has been captured it is used to speed up subsequent queries. PBDS can exploit physical design artifacts such as indexes and zone maps. Our approach significantly improves performance for both disk-based and main-memory database systems.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-04-26", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2104.12815"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2057834456", "name": "Xing Niu"}, {"authorId": null, "name": "Ziyu Liu"}, {"authorId": "2144881077", "name": "Pengyuan Li"}, {"authorId": "1798930", "name": "Boris Glavic"}], "citations": []}
