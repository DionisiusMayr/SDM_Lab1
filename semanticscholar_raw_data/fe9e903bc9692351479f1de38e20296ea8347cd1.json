In this paper, we propose a fuel consumption prediction model based on recurrent neural network called FuelPred . Our model easily captures the sequential nature of fuel consumption due to the effectiveness of a recurrent neural network. FuelPred integrates various features of modeling prediction. Our extensive experiment shows that (i) FuelPred outperforms several baselines; and (ii) these features are necessary to well predict the fuel consumption.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "32214450", "name": "Thanh-Nam Doan"}, {"authorId": "2288618864", "name": "Le Tuan"}, {"authorId": "2288789753", "name": "Mina Phan"}, {"authorId": "2288786890", "name": "Sartipi"}, {"authorId": "2288789761", "name": "Bus Fuel"}, {"authorId": "2288786892", "name": "Consumption"}], "citations": []}
