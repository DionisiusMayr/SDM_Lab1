The congestion and road traffic are one of the most problems facing the ambulance transportation to provide fast healthcare services for patients. In this work, a tracking and data transfer system has been introduced such that a central monitoring and tracking unit can observe ambulance using MQTT protocol where each vehicle is occupied with the embedded system unit. When an ambulance being on the road it will communicate with other cars by means of socket communication whenever the ambulance enters a new region of the city. Chat between drivers has been designed using speech recognition library-based Google API. The proposed system has been designed and implemented using a python source network programming.", "venue": "Advances in Science, Technology and Engineering Systems", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "Advances in Science, Technology and Engineering Systems Journal"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "145159842", "name": "Noor Hussein"}, {"authorId": "73757882", "name": "M.
