This research proposes a method combining a self-organizing-map (SOM) and a one-class SVM (SOM-OCSVM) to generate more reasonable non-landslide samples. We designed two steps: first, a random selection, a SOM network, a one class SVM model, and a SOM-OCSVM model were used to generate non-landslide sample datasets. Second, four machine learning models (MLs)\u2014namely logistic regression (LRG), multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF)\u2014were used to verify the effects of four non-landslide sample datasets on LSM. From the region along the Sichuan-Tibet Highway, we selected 11 conditioning factors and 1186 investigated landslides to perform the aforementioned experiments. The results show that the SOM-OCSVM method achieves the highest AUC (>0.94) and minimum standard deviation (<0.081) compared with other methods. Moreover, RF achieves the best performance in different datasets compared with other ML models. The aforementioned results prove that the proposed method can enhance the performance of ML models to produce more reliable LSM.", "venue": "Frontiers in Earth Science", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2023-01-16", "journal": {"volume": "10"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "9197228", "name": "C.
