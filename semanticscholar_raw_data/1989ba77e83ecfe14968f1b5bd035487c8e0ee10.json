Although efficient and accurate, the latest video analytic systems have not supported analytics beyond simple queries like selection. In data analytics, Top-K is a very important analytical operation that enables analysts to focus on the most important entities. In this paper, we present Everest, the first system that supports efficient and accurate Top-K video analytics. Everest ranks and identifies the most interesting frames/moments from videos with probabilistic guarantees. Everest is built with a careful synthesis of deep computer vision, machine learning, uncertain data management, and Top-K query processing. Evaluations on five real-world videos and the latest Visual Road benchmark show that Everest achieves between 16.3x to 20.6x higher efficiency than baseline approaches with high result accuracy.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-03-02", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2003.00773"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "51252562", "name": "Ziliang Lai"}, {"authorId": "2118642200", "name": "Chenxia Han"}, {"authorId": "2768964", "name": "Chris Liu"}, {"authorId": "2110149896", "name": "Pengfei Zhang"}, {"authorId": "145373095", "name": "Eric Lo"}, {"authorId": "145868757", "name": "B.
