Lenders use credit scoring to estimate the degree of risk in lending money to an individual. However, credit score evaluation is primarily based on a transaction record, payment history, professional background, etc. sourced from different credit bureaus. So, evaluating a credit score is a laborious and tedious task involving a lot of paperwork. In this paper, we propose how blockchain can provide the solution to decentralized credit scoring evaluation and reducing the amount of dependence of paperwork. Lending money is not always objective but subjective to every lender. The decision of lending involves different levels of risk and uncertainty, depending on their perspective. This paper uses the prospect theory to model the optimal investment strategy for different risk vs. return scenarios.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Economics", "Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-10-01", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering", "pages": "2566-2575", "volume": "7"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "150331642", "name": "Vikas Hassija"}, {"authorId": "150108702", "name": "Gaurang Bansal"}, {"authorId": "3185174", "name": "V.
