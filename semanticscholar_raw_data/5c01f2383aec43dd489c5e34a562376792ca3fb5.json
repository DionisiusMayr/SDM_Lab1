Blended learning is a model that adopts digital technology in the learning process, and if supported by technology-based teaching materials, it will be very efficient and effective. This study aims to investigate the needs of blended learning in high school chemistry to enhance students\u2019 metacognitive skills and attitudes towards chemistry. Particularly, the purposes of this study are described as follows: (1) to investigate students\u2019 attitudes towards chemistry on High School; (2) to analyse students\u2019 digital knowledge and experience; (3) to analyse the needs of students and teachers on High School Chemistry for the blended learning module with Thermochemistry-based Learning Management System (LMS); (4) to analyse the quality of instruments by Rasch Model. Ninety eleventh grade students and nine teachers from three high schools in Surakarta, Indonesia participated in this study. The research instrument was prepared based on the research indicators. Data collection technique used a survey and an interview. The data were analyzed through qualitative and quantitative methods. The qualitative analysis focused on the teacher\u2019s questionnaire and interview, while quantitative analysis was the students\u2019 questionnaire using the Rasch model. The study obtained the following conclusions: (1) Indonesian high school students\u2019 attitudes towards chemistry were still relatively low (2) High school knowledge and experience of digital technology in learning was high, (3) The need for LMS-based blended learning module to improve students\u2019 attitude towards chemistry and metacognition skills was very high; (4) By variable map, the research instrument test met the Rasch model requirements so that it was feasible to use.Digital technology in the 21st century is considered as a powerful tool to support innovation in learning systems.
