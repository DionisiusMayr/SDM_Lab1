Recently, the Operator Platform Group (OPG) has been introduced towards the interconnection and federation of the TEPs. In this paper, we explain in detail the standardization efforts around OPG in the context of the edge federation and we provide a list of innovative use cases enabled by this initiative. Finally, we move our scope to the market efforts, focusing on our state-of-the-art edge orchestration tool (i.e., NearbyOne) and its roadmap towards fulfilling the OPG requirements.", "venue": "IEEE Conference on Standards for Communications and Networking", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-11-28", "journal": {"name": "2022 IEEE Conference on Standards for Communications and Networking (CSCN)", "pages": "78-81"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2095502207", "name": "M.
