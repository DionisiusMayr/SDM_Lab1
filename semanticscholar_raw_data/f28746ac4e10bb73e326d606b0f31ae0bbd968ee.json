In complex optimization problems, an AO may have slow convergence or fall in sub-optimal regions, especially in high complex ones. This paper tries to overcome these problems by using three different strategies: restart strategy, opposition-based learning and chaotic local search. The developed algorithm named as mAO was tested using 29 CEC 2017 functions and five different engineering constrained problems. The results prove the superiority and efficiency of mAO in solving many optimization issues.", "venue": "Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-09-27", "journal": {"name": "Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE", "pages": "\n          14173-14211\n        ", "volume": "19 12"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "30569932", "name": "Huangjing Yu"}, {"authorId": "9118158", "name": "H.
