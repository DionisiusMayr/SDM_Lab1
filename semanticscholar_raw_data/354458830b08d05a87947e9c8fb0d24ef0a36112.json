However, approaching such systems is still too complex due to the paradigm shift they require, i.e., moving from scalable batch processing to continuous data analysis and pattern detection. Recently, declarative Languages are playing a crucial role in fostering the adoption of Stream Processing solutions. In particular, several key players introduce SQL extensions for stream processing. These new languages are currently playing a central role in fostering the stream processing paradigm shift. In this tutorial, we give an overview of the various languages for declarative querying interfaces big streaming data. To this extent, we discuss how the different Big Stream Processing Engines (BigSPE) interpret, execute, and optimize continuous queries expressed with SQL-like languages such as KSQL , Flink-SQL , and Spark SQL . Finally, we present the open research challenges in the domain.", "venue": "International Conference on Extending Database Technology", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"pages": "643-646"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "50271459", "name": "Riccardo Tommasini"}, {"authorId": "1783693", "name": "Sherif Sakr"}, {"authorId": "2539248", "name": "Emanuele Della Valle"}, {"authorId": "2041269", "name": "Hojjat Jafarpour"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "131b6e4f803cf5fb3df947132cf8c731065881d5", "title": "Semantic Foundations of Seraph Continuous Graph Query Language"}, {"paperId": "c691ee468539f37685608ea9fa8a874c58b333b9", "title": "Extending Kafka Streams for Complex Event Recognition"}, {"paperId": "f8f66427dd7ee35eb0c5ab0802aa86457ee97b9e", "title": "Seraph: Continuous Queries on Property Graph Streams"}, {"paperId": "8af073f729d0fc1f748c8f1c44ab15b6051e93c2", "title": "Velocity on the web"}, {"paperId": "dda1f5c4d317eaa41be0e12345deb9f4e0af243b", "title": "Going for Speed: Full-Stack Performance Engineering in Modern Web-Based Applications"}, {"paperId": "6d6b1efed8f80df0727eeafde549308a0921ddb0", "title": "Seraph: Continuous Queries on Property Graph Streams"}]}
