During the process of large-scale 3D model visualization based on Web scenes with the problems of slow rendering speed and low FPS (Frames Per Second), occlusion culling, as an important method for rendering optimization, can remove most of the occluded objects and improve rendering efficiency. The traditional occlusion culling algorithm (TOCA) is calculated by traversing all objects in the scene, which involves a large amount of repeated calculation and time consumption. To advance the rendering process and enhance rendering efficiency, this paper proposes an occlusion culling with three different optimization methods based on the WebGPU Computing Pipeline. Firstly, for the problem of large amounts of repeated calculation processes in TOCA, these units are moved from the CPU to the GPU for parallel computing, thereby accelerating the calculation of the Potential Visible", "venue": "Computer systems science and engineering", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "Comput.
