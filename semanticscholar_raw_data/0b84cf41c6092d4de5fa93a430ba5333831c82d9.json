Smart cities leverage innovative technologies, including the Internet of Things (IoT) and UAVs, to enhance residents\u2019 quality of life. The study highlights UAV applications, challenges, limitations, and future perspectives of smart city development. Advanced control methods for maximizing UAV benefits are discussed. Control theory challenges and issues for the deployment of UAVs are addressed. By concentrating on challenges, potential applications, and advanced control techniques, this paper offers insights into UAVs\u2019 role in shaping the future of smart cities.", "venue": "Applied Sciences", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-08-31", "journal": {"name": "Applied Sciences"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2153878580", "name": "Nadir Abbas"}, {"authorId": "2234636372", "name": "Zeshan Abbas"}, {"authorId": "46522098", "name": "Xiaodong Liu"}, {"authorId": "2222747410", "name": "Saad Saleem Khan"}, {"authorId": "2237255648", "name": "Eric Deale Foster"}, {"authorId": "2237195724", "name": "Stephen Larkin"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "38dfbf0b2c912cffe0f25f05a34efd171bfe2d8a", "title": "A flexible mixed-optimization with H\u221e control for coupled twin rotor MIMO system based on the method of inequality (MOI)- An experimental study"}, {"paperId": "5de35a3f8f0b030565d5659d0d202be85a173ce7", "title": "Energy-Efficient Internet of Drones Path-Planning Study Using Meta-Heuristic Algorithms"}, {"paperId": "05f73df2b8b23afb16b472f8f72c52d80c02d1fe", "title": "Trajectory-Aware Offloading Decision in UAV-Aided Edge Computing: A Comprehensive Survey"}, {"paperId": "afbe74d4b07c6727db508b47ecb37bc2c175a856", "title": "Micro-Doppler-Coded Drone Identification"}, {"paperId": "2f251ad747bdc0bfa8b4325d3436dc76c114a75e", "title": "Robust Trajectory Tracking Control of an Uncertain Quadrotor via a Novel Adaptive Nonsingular Sliding Mode Control"}, {"paperId": "f7b71a5527ce0d904f82fad80f866907e5702e57", "title": "Quadrotor Experimental Dynamic Identification with Comprehensive NARX Neural Networks"}, {"paperId": "1463d93b0a352fa2aeb005ebe9826446bee78663", "title": "Cooperative Positioning Method of a Multi-UAV Based on an Adaptive Fault-Tolerant Federated Filter"}, {"paperId": "259071854684a188d3897878f446bf0cc7247ba9", "title": "UAV Detection and Tracking in Urban Environments Using Passive Sensors: A Survey"}, {"paperId": "3813c8e5ea4253e25da722c0e1cb7923768f9e08", "title": "Deep Learning-Based Link Quality Estimation for RIS-Assisted UAV-Enabled Wireless Communications System"}, {"paperId": "bac1d359a586d394eda168df12bca88c85e53578", "title": "Advances in ultrasonic welding of lightweight alloys: A review"}, {"paperId": "0b38c12cea439b55c25fffe62dba103348e7ec5b", "title": "A Comprehensive Survey on 5G-and-Beyond Networks With UAVs: Applications, Emerging Technologies, Regulatory Aspects, Research Trends and Challenges"}]}
