Secondly, the pheromone setting quality function of the ant colony algorithm and the empirical feedback factor of selection probability are improved. The new method is adopted for the colonial calculation method and boundary value processing in the imperial competition algorithm. Finally, the two algorithms are merged to obtain a cloud computing task scheduling algorithm based on the ant colony algorithm-empire competition algorithm. In the simulation experiment, the algorithm demonstrates certain advantages in terms of task execution time, execution cost, and load rate.", "venue": "International Journal of Performability Engineering", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2019-08-20", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Performability Engineering"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2110318118", "name": "Yao Yao"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "6a3365571650a4d7a2d27ccc88a33c30c95dc345", "title": "Research on Cloud Computing Adaptive Task Scheduling Based on Ant Colony Algorithm"}]}
