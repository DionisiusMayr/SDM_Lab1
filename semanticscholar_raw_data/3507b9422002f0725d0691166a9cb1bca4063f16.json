The architecture of security monitoring system is considered. It speci\ufb01es several machine learning mechanisms intended for solving classi\ufb01cation tasks. The classi\ufb01er operation results are exposed to plurality voting, weight voting and soft voting. The experimental assessment of performance and accuracy of the offered methods is made.", "venue": "Journal of Internet Services and Information Security", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "J.
