Evidence from Reddit and YouTube", "abstract": "Researchers have suggested that \u201cthe Manosphere,\u201d a conglomerate of men-centered online communities, may serve as a gateway to far right movements. In that context, this paper quantitatively studies the migratory patterns between a variety of groups within the Manosphere and the Alt-right, a loosely connected far right movement that has been particularly active in mainstream social networks. Our analysis leverages over 300 million comments spread through Reddit (in 115 subreddits) and YouTube (in 526 channels) to investigate whether the audiences of channels and subreddits associated with these communities have converged between 2006 and 2018. In addition to subreddits related to the communities of interest, we also collect data on counterparts: other groups of users which we use for comparison (e.g., for YouTube we use a set of media channels). Besides measuring the similarity in the commenting user bases of these communities, we perform a migration study, calculating to which extent users in the Manosphere gradually engage with Alt-right content. Our results suggest that there is a large overlap between the user bases of the Alt-right and of the Manosphere and that members of the Manosphere have a bigger chance to engage with far right content than carefully chosen counterparts. However, our analysis also shows that migration and user base overlap varies substantially across different platforms and within the Manosphere. Members of some communities (e.g., Men\u2019s Rights Activists) gradually engage with the Alt-right significantly more than counterparts on both Reddit and YouTube, whereas for other communities, this engagement happens mostly on Reddit (e.g., Pick Up Artists). Overall, our work paints a nuanced picture of the pipeline between the Manosphere and the Alt-right, which may inform platforms\u2019 policies and moderation decisions regarding these communities.", "venue": "Web Science Conference", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-02-25", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 13th ACM Web Science Conference 2021"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2051550600", "name": "Robin Mami'e"}, {"authorId": "35700028", "name": "Manoel Horta Ribeiro"}, {"authorId": "145781376", "name": "Robert West"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "55b541a9a93bee3423e5fdfb2c0ec4620944a2ab", "title": "The Angry Echo Chamber: A Study of Extremist and Emotional Language Changes in Incel Communities Over Time."}, {"paperId": "b30e47b6459502227c74a9b41304e5ce10aed6fe", "title": "Intellectual dark web, alt-lite and alt-right: Are they really that different? a multi-perspective analysis of the textual content produced by contrarians"}, {"paperId": "a530c5e1271f4d06a72b0dfe04b1dd53aee32f77", "title": "\u201cAre there any other male friendly subs on here?\u201d - online men\u2019s rights groups as simultaneous communities of care and hate, inclusion and exclusion"}, {"paperId": "bc76a3ddfedccfd185c289c9e49ec0a8ef2e5c24", "title": "Expresiones antifeministas en YouTube.
