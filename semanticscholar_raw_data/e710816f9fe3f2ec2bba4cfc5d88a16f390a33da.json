If resources aren't distributed efficiently, essential services will suffer. Utilizing the Credal C-Means (CCM) technique, we group virtual machines across all data centres. We keep two entities, including a load monitor and a migrator, to keep the weight of each CSP steady. Here, a load monitor calculates an approximate data centre workload, and a migrator transfers live virtual machines. In this case, the Hybrid Copy method is used to relocate running virtual machines. We are able to do both internal and external live VM migration across CSPs. We use the Cloudsim tool to demonstrate the efficacy of our strategy in a federation setting. Cloudsim's simulation findings are positive across the board, but especially in regards to communication cost.", "venue": "2022 Second International Conference on Advanced Technologies in Intelligent Control, Environment, Computing & Communication Engineering (ICATIECE)", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-12-16", "journal": {"name": "2022 Second International Conference on Advanced Technologies in Intelligent Control, Environment, Computing & Communication Engineering (ICATIECE)", "pages": "1-6"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2209454303", "name": "Sunita Ojha"}, {"authorId": "2122371841", "name": "N.
