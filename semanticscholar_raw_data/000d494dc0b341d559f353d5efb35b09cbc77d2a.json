Fault injection attacks (FIAs) stand out as one of the most widespread. Particularly, voltage-based FIAs (V-FIAs) have gained popularity due to their non-invasive nature and high effectiveness in inducing faults by pushing the IoT hardware to its operational limits. Improving the security of devices and gaining a comprehensive understanding of their vulnerabilities is of utmost importance. In this study, we present a novel fault injection method and employ it to target an 8-bit AVR microcontroller. We identify the optimal attack parameters by analyzing the detected failures and their trends. A case study is conducted to validate the efficacy of this new method in a more realistic scenario, focusing on a simple authentication method using the determined optimal parameters. This analysis not only demonstrates the feasibility of the V-FIA but also elucidates the primary characteristics of the resulting failures and their propagation in resource-constrained devices. Additionally, we devise a hardware/software countermeasure that can be integrated into any resource-constrained device to thwart such attacks in IoT scenarios.", "venue": "Italian National Conference on Sensors", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-08-01", "journal": {"name": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "volume": "23"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2231875226", "name": "Nicol\u00e1s Ruminot"}, {"authorId": "145949609", "name": "C.
