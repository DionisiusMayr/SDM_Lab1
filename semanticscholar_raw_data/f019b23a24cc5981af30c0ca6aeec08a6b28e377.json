Satisfying user\u2019s demands (e.g., end-to-end delay) on one hand and minimizing the cost of SFC deployment in terms of energy and resource on the other hand, introduces VNFs placement as a crucial issue that is receiving significant attention by researchers. To address this problem and boost the performance of SFC, different techniques such as Network Function (NF) distribution, NF parallelism and optimal resource allocation have been utilized. Applying these mechanisms imposes other costs which must be taken into account by network providers. In this paper, we introduce CoDeC as a Cost-effective and Delay-aware resource allocation approach. By having user defined end-to-end threshold and using aforementioned mechanisms, CoDeC tries to place the requested VNFs with the minimum cost of deployment, distribution, parallelism and energy. Therefore, we formulate the addressed problem in form of Mixed Integer linear Programming (MILP) model. We then show that the problem is NP-complete and suffers from high time complexity in large-scale scenarios. Thus, a heuristic algorithm is introduced to determine a near-optimal solution in a reasonable amount of time. Our simulation results show that CoDeC achieves better performance in term of cost and acceptance rate compared to using each mechanism individually.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-06-01", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management", "pages": "793-806", "volume": "17"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2332034", "name": "F.
