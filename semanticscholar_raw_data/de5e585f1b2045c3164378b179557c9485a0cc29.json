Those approaches have been based so far on either (i) sampling or (ii) branch-and-bound with model-based bounds. We present here a more general branch-and-bound framework that extends the possible bounds by using 'dissociation', which yields tighter bounds.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2018-06-26", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/1806.10078"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "51000734", "name": "M.
