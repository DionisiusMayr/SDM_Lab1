This work aims to contribute towards improving the decision-making capabilities of relief organisations by offering more comprehensive understanding of the critical success factors (CSFs) concerning HSC. Hence, the current work attempts to classify CSFs as cause-and-effect factors and explore their relative importance in the stated significance.Design/methodology/approachCurrent work takes an explorative and deductive approach. It uses literature and experts' input to identify the CSFs for HSC and to develop a structural model for assessing these factors. Intuitionistic fuzzy DEMATEL (IF-D) is employed for modelling and analysing the cause-effect linkages among the CSFs. IF-D method is chosen as it is robust to vagueness of data and small samples.FindingsThe findings indicate that \u201cmotivated and committed employees\u201d is the most influencing causal factor followed by \u201cIT infrastructure\u201d, and among effect factors, \u201cphysical network\u201d carries the most significance followed by \u201canticipation capabilities.\u201dPractical implicationsRelief organisations and stakeholders at various levels may put more emphasis on cause group factors with more influence on most critical effect factors to build more efficient and effective HSC to execute more impactful relief programs.Originality/valueCurrent work explores the cause\u2013effect relationships among the CSFs concerning HSC by implementing IF-D, which can be considered as the original contribution.", "venue": "Benchmarking : An International Journal", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-09-25", "journal": {"name": "Benchmarking: An International Journal"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "48146105", "name": "Sangita Choudhary"}, {"authorId": "73630027", "name": "T.
