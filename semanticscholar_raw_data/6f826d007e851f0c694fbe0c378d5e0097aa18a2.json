Recently, using Large Language Models (LLMs) has become the mainstream method for table reasoning, because it not only significantly reduces the annotation cost but also exceeds the performance of previous methods. However, existing research still lacks a summary of LLM-based table reasoning works. Due to the existing lack of research, questions about which techniques can improve table reasoning performance in the era of LLMs, why LLMs excel at table reasoning, and how to enhance table reasoning abilities in the future, remain largely unexplored. This gap significantly limits progress in research. To answer the above questions and advance table reasoning research with LLMs, we present this survey to analyze existing research, inspiring future work. In this paper, we analyze the mainstream techniques used to improve table reasoning performance in the LLM era, and the advantages of LLMs compared to pre-LLMs for solving table reasoning. We provide research directions from both the improvement of existing methods and the expansion of practical applications to inspire future research.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2024-02-13", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2402.08259"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2284033114", "name": "Xuanliang Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2159084043", "name": "Dingzirui Wang"}, {"authorId": "49093992", "name": "Longxu Dou"}, {"authorId": "2283927956", "name": "Qingfu Zhu"}, {"authorId": "2283920108", "name": "Wanxiang Che"}], "citations": []}
