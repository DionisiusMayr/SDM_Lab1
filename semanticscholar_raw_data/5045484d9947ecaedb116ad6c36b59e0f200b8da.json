In this paper, we design a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) framework to accelerate graph algorithms based on the edge-centric paradigm. Our design is flexible for accelerating general graph algorithms with various vertex attributes and update propagation functions, such as Sparse Matrix Vector Multiplication (SpMV), PageRank (PR), Single Source Shortest Path (SSSP), and Weakly Connected Component (WCC). The target platform consists of large external memory to store the graph data and FPGA to accelerate the processing. By taking an edge-centric graph algorithm and hardware resource constraints as inputs, our framework can determine the optimal design parameters and produce an optimized Register-Transfer Level (RTL) FPGA accelerator design. To improve data locality and increase parallelism, we partition the input graph into non-overlapping partitions. This enables our framework to efficiently buffer vertex data in the on-chip memory of FPGA and exploit both inter-partition and intra-partition parallelism. Further, we propose an optimized data layout to improve external memory performance and reduce data communication between FPGA and external memory. Based on our design methodology, we accelerate two fundamental graph algorithms for performance evaluation: Sparse Matrix Vector Multiplication (SpMV) and PageRank (PR). Experimental results show that our accelerators sustain a high throughput of up to 2250 Million Traversed Edges Per Second (MTEPS) and 2487 MTEPS for SpMV and PR, respectively. Compared with several highly-optimized multi-core designs, our FPGA framework achieves up to 20.5\u00d7 speedup for SpMV, and 17.7\u00d7 speedup for PR, respectively; compared with two state-of-the-art FPGA frameworks, our designs demonstrate up to 5.3\u00d7 and 1.8\u00d7 throughput improvement for SpMV and PR, respectively.", "venue": "ACM International Conference on Computing Frontiers", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2018-05-08", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 15th ACM International Conference on Computing Frontiers"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2110990110", "name": "Shijie Zhou"}, {"authorId": "2286832947", "name": "R.
