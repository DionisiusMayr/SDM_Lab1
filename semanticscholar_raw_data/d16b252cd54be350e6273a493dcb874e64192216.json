This is due to the major impact of ocean products on disaster management, shipping, fisheries, autonomy, coastal operations, and scientific studies. Yet, there are several challenges for effective communication of data through visualization techniques. Specifically, ocean data is multivariate (e.g. temperature, salinity, velocity, etc.), is available for multiple depths and multiple time instants, and contains uncertainties, all of which leads to large, multi-dimensional datasets. Thus, it is necessary to have an interactive multiscale multivariate visualization tool that can assist scientists, engineers, policy makers, and the public in making insights from big data produced by ocean predictions and observations. In this work, we present a 3D (spatial) + 1 (temporal) multi-resolution multivariate visualization tool that produces interactive, dynamic, fast and portable ocean maps.", "venue": "OCEANS 2019 MTS/IEEE SEATTLE", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2019-10-01", "journal": {"name": "OCEANS 2019 MTS/IEEE SEATTLE", "pages": "1-10"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "40283653", "name": "W.
