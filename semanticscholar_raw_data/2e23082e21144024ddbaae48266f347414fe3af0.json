Dystonia is a movement disorder classified by involuntary patterned or twisting body movements, which further results in atypical postures (2). Isolated dystonia is a rare neurological disorder where the patient has dystonia without other neurological disorders like Alzheimer\u2019s. Dystonia often harms the quality of life and can be markedly disabling (3); furthermore, a relatively high number of cases are misdiagnosed or underdiagnosed because of the non-availability of a global biomarker. In a recent research paper by Valeriani and Simonyan (4), a deep learning-based method was proposed, i.e., DystoniaNet, which can recognize a microstructural neural network biomarker for the diagnosis of dystonia from raw MRIs. The biomarker-based on DystoniaNet depicted an overall accuracy of 98.8%, including 3.5% cases in which the network referred the case for further analysis with a diagnosis time of 0.36 s per subject; this was a significant improvement over shallow machine learning networks. The assisted diagnosis of isolated dystonia using deep learning has opened a new direction where computational intelligence plays its part in the early diagnosis of movement disorders.", "venue": "Frontiers in Neurology", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-04-30", "journal": {"name": "Frontiers in Neurology", "volume": "12"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1945070", "name": "S.
