The Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) standard, which provides a graphical representation of a workflow, allows stakeholders to discuss the scientific conceptual approach behind this modelling while also defining a machine\u2010readable encoding in XML. Previous research has enabled the orchestration of Open Geospatial Consortium Web Processing Services (WPS) with a BPMN workflow engine. However, the need for direct access to predefined data inputs and outputs results in a lack of flexibility during composition of the workflow and of efficiency during execution. This article develops metadata profiling approaches, described as two possible configurations, which enable workflow management at the meta\u2010level through a coupling with a metadata catalogue. Specifically, a WPS profile and a BPMN profile are developed and tested using open\u2010source components to achieve this coupling. A case study in the context of an event mapping task applied within a big data framework and based on analysis of the Global Database of Event Language and Tone database illustrates the two different architectures.", "venue": "Trans.
