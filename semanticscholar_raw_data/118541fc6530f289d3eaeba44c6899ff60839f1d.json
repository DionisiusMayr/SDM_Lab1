As more edge computing applications are being deployed, there is a growing need to ensure fault tolerance for such systems. To achieve fault-tolerant edge computing, understanding potential faults and fault-injection methods is crucial. In this paper, we surveyed 76 research publications in over 25 top conferences and journals published during the last 6 years with a focus on fault-tolerant edge computing. Through our analysis, we identified the most relevant faults as well as the common practical fault-injection techniques, simulation frameworks, and benchmarks used in edge computing. Our key insights from this survey underscore the importance of handling edge-centric faults including performance, resource-stressing, and network-partition faults as well as developing edge-centric fault-injection methods and dependability benchmarks in future studies.", "venue": "International Conference on Edge Computing [Services Society]", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-07-01", "journal": {"name": "2023 IEEE International Conference on Edge Computing and Communications (EDGE)", "pages": "63-71"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "51362804", "name": "M.
