The key novelty is the extendable embedding abstraction which can express pattern enumeration algorithms, allow fine-grained task scheduling, and enable low-cost GPM-specific data reuse to reduce communication cost. The effective BFS-DFS hybrid exploration generates sufficient concurrent tasks for communication-computation overlapping with bounded memory consumption. Two scalable distributed GPM systems are implemented by porting Automine and GraphPi on Khuzdul. Our evaluation shows that Khuzdul based systems significantly outperform state-of-the-art distributed GPM systems with partitioned graphs by up to 75.5\u00d7 (on average 19.0\u00d7), achieve similar or even better performance compared with the fastest distributed GPM systems with replicated graph, and scale to massive graphs with more than one hundred billion edges with a commodity cluster.", "venue": "International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-01-27", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 28th ACM International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems, Volume 2"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2108536872", "name": "Jingji Chen"}, {"authorId": "2288203548", "name": "Xuehai Qian"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "ebc06a22fa91e03648bc38e3a02cf444d8d3785e", "title": "CUTTANA: Scalable Graph Partitioning for Faster Distributed Graph Databases and Analytics"}]}
