However, non-uniform voltage fluctuation and local thermal hotspot in CPU layers are coupled into DRAM layers, causing a non-uniform bit-cell leakage (thereby bit flip) distribution. We propose a performance-power-resilience simulation framework to capture DRAM soft error in 3D multi-core CPU systems. A dynamic resilience management (DRM) scheme is investigated, which adaptively tunes CPU's operating points to adjust DRAM's voltage noise and thermal condition during runtime. The DRM uses dynamic frequency scaling to achieve a resilience borrow-in strategy, which effectively enhances DRAM's resilience without sacrificing performance.", "venue": "International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design", "year": 2016, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Engineering"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2016-08-08", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 2016 International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1751577", "name": "Tiantao Lu"}, {"authorId": "1892425", "name": "Caleb Serafy"}, {"authorId": "2109466363", "name": "Zhiyuan Yang"}, {"authorId": null, "name": "Ankur Srivastava"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "acc2745464501b1e98d07962807b395282d79867", "title": "Thermal Management for 3D-Stacked Systems via Unified Core-Memory Power Regulation"}, {"paperId": "2fea39ff0f591809a2b7e018579883ab31e8289e", "title": "A survey of optimization techniques for thermal-aware 3D processors"}, {"paperId": "93c477630a70623a8c5eadb81b6543bde8ec8031", "title": "Low-Power Clock Tree Synthesis for 3D-ICs"}, {"paperId": "daa7978ad06ea94ead74276b2df3b1f1a1d95d14", "title": "TSV-Based 3-D ICs: Design Methods and Tools"}, {"paperId": "9be57b43badb6c0346fb0cd40ce9627710e09715", "title": "Thermal, Power Delivery and Reliability Management for 3D ICS"}]}
