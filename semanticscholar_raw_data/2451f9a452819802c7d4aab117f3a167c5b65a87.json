In this study, we introduce a pluggable CTG framework for Large Language Models (LLMs) named Dynamic Attribute Graphs-based controlled text generation (DATG). This framework utilizes an attribute scorer to evaluate the attributes of sentences generated by LLMs and constructs dynamic attribute graphs. DATG modulates the occurrence of key attribute words and key anti-attribute words, achieving effective attribute control without compromising the original capabilities of the model. We conduct experiments across four datasets in two tasks: toxicity mitigation and sentiment transformation, employing five LLMs as foundational models. Our findings highlight a remarkable enhancement in control accuracy, achieving a peak improvement of 19.29% over baseline methods in the most favorable task across four datasets. Additionally, we observe a significant decrease in perplexity, markedly improving text fluency.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-02-17", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2402.11218"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2268495952", "name": "Xun Liang"}, {"authorId": "2284861141", "name": "Hanyu Wang"}, {"authorId": "2268434524", "name": "Shichao Song"}, {"authorId": "2284693051", "name": "Mengting Hu"}, {"authorId": "2284731968", "name": "Xunzhi Wang"}, {"authorId": "2268429641", "name": "Zhiyu Li"}, {"authorId": "2268399953", "name": "Feiyu Xiong"}, {"authorId": "2268400606", "name": "Bo Tang"}], "citations": []}
