This distributed strategy prevents data leakage and enables on-device training as it updates the global model based on the local model updates. Despite offering several advantages, including data privacy and scalability, FL poses challenges such as statistical and system heterogeneity of data in federated networks, communication bottlenecks, privacy and security issues. This survey contains a systematic summarization of previous work, studies, and experiments on FL and presents a list of possibilities for FL across a range of applications and use cases. Other than that, various challenges of implementing FL and promising directions revolving around the corresponding challenges are provided.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-03-26", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2303.14787"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2034276221", "name": "Taki Hasan Rafi"}, {"authorId": "2151502565", "name": "Faiza Anan Noor"}, {"authorId": "2215989663", "name": "Tahmid Hussain"}, {"authorId": "3257314", "name": "Dong-Kyu Chae"}, {"authorId": "2197866447", "name": "Zhaohui Yang"}], "citations": []}
