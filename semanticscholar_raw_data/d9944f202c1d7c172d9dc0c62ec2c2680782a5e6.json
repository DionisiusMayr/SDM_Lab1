Ingesting JSON documents can be a performance bottleneck. A popular parsing strategy consists in converting the input text into a tree\u2010based data structure\u2014sometimes called a Document Object Model or DOM. We designed and implemented a novel JSON parsing interface\u2014called On\u2010Demand\u2014that appears to the programmer like a conventional DOM\u2010based approach. However, the underlying implementation is a pointer iterating through the content, only materializing the results (objects, arrays, strings, numbers) lazily. On recent commodity processors, an implementation of our approach provides superior performance in multiple benchmarks. To ensure reproducibility, our work is freely available as open source software. Several systems use On\u00a0Demand: for example, Apache Doris, the Node.js JavaScript runtime, Milvus, and Velox.", "venue": "Software: Practice and Experience", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-12-28", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2312.17149"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "147092267", "name": "John Keiser"}, {"authorId": "2276609149", "name": "Daniel Lemire"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "d04cf34b793d99b23dd695017f3f415b172b4b33", "title": "SPEAR-JSON: Selective Parsing of JSON to Enable Accelerated Stream Processing on FPGAs"}]}
