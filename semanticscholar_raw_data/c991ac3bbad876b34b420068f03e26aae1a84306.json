Optimising the electricity information pre-processing model, store and manage the various types of raw and application data collected in a classified manner, define the objective function as the algebraic sum of the squared measurement errors, construct an electricity big data tensor filling model, treat missing values as variables, and design a missing filling method based on a variational self-encoder. Experimental results: The mean value of MAPE of the big data missing fill method for electricity consumption information in the paper is: 38.514%, indicating that the performance of the designed big data missing fill method for electricity consumption information is better after fusing the variational self-encoder.", "venue": "International Conference on Electronic Information Engineering, Big Data and Computer Technology", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-05-02", "journal": {"pages": "126420V - 126420V-8", "volume": "12642"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2157497430", "name": "Yong Shi"}, {"authorId": "1500411359", "name": "Zhengxiong Mao"}, {"authorId": "2071898092", "name": "Fu Bao"}, {"authorId": "2152949630", "name": "Yuan Tian"}, {"authorId": "2119079338", "name": "Hang Zhang"}], "citations": []}
