A large dataset of tweets is explored, extracted, transformed, loaded, cleansed, and analyzed. The proposed framework improves prediction quality with a proposed dictionary that is used to classify tweets. The study compares four supervised machine learning algorithms and finds that people discuss the pandemic's dangers from economic and health perspectives with equal frequency. The Naive Bayes algorithm achieves the highest percentage of correct predictions.", "venue": "Information Sciences Letters", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-08-01", "journal": {"name": "Information Sciences Letters"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "47309069", "name": "Awny Sayed"}, {"authorId": "41229815", "name": "M.
