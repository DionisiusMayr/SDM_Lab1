One of the important criteria when choosing a NoSQL database for an application is its performance in terms of speed of data accessing and processing, including response times to the most important CRUD operations (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE). In this paper, the behavior of two of the major document-based NoSQL databases, MongoDB and document-based MySQL, was analyzed in terms of the complexity and performance of CRUD operations, especially in query operations. The main objective of the paper is to make a comparative analysis of the impact that each specific database has on application performance when realizing CRUD requests. To perform this analysis, a case-study application was developed using the two document-based MongoDB and MySQL databases, which aim to model and streamline the activity of service providers that use a lot of data. The results obtained demonstrate the performance of both databases for different volumes of data; based on these, a detailed analysis and several conclusions were presented to support a decision for choosing an appropriate solution that could be used in a big-data application.", "venue": "Big Data and Cognitive Computing", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-05-05", "journal": {"name": "Big Data Cogn.
