To address the lack of systematic understanding of how these algorithms are currently designed, we reviewed an extensive corpus of papers proposing algorithms for decision-making in higher education. We categorized them based on input data, computational method, and target outcome, and then investigated the interrelations of these factors with the application of human-centered lenses: theoretical, participatory, or speculative design. We found that the models are trending towards deep learning, and increased use of student personal data and protected attributes, with the target scope expanding towards automated decisions. However, despite the associated decrease in interpretability and explainability, current development predominantly fails to incorporate human-centered lenses. We discuss the challenges with these trends and advocate for a human-centered approach.", "venue": "International Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book", "Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-02-12", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 2023 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2205558195", "name": "Kelly McConvey"}, {"authorId": "2345714", "name": "Shion Guha"}, {"authorId": "2343939", "name": "Anastasia Kuzminykh"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "c7aba9ea3e5931dff6dbfc621f47c6334302761f", "title": "\"This is not a data problem\": Algorithms and Power in Public Higher Education in Canada"}, {"paperId": "d77cc519cd54518658cb6a9a3a99245959bd254a", "title": "Beyond Predictive Algorithms in Child Welfare"}, {"paperId": "34ff3baeb735ccf2e8df86572c421ca43e67c696", "title": "Are We Asking the Right Questions?: Designing for Community Stakeholders' Interactions with AI in Policing"}, {"paperId": "02d7a1a02ba605789414c1f6aa9a940807bcbe04", "title": "A Human-Centered Review of Algorithms in Homelessness Research"}, {"paperId": "c8cc6ca886011e63c64bc9ac03b5a7798734fcec", "title": "A meta systematic review of artificial intelligence in higher education: a call for increased ethics, collaboration, and rigour"}, {"paperId": "b89349180eaefcb39b326b59cc720018c8ab4b7b", "title": "Adaptive learning in programming education: A systematic mapping of the literature"}, {"paperId": "b292966654c71a4e56b8321294011896172def46", "title": "Algorithmic Harms in Child Welfare: Uncertainties in Practice, Organization, and Street-level Decision-Making"}, {"paperId": "48e4152b91fa8b89855570b09b0427afccfcb005", "title": "The Bot on Speaking Terms: The Effects of Conversation Architecture on Perceptions of Conversational Agents"}]}
