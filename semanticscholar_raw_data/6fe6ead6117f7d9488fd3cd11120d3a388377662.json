By integrating stakeholder theory and dynamic capability theory, this study aims to determine the impact of corporate social responsibility (CSR) on SSCM practices and assess its impact on organizational performance. This research also investigates the role of big data analytical capabilities (BDAC) in mediating the relationship between SSCM practices and organizational performance. The authors collected data online, examined 320 valid responses, and tested research hypotheses. The findings suggest that CSR (both internal and external CSR) positively promotes SSCM practices and contributes to expanding dynamic capacity theory in the context of BDA capabilities. BDAC is also a key mediator between SSCM practices and organizational performance. These results contribute to and improve the research on stakeholder theory and SSCM practice and provide a new perspective for scholars to further study this issue.", "venue": "Sustainability", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-03-14", "journal": {"name": "Sustainability"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2157403106", "name": "Changchun Zhu"}, {"authorId": "2149077228", "name": "Jianguo Du"}, {"authorId": "66567533", "name": "Fakhar Shahzad"}, {"authorId": "1722975287", "name": "Muhammad Umair Wattoo"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "83976bde6b619c3ac71069e0a0d04bdc5104f0a3", "title": "Big data driven supply chain innovative capability for sustainable competitive advantage in the food supply chain: Resource\u2010based view perspective"}, {"paperId": "4c6847fb7e0fb66f5c9e2e16b0122fd59d7afb0b", "title": "The Effect of Organizational Commitment, Organization Funding, and Intervening Organizational Performance towards Organizational Sustainability (on Islamic Boarding)"}, {"paperId": "e902afbd347a7a1f9b9028b982f147f9669a27d4", "title": "Analyzing the Nexus Between Environmental\nRegulations, Green Supply Chain Management,\nand Corporate Social Responsibility\nin the Agri-Food Business"}, {"paperId": "296fdb5aa5bdec8a7b54387e98694fd0337049f4", "title": "Seaweed: a sustainable solution for greening drug manufacturing in the pursuit of sustainable healthcare"}, {"paperId": "cad1d917731df7592f03be949909f210a0497790", "title": "Green process innovation, green product innovation, leverage, and corporate financial performance; evidence from system GMM"}, {"paperId": "f0e7a4e1fef7004880992f90aa529b57a0f5a0c3", "title": "The nexus between green intellectual capital, blockchain technology, green manufacturing, and sustainable performance."}, {"paperId": "61a7c8d8091022c002b014510bf425c90ed600bd", "title": "The relationship between information processing capabilities, Net-Zero capability and supply chain performance"}, {"paperId": "0f516f3784981781b05d1a06a1e9b5efd0872624", "title": "Drivers and influencers of blockchain and cloud-based business sustainability accounting in China: Enhancing practices and promoting adoption"}, {"paperId": "96edc6c7d1f58340099890addf42eacf8ac44f1c", "title": "Firms\u2019 shareholding behavior in green supply chains: Carbon emissions reduction, power structures, and technology spillovers"}, {"paperId": "97b45640a7c007689af0ebfc68b0286be7f58344", "title": "Big data analytics capabilities: Patchwork or progress?
