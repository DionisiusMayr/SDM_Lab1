However, despite being a key to efficiently managing application execution in the cloud, traditional workflow scheduling algorithms face significant challenges in the cloud environment. The gradient-based optimizer (GBO) is a newly proposed evolutionary algorithm with a search engine based on the Newton\u2019s method. It employs a set of vectors to search in the solution space. This study designs a gradient-based scheduler by using GBO for workflow scheduling to minimize the usage costs of workflows under given deadline constraints. Extensive experiments are conducted on well-known scientific workflows of different sizes and types using WorkflowSim. The experimental results show that the proposed scheduling algorithm outperforms five other state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both the constraint satisfiability and cost optimization, thereby verifying its advantages in addressing workflow scheduling problems.", "venue": "Journal of Advanced Computational Intelligence and Intelligent Informatics", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-01-20", "journal": {"name": "J.
