New Evidence from Chinese Corporate Pollution Data", "abstract": "Using China\u2019s smart city construction as a quasi-natural experiment, by matching the data of the Chinese Industrial Enterprises Database, Chinese Enterprises Pollution Emission Database and prefecture-level city data from 2008-2014, this paper evaluates the impact of smart city construction on enterprise pollution emissions using the difference-in-difference method (DID) and propensity score matching DID method (PSM-DID). The empirical results show that smart cities construction effectively promotes the pollution reduction of enterprises, and the estimation results based on the PSM-DID method show robust. The mechanism investigation shows that smart city construction can achieve effective suppression of enterprise pollution emissions through the output effect, technology effect and scale effect.", "venue": "", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2249694276", "name": "Juan Li"}, {"authorId": "2255313959", "name": "Zixuan Li"}, {"authorId": "2249579709", "name": "Huiping You"}], "citations": []}
