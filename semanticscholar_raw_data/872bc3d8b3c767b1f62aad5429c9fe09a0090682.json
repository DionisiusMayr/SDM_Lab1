These insights are valuable for clinical applications but also open up possibilities for identification and abuse of personal information. In this article, we survey recent research on classical methods of privacy-preserving data mining. Looking at dominant techniques and recent innovations to them, we examine the applicability of these methods to the privacy-preserving analysis of clinical data. We also discuss promising directions for future research in this area.", "venue": "Trans.
