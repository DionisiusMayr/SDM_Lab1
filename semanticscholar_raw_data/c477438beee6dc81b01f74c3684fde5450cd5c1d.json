These notoriously rely on large amounts of training data. However, the collection of conversational data is often a tedious and costly process. This is especially true for Task-Oriented Dialogs, where the system ought to help the user achieve specific tasks, such as making reservations. We investigate a controlled strategy for dialog synthesis. Our method generates utterances based on dialog annotations in a sequence-to-sequence manner. Besides exploring the viability of the approach itself, we also explore the effect of constrained beam search on the generation capabilities. Moreover, we analyze the effectiveness of the proposed method as a data augmentation by studying the impact the synthetic dialogs have on training dialog systems. We perform the experiments in multiple settings, simulating various amounts of ground-truth data. Our work shows that a controlled generation approach is a viable method to synthesize Task-Oriented Dialogs, that can in turn be used to train dialog systems. We were able to improve this process by utilizing constrained beam search.", "venue": "PANDL", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 2nd Workshop on Pattern-based Approaches to NLP in the Age of Deep Learning"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2243462009", "name": "Sebastian Steindl"}, {"authorId": "2243463325", "name": "Ulrich Sch\u00e4fer"}, {"authorId": "2243455821", "name": "Bernd Ludwig"}], "citations": []}
