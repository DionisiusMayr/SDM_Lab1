The current models indeed suffer from spurious correlations and have a tendency to generate irrelevant and generic responses. Inspired by causal discovery algorithms, we propose a novel model-agnostic method for training and inference using a conditional independence classifier. The classifier is trained by a constrained self-training method, coined ConSTrain, to overcome data sparsity. The experimental results based on both human and automatic evaluation show that our method significantly outperforms the competitive baselines in terms of relevance, informativeness, and fluency.", "venue": "Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-03-02", "journal": {"name": "Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics", "pages": "511-530", "volume": "11"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2056029883", "name": "Tao Feng"}, {"authorId": "153139892", "name": "Lizhen Qu"}, {"authorId": "2561045", "name": "Gholamreza Haffari"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "ea8b03b1ad74a5dd2d5584e4bdf4e077b004eee6", "title": "RENOVI: A Benchmark Towards Remediating Norm Violations in Socio-Cultural Conversations"}]}
