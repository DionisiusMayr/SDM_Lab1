While many methods based on CSs can improve query performance, especially for star queries, query performance will be seriously affected when the workload is complicated and produces many CSs. In this paper, we present CoPMP, merging CSs based on the correlations between predicates within the CSs and partitioning predicates. Our method captures the predicate correlation and merges CSs to reduce the number of CSs. The merging operation is driven by the cost model considering the predicate correlation and null values. In merging CSs, each predicate belongs to only a property set, i.e., predicate partitioning. Thus, CoPMP has the advantages of both property table and vertical partitioning for query optimization. We allocate merged tables into data blocks based on subject hash partitioning, considering that CS is from the same subject. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates the efficiency and scalability of our system.", "venue": "International Workshop on the Semantic Web", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2149137945", "name": "Hongshen Yu"}, {"authorId": "1379512042", "name": "Tenglong Ren"}, {"authorId": "1780738", "name": "Xiaowang Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2159829800", "name": "Lulu Yang"}, {"authorId": "2070792626", "name": "Guopeng Zheng"}], "citations": []}
