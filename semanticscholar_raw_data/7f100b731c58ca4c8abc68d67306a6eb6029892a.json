The Environmental Impact of Testing Open Source Java Projects", "abstract": "As we have come to rely on software systems in our daily lives, we have a clear expectation about the reliability of these systems. To ensure this reliability, automated software quality assurance processes have become an important part of software development. However, given the climate crisis that we are witnessing, it is important to ask ourselves what the impact of all these automated quality assurance processes is in terms of electricity consumption. This study explores the electricity consumption and potential environmental impact of continuous integration and software testing in 10 open source software projects.", "venue": "", "year": null, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "1702285", "name": "A.
