Although utilizing this advanced construction method can greatly improve the working environment and productivity, the conventional mentality in construction, which historically overlooks the value of an automated management system to support off-site prefabrication and on-site installation, hinders its application. This research introduces an Internet of things (IoT)-based shop floor material management system that can capture dynamic data in real-time and effectively synthesize it along the supply chain. With the assistance of a feature-based modelling method, real-time information can be merged into an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system rather than manually inputting data. Through the research presented in this article, IoT-based shop floor material management is shown to be highly effective in addressing dynamic changes in a cost-effective manner. As demonstrated in a case study, the proposed system can lead to cost reduction, improved efficiency, and improved compliance with just-in-time (JIT) inventory management principles.
