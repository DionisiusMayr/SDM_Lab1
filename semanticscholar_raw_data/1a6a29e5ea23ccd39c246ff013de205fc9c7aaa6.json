Such load can be significantly contained by directly sharing content among nearby users through device-to-device (D2D) communications, so that repeated downloads of the same data can be avoided as much as possible. Accordingly, for the purpose of improving the efficiency of content sharing and decreasing the load on the eNB, it is important to maximize the number of simultaneous D2D transmissions. Specially, maximizing the number of D2D links can not only improve spectrum and energy efficiency but can also reduce transmission delay. However, enabling maximum D2D links in a cellular network poses two major challenges. First, the interference between the D2D and cellular communications could critically affect their performance. Second, the minimum quality of service (QoS) requirement of cellular and D2D communication must be guaranteed. Therefore, a selection of active links is critical to gain the maximum number of D2D links. This can be formulated as a classical integer linear programming problem (link scheduling) that is known to be NP-hard. This paper proposes to obtain a set of network features via deep learning for solving this challenging problem. The idea is to optimize the D2D link schedule problem with a deep neural network (DNN). This makes a significant time reduction for delay-sensitive operations, since the computational overhead is mainly spent in the training process of the model. The simulation performed on a randomly generated link schedule problem showed that our algorithm is capable of finding satisfactory D2D link scheduling solutions by reducing computation time up to 90% without significantly affecting their accuracy.", "venue": "Italian National Conference on Sensors", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2019-07-01", "journal": {"name": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "volume": "19"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1384418048", "name": "Bocheng Yu"}, {"authorId": "49469937", "name": "Xingjun Zhang"}, {"authorId": "39229524", "name": "F.
