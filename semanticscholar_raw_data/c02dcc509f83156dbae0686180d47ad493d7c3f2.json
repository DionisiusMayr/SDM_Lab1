Attackers utilize such means of communication and create malicious URLs to conduct fraudulent activities and deceive others by creating deceptive and misleading websites and domains. Such threats open the doors for many critical attacks such as spams, spyware, phishing, and malware. Therefore, detecting malicious URL is crucially important to prevent the occurrence of many cybercriminal activities. In this study, we examined a set of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models to detect malicious websites using a dataset comprising 66,506 records of URLs. We engineered three different types of features including lexical-based, network-based and content-based features. To extract the most discriminative features in the dataset, we applied several features selection algorithms, namely, correlation analysis, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), and chi-square. Finally, we conducted a comparative performance evaluation for several ML and DL models considering set of criteria commonly used to evaluate such models. Results depicted that Na\u00efve Bayes (NB) was the best model for detecting malicious URLs using the applied data with an accuracy of 96%. This research has made contribution to the field by conducting significant features engineering and analysis to identify the best features for malicious URLs predictions, compare different models and achieve a high accuracy using a large new URL dataset.", "venue": "Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-08-25", "journal": {"name": "Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience", "volume": "2022"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1985357", "name": "M.
