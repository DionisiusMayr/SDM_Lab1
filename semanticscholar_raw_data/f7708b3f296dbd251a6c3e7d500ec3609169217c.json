Recent literature points out several factors that influence the adoption of big data. However, enterprises often resist using the business value of big data due to a lack of knowledge. The purpose of this study is to investigate the factors influencing big data adoption by Chinese enterprises and to develop an indicator system based on the Motivation\u2013Opportunity\u2013Ability (MOA) model. Moreover, the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method is used to construct a network relationship map and to analyze its effects. Using the DEMATEL-based Analytic Network Process (ANP) (DANP) method to identify the weight distribution of index, this study quantitatively evaluates the influencing factors. The results show that leadership support, perceived usefulness, financial support, data resources, industrial development, data talents, and technical capability are key elements affecting the application of big data. Accordingly, some targeted suggestions are proposed.", "venue": "Sustainability", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Economics"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2018-10-30", "journal": {"name": "Sustainability"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2152511477", "name": "Lei Wang"}, {"authorId": "30735424", "name": "Mengke Yang"}, {"authorId": "25505964", "name": "Zulfiqar Hussain Pathan"}, {"authorId": "35437776", "name": "S.
