Data aggregation has become an absolute necessity for some IoT applications. In this sense, several aggregation schemes have been proposed but have dealt with security issues. Data confidentiality, authentication, and integrity are the primary security requirements for this type of aggregation scheme. In this paper, we are interested in authentication and data integrity. We present the most used signature algorithms, namely, ECDSA and BLS. We analyze these two signature schemes regarding security, the efficiency of calculations, and communications. In fact, we show that in the case of200 IoT devices, the aggregator needs 48,24 ms to perform a batch verification with ECDSA, while 289,44 ms are needed with BLS. Finally, we present a comparative study and recommendations for use.", "venue": "International Conference on Advances in Electrical Engineering", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-10-29", "journal": {"name": "2022 2nd International Conference on Advanced Electrical Engineering (ICAEE)", "pages": "1-6"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2193010502", "name": "Mehdi Madjid Abbas"}, {"authorId": "2042536593", "name": "Omar Rafik Merad-Boudia"}], "citations": []}
