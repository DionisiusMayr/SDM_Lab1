A cross-platform query optimizer is necessary to enable applications to run their tasks over multiple platforms efficiently and in a platform-agnostic manner. For the optimizer to be effective, it must consider data movement costs across different data processing platforms. In this paper, we present the graph-based data movement strategy used by Rheem, our open-source cross-platform system. In particular, we (i) model the data movement problem as a new graph problem, which we prove to be NP-hard, and (ii) propose a novel graph exploration algorithm, which allows Rheem to discover multiple hidden opportunities for cross-platform data processing.", "venue": "IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2019-04-01", "journal": {"name": "2019 IEEE 35th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE)", "pages": "1642-1645"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "143924672", "name": "Sebastian Kruse"}, {"authorId": "2827559", "name": "Zoi Kaoudi"}, {"authorId": "1399355221", "name": "Jorge-Arnulfo Quian\u00e9-Ruiz"}, {"authorId": "50793091", "name": "S.
