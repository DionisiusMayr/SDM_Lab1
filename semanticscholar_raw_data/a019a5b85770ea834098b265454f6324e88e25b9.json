In the field of education, both educational organizations and students are the target beneficiaries. It facilitates the educational sector in predicting the student\u2019s outcome at the end of their course and for the students in deciding to choose a suitable course for them based on their performances in previous exams and other behavioral features. In this study, a systematic literature review is performed to extract the algorithms and the features that have been used in the prediction studies. Based on the search criteria, 2700 articles were initially considered. Using specified inclusion and exclusion criteria, quality scores were provided, and up to 56 articles were filtered for further analysis. The utmost care was taken in studying the features utilized, database used, algorithms implemented, and the future directions as recommended by researchers. The features were classified as demographic, academic, and behavioral features, and finally, only 34 articles with these features were finalized, whose details of study are provided. Based on the results obtained from the systematic review, we conclude that the machine learning techniques have the ability to predict the students\u2019 performance based on specified features as categorized and can be used by students as well as academic institutions. A specific machine learning model identification for the purpose of student academic performance prediction would not be feasible, since each paper taken for review involves different datasets and does not include benchmark datasets. However, the application of the machine learning techniques in educational mining is still limited, and a greater number of studies should be carried out in order to obtain well-formed and generalizable results. We provide future guidelines to practitioners and researchers based on the results obtained in this work.", "venue": "Applied Sciences", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2021-10-26", "journal": {"name": "Applied Sciences"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2066203352", "name": "P.
