Within the contemporary debates on the impact of Big Data on the nature of higher education research and the effective ways to harmonize Big Data practice with privacy restrictions and regulations, this study sets out to qualitatively examine current issues regarding data privacy, anonymity, informed consent and confidentiality in data-centric higher education research, with a focus on the data collector, data subject and data user. We argue that within current regulations, data protection of research subjects concerns more data collection and disclosure and insufficiently describes use, having procedural implications for both the complex nature of higher education (HE) research and the type of research data being collected. We work our argument through an examination of several factors that call for a reconsideration of data privacy and access to private information in HE research. The conclusions indicate that Big Data-centric HE research is increasingly becoming a mainstream research paradigm which needs to address critical data privacy issues before being widely embraced.", "venue": "Sustainability", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2020-10-21", "journal": {"name": "Sustainability"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "153270373", "name": "Diana Florea"}, {"authorId": "118174866", "name": "S.
