In particular, the document focuses on the techniques developed for supporting controlled data sharing for collaborative queries and \ufb01ne-grained data retrieval. The model and techniques described enable the involvement of the data market in the execution of queries over data stored either in plaintext or encrypted form, possibly delegating parts of the execution to external parties when economically convenient while fully respecting the security policies associated with data. During the query execution, data can be dynamically wrapped and un-wrapped to regulate visibility over them. Fine-grained data retrieval is instead supported through the de\ufb01nition of a multi-dimensional index that is robust against inference exposure and supports the ef\ufb01cient execution of point and range queries over encrypted data. The experimental evaluation over a dataset with 3.2M data items shows that the multi-dimensional index performs well for query execution and requires limited storage at the client-side", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2087590807", "name": "MOSAICrOWN Consortium"}], "citations": []}
