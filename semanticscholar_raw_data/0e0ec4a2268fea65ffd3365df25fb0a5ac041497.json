When it entered into the era of big data, Digital Earth developed into a new stage, namely one characterized by \u2018Big Earth Data\u2019, confronting new challenges and opportunities. In this paper we give an overview of the development of Digital Earth by summarizing research achievements and marking the milestones of Digital Earth\u2019s development. Then, the opportunities and challenges that Big Earth Data faces are discussed. As a data-intensive scientific research approach, Big Earth Data provides a new vision and methodology to Earth sciences, and the paper identifies the advantages of Big Earth Data to scientific research, especially in knowledge discovery and global change research. We believe that Big Earth Data will advance and promote the development of Digital Earth.", "venue": "International Journal of Digital Earth", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Geography", "Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2017-01-02", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Digital Earth", "pages": "1 - 12", "volume": "10"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "145872183", "name": "Huadong Guo"}, {"authorId": "46270580", "name": "Z.
