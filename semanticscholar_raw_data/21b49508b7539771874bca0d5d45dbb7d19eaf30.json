One approach to automating data processing pipelines is the workflow technology, as it also supports collaborative, trial-and-error experimentation with the pipeline architecture in different application domains. In addition to the necessary flexibility that such pipelines need to possess, in collaborative settings cross-organisational interactions are plagued by lack of trust. While capturing provenance information related to the pipeline execution and the processed data is a first step towards enabling trusted collaborations, the current solutions do not allow for provenance of the change in the processing pipelines, where the subject of change can be made on any aspect of the workflow implementing the pipeline and on the data used while the pipeline is being executed. Therefore in this work we provide a solution architecture and a proof of concept implementation of a service, called Provenance Holder, which enable provenance of collaborative, adaptive data processing pipelines in a trusted manner. We also contribute a definition of a set of properties of such a service and identify future research directions.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-10-17", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2310.11442"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2069337215", "name": "Ludwig Stage"}, {"authorId": "143727987", "name": "Dimka Karastoyanova"}], "citations": []}
