Driven by market demand and the development of science and technology, the organisational model of the production system has evolved, which has in turn caused changes in the methods of production scheduling. In the context of the newest industrial revolution (Industry 4.0), this review aims to examine the evolution of production scheduling in terms of economics and technology. First, literature on production scheduling is summarised and analysed from the perspectives of centralised/decentralised scheduling, distributed scheduling, and cloud manufacturing scheduling. Second, future challenges and trends in the development of production scheduling are discussed in view of the globalisation of manufacturing and changes in production modes enabled by new technologies. Finally, based on the findings of this review, we make a prediction for the future expansions of the customer-centric value chain as well as changes in product design and production methods brought by product personalisation.", "venue": "International Journal of Production Research", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2021-05-19", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Production Research", "pages": "3534 -
