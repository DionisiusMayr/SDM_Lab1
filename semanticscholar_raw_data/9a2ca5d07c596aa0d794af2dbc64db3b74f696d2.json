Nerve cell activity of brain is disturbed which repeated seizures and disrupts the normal life of human. The nerve cells are connected with each other in complex way to communicate with each other. Epilepsy is neurological disorder where these nerve cells function in different way. This can be evaluated with help of Electroencephalogram (EEG) and Electrocorticography (ECoG) monitoring. Electroencephalogram help to check the signals of brain through images. These when monitored through machine learning system can help to evaluate whether the person has epilepsy disorder. The high-volume data is used to classify the disorder with machine learning classifier and statistical features The system is implemented with convolutional neural network for high dataset of image of signals of Electroencephalogram to classify the disorder. The research is ongoing where the performance is evaluated with different classifier and features.", "venue": "International Journal For Multidisciplinary Research", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-10-31", "journal": {"name": "International Journal For Multidisciplinary Research"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2266669721", "name": "Mr. Satish Ukade"}, {"authorId": "2266662976", "name": "Dr. S.
