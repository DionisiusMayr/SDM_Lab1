By the use of IOT, various physical things can communicate, interact and exchange data seamlessly. IOT brings intelligence and automation in different areas like agriculture, transportation, industry, health and many more. The ultimate goal of the IOT applications is to increase comfort and efficiency of the users. IOT architecture comprises of various objects and things which are connected to open network. This openness/this exposure provides fertile ground for various types of security attacks. Security and Protection are the significant perspective of IOT Network. Conventional Security approaches can't be applied directly to the resource constrained network. Authentication confirms the identity of each individual registered entity in the network. It is very much important to verify and validate identity of device as compromised device can damage to the network. IOT applications can significantly be useful to society when these security issues at each layer (Perception, Network and Application) are analyzed and solved. In this paper, a detailed review of the security related challenges specially related to Authentication and source of threats in IOT applications is discussed.", "venue": "2020 IEEE International Conference for Innovation in Technology (INOCON)", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2020-11-06", "journal": {"name": "2020 IEEE International Conference for Innovation in Technology (INOCON)", "pages": "1-6"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "79525172", "name": "M.
