However, do users welcome different perspectives or only listen to their preferred narratives? This paper examines how users explore the digital space and allocate their attention among communities on two social networks, Voat and Reddit. By analysing a massive dataset of about 215 million comments posted by about 16 million users on Voat and Reddit in 2019 we find that most users tend to explore new communities at a decreasing rate, meaning they have a limited set of preferred groups they visit regularly. Moreover, we provide evidence that preferred communities of users tend to cover similar topics throughout the year. We also find that communities have a high turnover of users, meaning that users come and go frequently showing a high volatility that strongly departs from a null model simulating users' behaviour.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Physics"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-04-21", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2304.10827"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2112655298", "name": "Niccol\u00f2 Di Marco"}, {"authorId": "3468616", "name": "Matteo Cinelli"}, {"authorId": "2215168777", "name": "Shayan Alipour"}, {"authorId": "1728390", "name": "Walter Quattrociocchi"}], "citations": []}
