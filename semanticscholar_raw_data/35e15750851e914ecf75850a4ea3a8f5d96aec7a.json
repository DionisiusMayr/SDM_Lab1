We undertook a survey around Universities in Ho Chi Minh City and Tien Giang University, Vietnam focused on freshmen and sophomores to assess library service quality for improving the learning service quality. Machine learning has been deployed for predicting the library service, quality, and has been adopted successfully in depicting the assessment results. To perform the effectiveness of data, the Convolution Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (Conv-BiLSTM), and Convolution Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (ConvBiGRU) were used. The models have illustrated appropriate performances when providing sufficient accuracy and extracting the prediction of the output.", "venue": "CTU Journal of Innovation and Sustainable Development", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-10-16", "journal": {"name": "CTU Journal of Innovation and Sustainable Development"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2253603759", "name": "Nguyen Minh Tuan"}, {"authorId": "2264376595", "name": "Meesad Phayung"}, {"authorId": "2264124564", "name": "Van Hieu Duong"}, {"authorId": "2264441165", "name": "Maliyaem Maleerat"}], "citations": []}
