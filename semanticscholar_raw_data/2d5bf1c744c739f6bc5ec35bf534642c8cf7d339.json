The study collected 365 valid responses to assess the impact of the selected factors on librarians\u2019 intentions. Structural equation modeling was employed for statistical analysis.FindingsThe results revealed that attitudes, subjective norms and behavioral controls were significant factors associated with librarians\u2019 intention to engage in virtual storytimes. Among these, attitudinal factors were the most influential; however, organizational support was not a significant factor.Originality/valueMinimal research has been conducted to explore factors associated with online storytime practices, which served as a primary delivery mode during the COVID-19 pandemic.
