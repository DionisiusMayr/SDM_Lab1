In the current scenario, CCTVs (Closed Circuit Televisions) are placed all over for recording the events but it is very difficult to monitor the working of these CCTV (Closed Circuit Televisions) cameras in real time. It requires constant manual monitoring to realize if a camera is not working by looking at the recording screen. This research study proposes a novel method to find faulty cameras by analyzing whether a camera is connected to the internet network or not by using the ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) echo command method to a given server and its reply packets can be used to identify the faulty devices connected to a given network. The turnaround time for manual checking of faulty cameras and raising concern can be reduced drastically by saving more time and most importantly the video surveillance keeps tracking events all the time.", "venue": "2023 2nd International Conference on Applied Artificial Intelligence and Computing (ICAAIC)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-05-04", "journal": {"name": "2023 2nd International Conference on Applied Artificial Intelligence and Computing (ICAAIC)", "pages": "1448-1452"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2219800117", "name": "Mohana Puneeth"}, {"authorId": "2694888", "name": "G.
