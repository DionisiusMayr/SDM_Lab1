In this work, we present a novel clustering method based on an unsupervised manifold learning algorithm, in which a more effective similarity measure is computed by the manifold learning and used for clustering purposes. The proposed approach is applied to anomaly detection in videos and used in combination with different background segmentation methods to improve their effectiveness. An experimental evaluation is conducted on three different image datasets and one video dataset. The obtained results indicate superior accuracy in most clustering tasks when compared to the baselines. Results also demonstrate that the clustering step can improve the results of background subtraction approaches in the majority of cases.", "venue": "VISIGRAPP", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"pages": "404-412"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2075423966", "name": "Leonardo Tadeu Lopes"}, {"authorId": "3344401", "name": "Lucas Pascotti Valem"}, {"authorId": "144869373", "name": "D.
