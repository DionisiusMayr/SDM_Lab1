This solution has emerged towards several industries such as Financial Services, Energy, Logistics, Life Science and Healthcare and has shown a crucial impact for predictive decisions in this area. This work seeks to describe the solution strategy of this tool for data scientist by depicting a depth insight of this concept which contains more 1500 native algorithms, data preparation and data science functions. This features allows professionals to support any machine learning libraries and integrate python and R codes. RapidMiner offers three different modalities to access to their products which are the main Platform, the automated data science and the AI cloud.", "venue": "Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Digital Tools & Uses Congress", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2020-10-15", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Digital Tools & Uses Congress"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2034204180", "name": "Mohamed Bjaoui"}, {"authorId": "48810077", "name": "Houneida Sakly"}, {"authorId": "49128178", "name": "Mourad Said"}, {"authorId": "9441889", "name": "N.
