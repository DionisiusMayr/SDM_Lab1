XFL supports training AI models collaboratively on multiple devices, while utilizes homomorphic encryption, differential privacy, secure multi-party computation and other security technologies ensuring no leakage of data. XFL provides an abundant algorithms library, integrating a large number of pre-built, secure and outstanding federated learning algorithms, covering both the horizontally and vertically federated learning scenarios. Numerical experiments have shown the prominent performace of these algorithms. XFL builds a concise configuration interfaces with presettings for all federation algorithms, and supports the rapid deployment via docker containers.Therefore, we believe XFL is the most user-friendly and easy-to-develop federated learning framework. XFL is open-sourced, and both the code and documents are available at https://github.com/paritybit-ai/XFL.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-02-10", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2302.05076"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2144274787", "name": "Hong Wang"}, {"authorId": "2156026497", "name": "Yuanzhi Zhou"}, {"authorId": "2145179679", "name": "Chi Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2205048834", "name": "Chen Peng"}, {"authorId": "47451972", "name": "Mingxia Huang"}, {"authorId": "2153629670", "name": "Yi Liu"}, {"authorId": "1978393184", "name": "Lintao Zhang"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "453d85311169486ad77980db3466677f2b627b9e", "title": "Tournament-Based Pretraining to Accelerate Federated Learning"}, {"paperId": "bfcc0a8309ec8a82c977d77bcb4251168b7a4d5e", "title": "FeLebrities: A User-Centric Assessment of Federated Learning Frameworks"}]}
