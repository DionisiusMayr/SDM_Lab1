Given the iterative nature of model and parameter tuning, many analysts use a small sample of their entire data during their initial stage of analysis to make quick decisions (e.g., what features or hyperparameters to use) and use the entire dataset only in later stages (i.e., when they have converged to a specific model). This sampling, however, is performed in an ad-hoc fashion. Most practitioners cannot precisely capture the effect of sampling on the quality of their model, and eventually on their decision-making process during the tuning phase. Moreover, without systematic support for sampling operators, many optimizations and reuse opportunities are lost. In this paper, we introduce BlinkML, a system for fast, quality-guaranteed ML training. BlinkML allows users to make error-computation tradeoffs: instead of training a model on their full data (i.e., full model), BlinkML can quickly train an approximate model with quality guarantees using a sample. The quality guarantees ensure that, with high probability, the approximate model makes the same predictions as the full model. BlinkML currently supports any ML model that relies on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), which includes Generalized Linear Models (e.g., linear regression, logistic regression, max entropy classifier, Poisson regression) as well as PPCA (Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis). Our experiments show that BlinkML can speed up the training of large-scale ML tasks by 6.26\u00d7?629\u00d7 while guaranteeing the same predictions, with 95% probability, as the full model.", "venue": "SIGMOD Conference", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2018-12-26", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 2019 International Conference on Management of Data"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "40155297", "name": "Yongjoo Park"}, {"authorId": "66845118", "name": "Jingyi Qing"}, {"authorId": "3355904", "name": "Xiaoyang Shen"}, {"authorId": "2198667", "name": "Barzan Mozafari"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "8051afd09d3cd0cd18af049e235970de7af4fc08", "title": "Resampling estimation of discrete choice models"}, {"paperId": "5cbbe911564117fc4ac7c53866c189fe60166cad", "title": "SAGA: A Scalable Framework for Optimizing Data Cleaning Pipelines for Machine Learning Applications"}, {"paperId": "364404aa07f6a06f06b95de7cacfafdcf30d1c72", "title": "Approximate Computing Survey, Part I: Terminology and Software & Hardware Approximation Techniques"}, {"paperId": "15a3fd454031c368af8b9c19180edf16a0203fe6", "title": "Approximate Computing Survey, Part II: Application-Specific & Architectural Approximation Techniques and Applications"}, {"paperId": "9ede4abf03af7693af397a5e0451f0b373760ed2", "title": "AWARE: Workload-aware, Redundancy-exploiting Linear Algebra"}, {"paperId": "d63e9bcf584a322f524f2c6dd868e464879fa01b", "title": "Pricing Prediction Services for Profit Maximization with Incomplete Information"}, {"paperId": "023fbffad88fd923d33c1e3ac33262b396123065", "title": "A Step Toward Deep Online Aggregation"}, {"paperId": "d39a410b08bff56245cde0b06bf72cd54faaff4c", "title": "A survey on machine learning in array databases"}, {"paperId": "92c472e58852967ee4a2ba911fe08de4670d4775", "title": "Automatically Finding Optimal Index Structure"}, {"paperId": "f710caba548a6c48e735fc4646b521b6ba1c8b7b", "title": "Camel: Managing Data for Efficient Stream Learning"}, {"paperId": "0d37a47e67b8b3aed896390b3596fbec77f620d1", "title": "Differentiable and Scalable Generative Adversarial Models for Data Imputation"}, {"paperId": "80f9050f657b5f541ded4ff5d778912a49cf8432", "title": "Airphant: Cloud-oriented Document Indexing"}, {"paperId": "86e5cac3bab43022dcd12542e5c264e828b8591e", "title": "Machine learning over static and dynamic relational data"}, {"paperId": "0936310d0994790f228fb4f93cd3022c567072a0", "title": "The relational data borg is learning"}, {"paperId": "5ad6ad3326ff89a5584c612f27668cb2c576d5b6", "title": "Machine Learning Systems for Intelligent Services in the IoT: A Survey."}, {"paperId": "180a05effc9d39e5524c3714f89e46fe89c0a0e6", "title": "Efficient Join Synopsis Maintenance for Data Warehouse"}, {"paperId": "d1f2bf6775791db4e0ec408254065eff1612c988", "title": "Machine Learning Systems for Intelligent Services in the IoT: A Survey"}, {"paperId": "14fa903f8549c2057f332339fc19d2a2be9a980b", "title": "Computationally efficient univariate filtering for massive data."}, {"paperId": "621108af2dc17bd690478561039c3df92d1e0e19", "title": "Learning Models over Relational Data: A Brief Tutorial"}, {"paperId": "21a7873599da941ed8534e6864bf24a93abc88f9", "title": "Interactive Summarization of Large Document Collections"}, {"paperId": "ec711be5498ab79efc4f813a81f9b60d07be7359", "title": "Machine Learning Systems for Smart Services in the Internet of Things"}, {"paperId": "344df9dec68dbedeff3bb387291ebce6627a8837", "title": "The First ACAIA Workshop : Approximate Computing for Affordable and Interactive Analytics"}, {"paperId": "9780b6ac52336dd58407d60d35a63f7f8c03a2be", "title": "Scalable Uncertainty Management: 13th International Conference, SUM 2019, Compi\u00e8gne, France, December 16\u201318, 2019, Proceedings"}]}
