Cancelable fingerprint templates can effectively prevent privacy breaches and provide strong protection to the original templates. However, to suit resource-constrained IoT devices, oversimplified templates would compromise authentication performance significantly. In addition, the length of existing cancelable fingerprint templates is usually fixed, making them difficult to be deployed in various memory-limited IoT devices. To address these issues, we propose a novel length-flexible lightweight cancelable fingerprint template for privacy-preserving authentication systems in various resource-constrained IoT applications. The proposed cancelable template design primarily consists of two components: 1) length-flexible partial-cancelable feature generation based on the designed reindexing scheme and 2) lightweight cancelable feature generation based on the designed encoding nested difference XOR scheme. Comprehensive experimental results on public databases FVC2002 DB1\u2013DB4 and FVC2004 DB1\u2013DB4 demonstrate that the proposed cancelable fingerprint template achieves equivalent authentication performance to state-of-the-art methods in IoT environments, but our design substantially reduces template storage space and computational cost. More importantly, the proposed length-flexible lightweight cancelable template is suitable for a variety of commercial smart cards (e.g., C5-M.O.S.T. Card Contact Microprocessor Smart Cards CLXSU064KC5). To the best of our knowledge, the proposed method is the first length-flexible lightweight, high-performing cancelable fingerprint template design for resource-constrained IoT applications.", "venue": "IEEE Internet of Things Journal", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-06-26", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Internet of Things Journal", "pages": "877-892", "volume": "10"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "48153875", "name": "Xuefei Yin"}, {"authorId": "47672587", "name": "Song Wang"}, {"authorId": "2153094259", "name": "Yanming Zhu"}, {"authorId": "1713968", "name": "Jiankun Hu"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "e473a5b6c02f56f58ef55b855c78315b5cd3d5ba", "title": "A Fingerprint Based Novel Cancelable Biometric Authentication Technique"}, {"paperId": "8503dcc0539d9cb93015dcd51679da05e6ffee55", "title": "A hierarchical heterogeneous ant colony optimization based fingerprint recognition system"}, {"paperId": "c56344812dd104aefa9e6fa81291a4da4f342d95", "title": "Research on Fingerprint Image Differential Privacy Protection Publishing Method Based on Wavelet Transform and Singular Value Decomposition Technology"}, {"paperId": "a512408cb102427a1013925fd7da260b91221436", "title": "Privacy Preservation of Biometrics Used for IoT Systems Security: Brief Review"}]}
