Such accelerators often require the application to manually manage memory buffers on devices and transfer data between host and device buffers. A programming model that unifies the virtual address space across the host and devices is appealing because it enables automatic memory transfers and simplifies application-level programming. However, the automatic memory transfers can sometimes be redundant, which decreases performance. NVIDIA\u2019s UVM (unified virtual memory) driver provides a unified virtual address space for CPU-GPU programming. This paper identifies redundant memory transfers (RMTs) as a common performance issue with UVM. To address this issue, this paper proposes a data discard directive, and evaluates two implementations of that directive, UvmDiscard and UvmDiscardLazy. This directive exploits application-level knowledge to avoid RMTs. The implementations were integrated with NVIDIA\u2019s open-source UVM driver to demonstrate their usefulness on real-world CUDA UVM applications. For example, the use of the discard directive increases training throughput by 61.2% on a large deep learning application that oversubscribes GPU memory.", "venue": "IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-11-01", "journal": {"name": "2022 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC)", "pages": "27-38"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2653009", "name": "Weixi Zhu"}, {"authorId": "28981429", "name": "Guilherme Cox"}, {"authorId": "1629749335", "name": "J.
