Today, cluster manager developers tackle these problems by developing system-speci\ufb01c best effort heuristics, which achieve scalability by signi\ufb01cantly sacri\ufb01cing the cluster manager\u2019s decision quality, feature set, and extensibility over time. This is proving untenable, as solutions for cluster management problems are routinely developed from scratch in the industry to solve largely similar problems across different settings. We propose DCM, a radically different architecture where developers specify the cluster manager\u2019s behavior declaratively, using SQL queries over cluster state stored in a relational database. From the SQL speci\ufb01cation, the DCM compiler synthesizes a program that, at runtime, can be invoked to compute policy-compliant cluster management decisions given the latest cluster state. Under the covers, the generated program ef\ufb01ciently encodes the cluster state as an optimization problem that can be solved using off-the-shelf solvers, freeing developers from having to design ad-hoc heuristics. We show that DCM signi\ufb01cantly lowers the barrier to building scalable and extensible cluster managers. We validate our claim by powering three production-grade systems with it: a Kubernetes scheduler, a virtual machine management solu-tion, and a distributed transactional datastore.", "venue": "", "year": null, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2258740767", "name": "Systems Design"}, {"authorId": "49060428", "name": "L.
