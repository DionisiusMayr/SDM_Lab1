It contributes to an overarching view of the research domain, serving as a guiding framework for the advancement of future investigations.", "venue": "Revista de Gest\u00e3o Social e Ambiental", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2024-01-29", "journal": {"name": "Revista de Gest\u00e3o Social e Ambiental"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2260651750", "name": "Jo\u00e3o C\u00e9sar de Souza Ferreira"}, {"authorId": "2281997178", "name": "Pedro Henrique Pereira Dos Santos"}], "citations": []}
