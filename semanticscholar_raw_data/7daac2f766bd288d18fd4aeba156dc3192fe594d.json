Though cloud computing has many advantages, there are also substantial security issues related to confidentiality, integrity, privacy, and availability. Being a relatively new discipline, cloud forensics faces numerous challenges and issues with interpreting and analyzing data. Forensic investigators and law enforcement confront numerous difficulties in data collection, data protection, and evidence access. Several sophisticated models have been proposed in recent years aiming to accelerate the entire investigation process or address several issues that arise frequently in forensic investigations. This review paper seeks to comprehend the significance of various machine learning models which would help cloud forensics advance significantly. It also provides a detail information on cloud forensics as well as the research trends that have been going on in this field over the past few years. A detailed comparative analysis of different approaches of machine learning on development of cloud forensics has been presented in this research study.", "venue": "2023 International Conference on Sustainable Computing and Smart Systems (ICSCSS)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-06-14", "journal": {"name": "2023 International Conference on Sustainable Computing and Smart Systems (ICSCSS)", "pages": "1-11"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2221253705", "name": "Malluri Reddy Theertani"}, {"authorId": "2221254508", "name": "Neha Valeti"}, {"authorId": "2221243962", "name": "Darshini Solanki"}, {"authorId": "2110685150", "name": "K.
