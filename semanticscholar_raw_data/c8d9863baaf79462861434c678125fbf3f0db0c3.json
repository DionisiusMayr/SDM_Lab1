However, relatively few studies have been devoted to systematically review the results in this field. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to explore the general characteristics of the application of the big data approach in urban mobility research. For this purpose, the systematic literature review method was applied and the scientific Scopus database was accessed to collect publications relevant to the predefined criteria. Then the papers included in the sample were analysed using quantitative and qualitative techniques, focusing on the trends emerging from the years of publications in the database, the distribution of the papers by journal, the geographical distribution of case-study areas, the methods and data types employed, and their policy implications. This literature review demonstrates the diversity of big datadriven urban mobility research and provides lessons for geography and urban policy in Hungary.", "venue": "Modern Geogr\u00e1fia", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-11-01", "journal": {"name": "Modern Geogr\u00e1fia"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2190638196", "name": "S\u00e1ndor V\u00e1czi"}, {"authorId": "2091100002", "name": "Szabolcs Fabula"}, {"authorId": "2111732715", "name": "G\u00e1bor Nagy"}], "citations": []}
