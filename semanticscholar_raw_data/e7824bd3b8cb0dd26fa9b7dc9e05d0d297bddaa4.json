Distributed stream processing has become key to analyzing data generated by these connected devices and improving our ability to make decisions. However, optimizing these systems towards specific Quality of Service targets is a difficult and time-consuming task, due to the large-scale distributed systems involved, the existence of so many configuration parameters, and the inability to easily determine the impact of tuning these parameters.In this paper we present an approach for the effective testing of system configurations for critical IoT analytics pipelines. We demonstrate our approach with a prototype that we called Timon which is integrated with Kubernetes. This tool allows pipelines to be easily replicated in parallel and evaluated to determine the optimal configuration for specific applications. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach by investigating different configurations of an exemplary geographically-based traffic monitoring application implemented in Apache Flink.", "venue": "2019 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2019-12-01", "journal": {"name": "2019 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "pages": "4157-4162"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "88355634", "name": "Morgan K.
