However, the SSD efficiency is usually determined by many hardware parameters, making it hard for developers to manually tune them and determine the optimized SSD hardware configurations.In this paper, we present an automated learning-based SSD hardware configuration framework, named AutoBlox, that utilizes both supervised and unsupervised machine learning (ML) techniques to drive the tuning of hardware configurations for SSDs. Auto-Blox automatically extracts the unique access patterns of a new workload using its block I/O traces, maps the workload to previous workloads for utilizing the learned experiences, and recommends an optimized SSD configuration based on the validated storage performance. AutoBlox accelerates the development of new SSD devices by automating the hardware parameter configurations and reducing the manual efforts. We develop AutoBlox with simple yet effective learning algorithms that can run efficiently on multi-core CPUs. Given a target storage workload, our evaluation shows that AutoBlox can deliver an optimized SSD configuration that can improve the performance of the target workload by 1.30\u00d7 on average, compared to commodity SSDs, while satisfying specified constraints such as SSD capacity, device interfaces, and power budget. And this configuration will maximize the performance improvement for both target workloads and non-target workloads.CCS CONCEPTS\u2022 Hardware \u2192 External storage; \u2022 Computer systems organization \u2192 Architectures; \u2022 Computing methodologies\u2192Machine learning algorithms.", "venue": "Micro", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-10-28", "journal": {"name": "2023 56th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO)", "pages": "1289-1304"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1605885812", "name": "Daixuan Li"}, {"authorId": "46968806", "name": "Jinghan Sun"}, {"authorId": "2154937884", "name": "Jian Huang"}], "citations": []}
