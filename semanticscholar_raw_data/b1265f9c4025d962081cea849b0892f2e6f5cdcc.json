Traditional analytical methods, often limited to laboratory-scale., may not effectively detect adulteration and fraud in complex applications. Raman spectroscopy (RS), encompassing techniques like Surface-enhanced RS (SERS), Dispersive RS (DRS), Fourier transform RS (FTRS), Resonance Raman spectroscopy (RRS), and Spatially offset RS (SORS) combined with chemometrics, presents a potent approach for both qualitative and quantitative analysis of muscle food adulteration. This technology is characterized by its efficiency, rapidity, and noninvasive nature. This paper systematically summarizes and comparatively analyzes RS technology principles, emphasizing its practicality and efficacy in detecting muscle food adulteration and fraud when combined with chemometrics. The paper also discusses the existing challenges and future prospects in this field, providing essential insights for reviews and scientific research in related fields.", "venue": "Critical reviews in food science and nutrition", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-03-24", "journal": {"name": "Critical reviews in food science and nutrition", "pages": "\n          1-23\n        "}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2212861175", "name": "Haiyang Ma"}, {"authorId": "2293433581", "name": "Jiajun Guo"}, {"authorId": "2293350155", "name": "Guishan Liu"}, {"authorId": "2293302088", "name": "Delang Xie"}, {"authorId": "2293555858", "name": "Bingbing Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2233542135", "name": "Xiaojun Li"}, {"authorId": "2293564635", "name": "Qian Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2293266442", "name": "Qingqing Cao"}, {"authorId": "2293315305", "name": "Xiaoxue Li"}, {"authorId": "2293426996", "name": "Fang Ma"}, {"authorId": "2293359208", "name": "Yang Li"}, {"authorId": "1573363704", "name": "Guoling Wan"}, {"authorId": "2293349224", "name": "Yan Li"}, {"authorId": "2293656267", "name": "Di Wu"}, {"authorId": "2233602487", "name": "Ping Ma"}, {"authorId": "2151671137", "name": "Mei Guo"}, {"authorId": "2293894969", "name": "Junjie Yin"}], "citations": []}
