There are different platforms available, in which cyber-attacks are performed. Due to these attacks users important information are leaked such as personal documents and other private documents. In this method perform image encryption and decryption technique that is based prime number key. This proposed method use random pixel shifting method for image encryption. In this method image pixels are shifted on different place on the basis on formula that\u2019s worked on homogenous equation. In this thesis work also discuss the different attacks on encrypted image such noise attacks. The proposed novel approach shows better result as compare other method in terms of encryption and decryption of secure image. There are different result parameters are available to check the quality of encrypted and decrypted image such as peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), mean square error (MSE), and structure similarity index measurement (SSIM).", "venue": "International Journal of Trend in Scientific Research and Development", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2018-10-13", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Trend in Scientific Research and Development"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "98553112", "name": "A.
