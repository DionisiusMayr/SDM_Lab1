We first document substantial herding behavior that is stronger when market returns are positive. Herding is negatively related to both the level and cross-sectional dispersion of investor attention. Moreover, there are pronounced intraday variations: Market return herding exhibits similar patterns as attention and blockchain activity and is strongest during the overlap of hours when traders in major economic centers are likely awake.", "venue": "Social Science Research Network", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-10-05", "journal": {"name": "Behavioral & Experimental Finance eJournal"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1383272084", "name": "Stefan Scharnowski"}, {"authorId": "95092726", "name": "Yanghua Shi"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "16b96318660be49ffde36fd1d40558bbc851e0a9", "title": "Detect Informed Trading in Cryptocurrency: Can On-Chain Trades Predict Return of Ether?"}]}
