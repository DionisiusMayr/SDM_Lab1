The reason is that, in these systems, the strike of a single energetic particle can upset one or more adjacent bits. In this article, we present a simple solution for this problem based on integer codes capable of correcting single errors and detecting <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${l}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-bit burst errors confined to a <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${b}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-bit byte (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$1 {\\, < \\,} l {\\, < \\,} {b}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>). Unlike the classical approach, the proposed one does not rely on the use of dedicated encoding/decoding hardware. Instead, it uses the processor as both encoder and decoder. The effectiveness of such solution is demonstrated on a theoretical model of an eight-core processor. The obtained results show that it has the potential to be used in future DDR5 systems.", "venue": "IEEE transactions on device and materials reliability", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2020-12-01", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Transactions on Device and Materials Reliability", "pages": "748-753", "volume": "20"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "145240062", "name": "A.
