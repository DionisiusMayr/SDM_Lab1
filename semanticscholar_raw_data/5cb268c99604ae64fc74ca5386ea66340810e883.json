As manufacturing advances and user demands evolve, space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGIN) with computational capabilities emerge as a viable solution for services requiring low latency and high computational power. Resource management within joint communication and computing-embedded SAGIN (JCC-SAGIN) presents greater complexity than traditional terrestrial networks. This complexity arises from the spatiotemporal dynamics of network topology and service demand, the interdependency of large-scale resource variables, and intricate tradeoffs among various performance metrics. Thus, a thorough examination of resource management strategies in JCC-SAGIN is crucial, emphasizing the role of non-terrestrial platforms with processing capabilities in 6G. This paper begins by reviewing the architecture, enabling technologies, and applications in JCC-SAGIN. Then, we offer a detailed overview of resource management modeling and optimization methods, encompassing both traditional optimization approaches and learning-based intelligent decision-making frameworks. Finally, we outline the prospective research directions in JCC-SAGIN.", "venue": "", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2024-03-26", "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2146378610", "name": "Qian Chen"}, {"authorId": "2293412722", "name": "Zheng Guo"}, {"authorId": "2288978310", "name": "Weixiao Meng"}, {"authorId": "2293668953", "name": "Shuai Han"}, {"authorId": "2261668728", "name": "Cheng Li"}, {"authorId": "2293393953", "name": "Tony Q.
