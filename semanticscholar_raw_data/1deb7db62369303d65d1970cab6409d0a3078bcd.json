A novel compiler implementation allows RaSQL to map declarative queries into one basic fixpoint operator supporting aggregates in recursive queries. A fully optimized implementation of this fixpoint operator leads to superior performance, scalability and portability. Thus, our RaSQL system, which extends Spark SQL with the before-mentioned new constructs and implementation techniques, matches and often surpasses the performance of other systems, including Apache Giraph, GraphX and Myria.", "venue": "SIGMOD Conference", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2019-06-25", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 2019 International Conference on Management of Data"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2150059168", "name": "Jiaqi Gu"}, {"authorId": "1996232901", "name": "Yugo H.
