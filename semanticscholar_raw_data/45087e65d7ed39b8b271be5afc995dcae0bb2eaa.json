However, their heterogeneous and resource-constrained nature makes them vulnerable to a wide range of threats. Therefore, there is an urgent need for novel security mechanisms such as accurate and efficient anomaly-based intrusion detection systems (AIDSs) to be developed before these networks reach their full potential. Nevertheless, there is a lack of up-to-date, representative, and well-structured IoT/IIoT-specific datasets which are publicly available and constitute benchmark datasets for training and evaluating machine learning models used in AIDSs for IoT/IIoT networks. Contribution to filling this research gap is the main target of our recent research work and thus, we focus on the generation of new labelled IoT/IIoT-specific datasets by utilising the Cooja simulator. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the Cooja simulator is used, in a systematic way, to generate comprehensive IoT/IIoT datasets. In this paper, we present the approach that we followed to generate an initial set of benign and malicious IoT/IIoT datasets. The generated IIoT-specific information was captured from the Contiki plugin \u201cpowertrace\u201d and the Cooja tool \u201cRadio messages\u201d.", "venue": "Italian National Conference on Sensors", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-02-01", "journal": {"name": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "volume": "21"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "101463968", "name": "Ismael Essop"}, {"authorId": "2073117316", "name": "J.
