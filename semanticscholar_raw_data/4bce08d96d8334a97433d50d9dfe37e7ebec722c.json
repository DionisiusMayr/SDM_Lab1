Computing multi-way joins, as one of the central algorithmic problems in databases, has received much attention recently. This paper surveys some of the recent algorithms, as well as lower bounds. We focus on multi-round algorithms, while referring readers to [27] for single-round algorithms.", "venue": "SIGMOD record", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2020-12-17", "journal": {"name": "ACM SIGMOD Record", "pages": "6 - 17", "volume": "49"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2218084191", "name": "Xiao Hu"}, {"authorId": "144744111", "name": "K.
