However, due to the growth of number of devices, it becomes necessary to implement techniques to select most suitable sensors for each task. This approach is important to make possible to execute applications, where low latency requirements are present. Thus, several works were dedicated to the study on how to search, index, and rank sensors to overcome these challenges. A method, called GoAT, is presented in this paper to rank sensors based on the theory of active perception. The solution was evaluated using four real datasets. Our results successfully demonstrate that the proposal solution can provide an interesting level of reliability of the utilization of sensor data. Furthermore, GoAT requires a low computational resource, and at the same time, reduces latency in the sensor selection process.", "venue": "International Conference on Cloud Computing and Services Science", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"pages": "169-177"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "145748016", "name": "F.
