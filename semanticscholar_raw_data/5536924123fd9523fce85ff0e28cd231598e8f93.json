Major aspects of building control systems are pointed out. It is also stated that the technologies currently used on railroad transport are behind the times and in the 21st century total application of the former seems to be an anachronism. The authors of the article suggested unique concepts of building transport systems oriented towards the use of information technologies and modern optimized power systems. The example of building an intelligent train movements controlling system with alternative energy (<<green\u00bb energy) sources agreeable to the new concept of a smart grid train movements controlling system was presented in the article.", "venue": "East-West Design & Test Symposium", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2018-09-01", "journal": {"name": "2018 IEEE East-West Design & Test Symposium (EWDTS)", "pages": "1-8"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "50815522", "name": "D.
