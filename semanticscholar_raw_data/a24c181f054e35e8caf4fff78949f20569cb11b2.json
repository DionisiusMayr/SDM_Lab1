The Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model has been widely used for forecasting air temperature, but generally it has a systematic bias due to its coarse grid resolution and lack of parametrizations. This study used random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), artificial neural network (ANN) and a multi\u2010model ensemble (MME) to correct the Local Data Assimilation and Prediction System (LDAPS; a local NWP model over Korea) model outputs of next\u2010day maximum and minimum air temperatures ( Tmaxt+1 and Tmint+1 ) in Seoul, South Korea. A total of 14 LDAPS model forecast data, the daily maximum and minimum air temperatures of in\u2010situ observations, and five auxiliary data were used as input variables. The results showed that the LDAPS model had an R2 of 0.69, a bias of \u22120.85 \u00b0C and an RMSE of 2.08 \u00b0C for Tmaxt+1 forecast, whereas the proposed models resulted in the improvement with R2 from 0.75 to 0.78, bias from \u22120.16 to \u22120.07 \u00b0C and RMSE from 1.55 to 1.66 \u00b0C by hindcast validation. For forecasting Tmint+1 , the LDAPS model had an R2 of 0.77, a bias of 0.51 \u00b0C and an RMSE of 1.43 \u00b0C by hindcast, while the bias correction models showed R2 values ranging from 0.86 to 0.87, biases from \u22120.03 to 0.03 \u00b0C, and RMSEs from 0.98 to 1.02 \u00b0C. The MME model had better generalization performance than the three single machine learning models by hindcast validation and leave\u2010one\u2010station\u2010out cross\u2010validation.", "venue": "Earth and Space Science", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2020-03-28", "journal": {"name": "Earth and Space Science", "volume": "7"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "49767068", "name": "Dongjin Cho"}, {"authorId": "40912170", "name": "C.
