The oral message algorithm's implementation was tested and compared to the signed message algorithm adapted to the blogosphere example. The work showed that the problem of the Byzantine generals poses a significant threat to the correct operation of the network. However, it has also been proven that, based on authentication methods, it is possible to implement an algorithm that allows for the detection of fraud attempts and an appropriate reaction without the need for many recursive calls. A further research direction was also proposed - adapting the above algorithm to situations where not all servers will receive complete information from other nodes.", "venue": "Informatics", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-11-23", "journal": {"name": "2022 IEEE 16th International Scientific Conference on Informatics (Informatics)", "pages": "273-279"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2213657947", "name": "Sergiusz Slawczyk"}, {"authorId": "1403809434", "name": "Olga Siedlecka-Lamch"}], "citations": []}
