A BCR-ABL molecular dataset was used to calculate graph edit distances between pharmacophores and led to their organization into a novel pharmacophore network. The application of a graph layout algorithm allowed us to discriminate between the pharmacophores associated with active compounds and those associated with inactive compounds. A clustering approach was used to refine the partitioning by grouping the pharmacophores based on their structures, activities, and binding modes. Analysis of a newly spatialized pharmacophore network provided us with critical insight into structure-activity relationships, most notably those that revealed distinctions between activity classes and chemical families. As shown, this method permits us to identify families of structurally homogeneous pharmacophores.", "venue": "Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-01-26", "journal": {"name": "Journal of chemical information and modeling"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2151267956", "name": "Damien Geslin"}, {"authorId": "2615578", "name": "Alban Lepailleur"}, {"authorId": "2086669254", "name": "Jean-Luc Manguin"}, {"authorId": "2479369", "name": "N.
