To study theoretical properties of the algorithm, the assumption of conditional homoscedasticity is often supposed in existing studies. However, this assumption is restrictive and often unrealistic in practice. Therefore, in this paper, we consider the allometric extension model, that is, the directions of the first eigenvectors of two covariance matrices and the direction of the difference of two mean vectors coincide, and we provide a non-asymptotic bound of the error probability of the spectral clustering algorithm for the allometric extension model. As a byproduct of the result, we obtain the consistency of the clustering method in high-dimensional settings.", "venue": "", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Mathematics"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2023-09-12", "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2239097116", "name": "Kohei Kawamoto"}, {"authorId": "2239105438", "name": "Yuichi Goto"}, {"authorId": "2239105081", "name": "Koji Tsukuda"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "b26accb39a645acb94d674e4d8ae6b5975cf6420", "title": "Estimators for multivariate allometric regression model"}]}
