Our hypothesis is that human behavior depends both on a static profile and a dynamic context. So, we verify our hypothesis by performing repeated experiments. In our experiments, one author acted as the agent and collected many responses from members in an organization. As a result, an effective messaging style can be found by understanding their profile. Next, we categorize their profiles into stubborn one and flexible one. A small amount of data could not make any impact on the members with the stubborn profile, but made an impact on those with the flexible profile, depending on their context. So, we confirm that the agent should understand the profile and context of the object persons, and transform the data to effectively convey the client\u2019s intention. Finally, we address a design method of human profiling agent.
