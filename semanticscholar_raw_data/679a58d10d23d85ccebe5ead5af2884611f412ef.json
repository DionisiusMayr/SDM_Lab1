This article provides a systematic review of the literature on predictive maintenance applications of chilled water systems that are in line with Industry 4.0/Quality 4.0. The review is based on answering two research questions about understanding the mechanism of identifying the system\u2019s faults during its operation and exploring the methods that were used to predict these faults. The research gaps are explained in this article and are related to three parts, which are faults description and handling, data collection and frequency, and the coverage of the proposed maintenance programs. This article suggests performing a mixed method study to try to fill in the aforementioned gaps.", "venue": "Buildings", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-08-13", "journal": {"name": "Buildings"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2045003250", "name": "Malek Almobarek"}, {"authorId": "2073577", "name": "K.
