Compare with conventionally used cyclic redundancy check (CRC) method, the proposed method may usually achieve a 99% reduction of bandwidth with the expense of losing only a little detection capacity. We also provide an analysis of performance and a suggestion of auxiliary matrix used in the proposed framework. Besides, a theoretical upper bound of CRC method\u2019s detection capacity is given.", "venue": "International Symposium on Information Theory", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-06-26", "journal": {"name": "2022 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)", "pages": "2397-2402"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2180427163", "name": "Zhiquan Tan"}, {"authorId": "1799073", "name": "Sian-Jheng Lin"}, {"authorId": "3308712", "name": "Y.
