Establishing this research in the dynamic capability view (DCV) and corporate culture and dependent on an sample of 310 Indian production industries, the purpose of this paper is to experimentally study the impacts of BDA on corporate social performance (CSP) and corporate green performance (CGP) using variance-based structural equation modeling (for example, PLS).\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nA questionnaire was used to accumulate data sets to examine research hypothesis. The authors pre-examined the survey with six scholastics and six directors from production firms in India. With the help of their sources of data, the authors have adjusted their wordings to improve the transparency and guarantee that length of the survey is accurate. Finally, the questionnaire was prepared for definite data collection.\n\n\nFindings\nThe authors conclude that BDA has noteworthy effect on CSP/CGP. Notwithstanding, the authors did not find proof for directing role of flexible direction and control direction in the connections among BDA and CSP/CGP. This research offers a more nuanced comprehension of the performance ramifications of BDA, and in this way, it is tending to the critical inquiries of how and when BDA can improve in supply chains.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThis investigation makes helpful commitments to the BDA research and its effect on CSP/CGP. To the authors\u2019 best of information, this is the first hypothesis-focused approach to clarify the effect of BDA on ecological and social supportability. Second, this investigation likewise gives empirical proof that BDA impact on CSP/CGP and is free of flexible or control direction of the industry.\n", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2020-10-01", "journal": {"name": "Journal of Modelling in Management", "volume": ""}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2064447207", "name": "B.
