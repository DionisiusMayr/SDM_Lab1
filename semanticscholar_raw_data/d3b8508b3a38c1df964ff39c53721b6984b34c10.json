Artificial Intelligence paves the way for recommending higher education courses. In this article, a framework is proposed that uses different features like learners\u2019 interest, their past performance and mainly their family talent history. This framework emphasizes the Intelligence Robotic Course Recommendation System. The system is very helpful for the learner who don\u2019t have that much of an explorer of the current trends happening in the world. When the learners similarity knowledge interest is known with respect to real-world needs, the perfect higher education is suggested for them. This paper shows that the framework gives better results when using with artificial intelligence algorithms.", "venue": "2023 International Conference on Computer, Electronics & Electrical Engineering & their Applications (IC2E3)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-06-08", "journal": {"name": "2023 International Conference on Computer, Electronics & Electrical Engineering & their Applications (IC2E3)", "pages": "1-6"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2243994848", "name": "Vinay M"}, {"authorId": "2243991956", "name": "Jayapriya J"}], "citations": []}
