In order to use and reuse these data properly, the presence of accountability information is essential. Accountability requires specific and accurate information about people's responsibilities and actions. In this article, we define KGAcc, a framework dedicated to the assessment of RDF graphs accountability. It consists of accountability requirements and a measure of accountability for KGs. Then, we evaluate KGs from the LOD cloud and describe the results obtained. Finally, we compare our approach with data quality and FAIR assessment frameworks to highlight the differences.", "venue": "2023 IEEE International Conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology (WI-IAT)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-09-28", "journal": {"name": "2023 IEEE International Conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology (WI-IAT)", "pages": "213-220"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2146697855", "name": "Jennie Andersen"}, {"authorId": "1755353", "name": "Sylvie Cazalens"}, {"authorId": "145356248", "name": "Philippe Lamarre"}, {"authorId": "2248198162", "name": "Pierre Maillot"}], "citations": []}
