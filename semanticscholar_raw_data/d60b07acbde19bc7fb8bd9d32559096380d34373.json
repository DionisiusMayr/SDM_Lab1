Weather, vessel type, and the nature and amount of the goods are all external elements that might impact container handling times, which are directly related to overall port stay time. In this scope, container terminal operations could be optimised with the help of historical data which provides access to classification and prediction of the cargo handling operations. In this study, the real-time data of a container terminal operation is analysed with different machine learning techniques along with the Fuzzy C-Means clustering method. The results show that Fuzzy C-Means clustering has a positive impact on the explanatory power of models in container terminal operations. The research revealed that an increase in wind speed influences cargo handling time for mobile cranes.", "venue": "International Journal of Business Analytics", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-01-01", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Business Analytics"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "151242341", "name": "\u00dcst\u00fcn Atak"}, {"authorId": "1781709102", "name": "Tolga Kaya"}, {"authorId": "15759502", "name": "Yasin Arslano\u011flu"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "5b9a71aa8b50d4051a62a2f6f12ae6902048d6ec", "title": "Handling uncertainty in the quay crane scheduling problem: a unified distributionally robust decision model"}]}
