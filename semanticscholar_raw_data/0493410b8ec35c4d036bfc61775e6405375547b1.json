Despite decades of research on temporal databases, which cul-minated in the addition of temporal data operations into the SQL:2011 standard, temporal data query and manipulation operations are unavailable in most mainstream database management systems, leaving developers with the unenvi-able task of implementing such functionality from scratch. In this paper, we extend language-integrated query to support writing temporal queries and updates in a uniform host language, with the language performing the required rewriting to emulate temporal capabilities automatically on any standard relational database. We introduce two core languages, \ud835\udf06 TLINQ and \ud835\udf06 VLINQ , for manipulating transaction time and valid time data respectively, and formalise existing implementation strategies by giving provably correct semantics-preserving translations into a non-temporal core language, \ud835\udf06 LINQ . We show how existing work on query normalisation supports a surprisingly simple implementation strategy for sequenced joins . We implement our approach in the Links programming language, and describe a non-trivial case study based on curating COVID-19 statistics.", "venue": "", "year": null, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [], "citations": []}
