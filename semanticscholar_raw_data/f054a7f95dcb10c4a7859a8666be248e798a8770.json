Student-teacher learning management programs are implemented as an intermediary. This paradigm is changed by intelligent agents reproducing the smart procedures of the instructor and the students. The technologies of Artificial Intelligence are based upon the replication of human intelligence concepts. This study presents an overview of the LMS in which Artificial Intelligent techniques were used. In addition, we highlight other the wide range of variety Models in Learning Management Systems related to AI were studied to solve some LMS issues and benefit students, faculty members, and administrators.", "venue": "International Journal of Computer Applications", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2020-08-17", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Computer Applications"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "52050585", "name": "Nouf S.
