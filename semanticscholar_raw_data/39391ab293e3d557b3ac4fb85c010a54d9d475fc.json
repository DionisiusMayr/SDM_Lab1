In recent years, researchers have achieved good results in research on a small scale and single environment characteristics of this issue. However, for the whole earthquake-affected area with large scale and complex environments, the correct rate of extracting co-seismic landslides remains low, and there is no ideal method to solve this problem. In this paper, Planet Satellite images with a spatial resolution of 3 m are used to train a seismic landslide recognition model based on the deep learning method to carry out rapid and automatic extraction of landslides triggered by the 2018 Iburi earthquake, Japan. The study area is about 671.87 km2, of which 60% is used to train the model, and the remaining 40% is used to verify the accuracy of the model. The results show that most of the co-seismic landslides can be identified by this method. In this experiment, the verification precision of the model is 0.7965 and the F1 score is 0.8288. This method can intelligently identify and map landslides triggered by earthquakes from Planet images. It has strong practicability and high accuracy. It can provide assistance for earthquake emergency rescue and rapid disaster assessment.", "venue": "Remote Sensing", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Geology"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-12-06", "journal": {"name": "Remote.
