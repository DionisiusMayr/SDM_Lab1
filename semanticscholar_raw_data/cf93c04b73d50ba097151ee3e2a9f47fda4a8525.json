One potential solution for the long sequence problem is to utilize distributed clusters to parallelize the computation of attention modules across multiple devices (e.g., GPUs). However, adopting a distributed approach inevitably introduces extra memory overheads to store local attention results and incurs additional communication costs to aggregate local results into global ones. In this paper, we propose a distributed attention framework named ``BurstAttention'' to optimize memory access and communication operations at both the global cluster and local device levels. In our experiments, we compare BurstAttention with other competitive distributed attention solutions for long sequence processing. The experimental results under different length settings demonstrate that BurstAttention offers significant advantages for processing long sequences compared with these competitive baselines, reducing 40% communication overheads and achieving 2 X speedup during training 32K sequence length on 8 X A100.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-03-14", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2403.09347"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2291137879", "name": "Sun Ao"}, {"authorId": "2150606888", "name": "Weilin Zhao"}, {"authorId": "2284728053", "name": "Xu Han"}, {"authorId": "2257052321", "name": "Cheng Yang"}, {"authorId": "2141313179", "name": "Zhiyuan Liu"}, {"authorId": "2291444003", "name": "Chuan Shi"}, {"authorId": "2273551430", "name": "Maosong Sun"}, {"authorId": "2291391165", "name": "Shengnan Wang"}, {"authorId": "2291138338", "name": "Teng Su"}], "citations": []}
