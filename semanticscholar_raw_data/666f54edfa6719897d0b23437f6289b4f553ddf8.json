These advances rely the notion of Pre-Mappability (PreM ) of constraints that, along with the seminaivefixpoint operational semantics, guarantees formal non-monotonic semantics for recursive programs with min and max constraints. In this extended abstract, we introduce basic templates to simplify and automate task of proving PreM. 2012 ACM Subject Classification Information systems \u2192 Query languages", "venue": "International Conference on Logic Programming", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"pages": "9:1-9:3"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1712630", "name": "C.
