In this work, we developed a multi-language robot interface helping to evaluate the mental health of seniors by interacting through questions. Through the voice interface, the specialist can propose questions, as well as receive users\u2019 answers, in text form. The robot can automatically interact with the user using the appropriate language. It can process the answers and under the guidance of a specialist, questions and answers can be oriented towards the desired therapy direction. The prototype was implemented on an embedded device meant for edge computing, thus it was able to filter environmental noise and can be placed anywhere at home. The proposed platform allows the integration of well-known open source and commercial data flow processing frameworks. The experience is now available for specialists to create queries and answers through a Web-based interface.", "venue": "Electronics", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2020-02-29", "journal": {"name": "Electronics"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1412562934", "name": "C.
