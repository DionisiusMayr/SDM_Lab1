Unfortunately, existing system frameworks all focus on the execution of a single walker task in serial. We propose CoWalker, a high-throughput GPU random walk framework tailored for concurrent random walk tasks. It introduces a multi-level concurrent execution model to allow concurrent random walk tasks to efficiently share GPU resources with low overhead. Our system prototype confirms that the proposed system could outperform (up to 54%) the state-of-the-art in a wide spectral of scenarios.", "venue": "ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles & Practice of Parallel Programming", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-02-25", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 28th ACM SIGPLAN Annual Symposium on Principles and Practice of Parallel Programming"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2189499186", "name": "Cheng Xu"}, {"authorId": "82511570", "name": "Chao Li"}, {"authorId": "1914624198", "name": "Pengyu Wang"}, {"authorId": "2087625687", "name": "Xiaofeng Hou"}, {"authorId": "2152447086", "name": "Jing Wang"}, {"authorId": "1955271", "name": "Shixuan Sun"}, {"authorId": "2151671216", "name": "Minyi Guo"}, {"authorId": "2197496491", "name": "Hanqing Wu"}, {"authorId": "2209161049", "name": "Dongbai Chen"}, {"authorId": "2029519367", "name": "Xiang-Yi Liu"}], "citations": []}
