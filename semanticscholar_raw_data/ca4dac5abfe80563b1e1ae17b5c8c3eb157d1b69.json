And (2) it should describe the internal parallel structure of the stream to support deterministic stream processing on parallel and distributed systems. To these ends, we introduce stream types, with operators capturing sequential composition, parallel composition, and iteration, plus a core calculus lambda-ST of transformers over typed streams which naturally supports a number of common streaming idioms, including punctuation, windowing, and parallel partitioning, as first-class constructions. lambda-ST exploits a Curry-Howard-like correspondence with an ordered variant of the logic of Bunched Implication to program with streams compositionally and uses Brzozowski-style derivatives to enable an incremental, prefix-based operational semantics. To illustrate the programming style supported by the rich types of lambda-ST, we present a number of examples written in delta, a prototype high-level language design based on lambda-ST.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-07-18", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2307.09553"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2057364933", "name": "Joseph W.
