Such incompleteness, also known as the open-world assumption, prevents logical queries from being answered through the query-answering paradigms for relational databases. In this paper, we discuss how learning-based models bridge incomplete relational data and logical queries from the perspective of rigorous formal logic. Existing works are structured as a three-party game among knowledge graphs, logical queries", "venue": "IEEE Data Engineering Bulletin", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "IEEE Data Eng.
