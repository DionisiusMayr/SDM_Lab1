During validation, it should be proved that, the system meets its timing constraints. Therefore, worst-case execution time (WCET) analysis is performed. Currently, several WCET analysis tools are being developed. Researchers who develop new WCET analysis tools, need benchmarks to evaluate and compare their tools with alternatives. These benchmarks are called WCET benchmarks. In this paper a new WCET benchmark suite named ABench2020 is introduced. Its main focus is to provide benchmark programs in Ada programming language for WCET research. Therefore, ABench2020 includes several benchmark programs which were written in Ada programming language. The benchmark programs implement different program structures and properties to help researchers test their systems from different aspects. ABench2020 was published as open source. It is freely available over the Internet.", "venue": "Academic Perspective Procedia", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2020-10-25", "journal": {"name": "Academic Perspective Procedia"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2099662074", "name": "\u00d6zge G\u00f6k\u00e7e"}, {"authorId": "49978432", "name": "V.
