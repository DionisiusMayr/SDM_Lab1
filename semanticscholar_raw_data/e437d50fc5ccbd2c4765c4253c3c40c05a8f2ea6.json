However, prior disaggregation systems are designed for native applications; in addition, all of them require applications to possess excellent locality to be efficiently executed. In contrast, programs written in managed languages are subject to periodic garbage collection (GC), which is a typical graph workload with poor locality. Although most datacenter applications are written in managed languages, current systems are far from delivering acceptable performance for these applications. This paper presents Semeru, a distributed JVM that can dramatically improve the performance of managed cloud applications in a memory-disaggregated environment. Its design possesses three major innovations: (1) a universal Java heap, which provides a unified abstraction of virtual memory across CPU and memory servers and allows any legacy program to run without modifications; (2) a distributed GC, which offloads object tracing to memory servers so that tracing is performed closer to data; and (3) a swap system in the OS kernel that works with the runtime to swap page data efficiently. An evaluation of Semeru on a set of widely-deployed systems shows very promising results.", "venue": "USENIX Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"pages": "261-280"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2121328398", "name": "Chenxi Wang"}, {"authorId": "2037689378", "name": "Haoran Ma"}, {"authorId": "150301258", "name": "Siyi Liu"}, {"authorId": "2136538102", "name": "Yuanqi Li"}, {"authorId": "23221554", "name": "Zhenyuan Ruan"}, {"authorId": "2055541087", "name": "Khanh Nguyen"}, {"authorId": "2864858", "name": "Michael D.
