These open storage systemswith richmanagement features promise to simplify management of large datasets, accelerate SQL workloads, and offer fast, direct file access for other workloads, such as machine learning. However, the research community has not explored the tradeoffs in designing lakehouse systems in detail. In this paper, we analyze the designs of the three most popular lakehouse storage systems\u2014Delta Lake, Hudi and Iceberg\u2014and compare their performance and features among varying axes based on these designs. We also release a simple benchmark, LHBench, that researchers can use to compare other designs.
