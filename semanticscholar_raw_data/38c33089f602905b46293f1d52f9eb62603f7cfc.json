Society 5.0 represents an evolution from the industrial focus of Industry 4.0, aiming for a harmonious balance between technological progress and human-centric values, consistent with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Our methodology involves a detailed literature review, focusing on identifying and evaluating the roles of AI, IoT, and other emerging technologies in enhancing resource efficiency, particularly in the water and energy sectors, to minimize environmental impact. This approach allows us to present a comprehensive overview of current technological advancements and their potential applications in Society 5.0. Our study\u2019s added value lies in its synthesis of diverse technological strategies, emphasizing the synergy between circular economy practices and sustainable economic development. We highlight the necessity for resilience and adaptability to ecological challenges and advocate for a collaborative, data-informed decision-making framework. Our findings portray Society 5.0 as a holistic model for addressing contemporary global challenges in resource management and conservation, projecting a future where technology aligns with sustainable, equitable, and human-centered development.", "venue": "Resources", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2024-01-24", "journal": {"name": "Resources"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1412956976", "name": "C\u00e9sar Ram\u00edrez-M\u00e1rquez"}, {"authorId": "2281196840", "name": "Thelma Posadas-Paredes"}, {"authorId": "2185373032", "name": "Alma Yunuen Raya-Tapia"}, {"authorId": "1400272896", "name": "J.
