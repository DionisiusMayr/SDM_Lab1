It allows trading off materialization effort vs. network utilization, which is essential to tailoring the query evaluation to the quantity and power of available compute resources. This goes far beyond the capabilities of more rigid schemes like the HyperCube technique or the BiStream approach that is limited to simple binary plans only. Around MultiStream, we have implemented CLASH, a high-level abstraction on top of Apache Storm, allowing users to phrase declarative queries, which are then optimized and translated into executable Storm topologies. Experiments on Amazon\u2019s EC2, using TPC-H and an additional synthetic benchmark, underpin the versatility of the operator model and CLASH\u2019S ability to outperform state-of-the-art competitors.", "venue": "2019 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2019-12-01", "journal": {"name": "2019 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "pages": "449-456"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "147453237", "name": "Manuel Dossinger"}, {"authorId": "48786878", "name": "S.
