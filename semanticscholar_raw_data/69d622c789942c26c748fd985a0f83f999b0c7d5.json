In addition, the librarians\u2019 perceptions of the proposed approach were also investigated.\n\n\nFindings\nThe findings indicated that readers often borrowed books in the bibliographical classifications of Home economics; Medical sciences; Psychology; Commerce: administration and management; and Education in the self-service library stations. Based on the bibliomining results, 23 reader borrowing patterns as well as potential books favoured by readers were uncovered. In addition, the challenges of bibliomining and data mining applied to library operations are reported.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nAmong the studies on the application of self-service technologies in libraries, most examined the integration of the self-service system and investigated users\u2019 opinions. The present study used borrowing records and collection records in self-service library stations to conduct bibliomining and to explore reader borrowing preferences and behaviours as references for collection development and book recommendation services.\n", "venue": "Electronic library", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-12-09", "journal": {"name": "Electron.
