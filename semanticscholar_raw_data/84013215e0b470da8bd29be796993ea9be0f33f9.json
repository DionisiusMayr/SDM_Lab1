Due to this damage, some irregular variations in temperature, rainfalls, and sea level are being experienced. Such variations in temperature, rainfall patterns, or sea level rise are irrelevant. Variations in rainfall intensity will significantly impact water level and water quality. Rising sea levels will impact land usage and development in the coastal area. Big climate data analytics implementations havefocused on climate change because it is a new issue, and extensive study has been done on various subjects. Rainfall prediction is the most crucial aspect of Big data techniques in climate change. Since most individuals worldwide depend on agriculture, this may benefit farmers and the general populace. The study illustrates numerous methods by which big data has aided in creating predictions regarding the problem of climate change. It can assist farmers in making wise judgments on crop yield. Studying the timing of floods or droughts simultaneously may be possible.", "venue": "2023 International Conference on Innovative Data Communication Technologies and Application (ICIDCA)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-03-14", "journal": {"name": "2023 International Conference on Innovative Data Communication Technologies and Application (ICIDCA)", "pages": "481-488"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2215021291", "name": "Adish Chandra Shrivastava"}, {"authorId": "153355195", "name": "Mohd.
