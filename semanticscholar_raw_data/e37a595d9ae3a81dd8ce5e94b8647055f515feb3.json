Normally, network traffic usually needs to pass through several VNFs in a particular order. This phenomenon is known as Service Function Chaining (SFC). How to place SFCs with minimal resource is still an open problem. Most of the existing work thinks it's difficult to find the placement solution for all SFCs as a whole, they, instead, consider each demand sequentially, and deploy SFCs one by one. But such serial placement lacks consideration of the interrelations among demands and unable to minimize resource. In this paper, we innovatively propose a parallel deployment scheme based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). It satisfies demands with minimum resource. We design an overall SFC placement scheme for all demands, and deploy all SFCs simultaneously. We evaluate the proposed algorithms using extensive simulations and prototype experiments. The result demonstrates that our parallel deployment approach minimized resource costs compared with other schemes.", "venue": "International Conference on Innovative Computing and Cloud Computing", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2019-12-01", "journal": {"name": "2019 IEEE 5th International Conference on Computer and Communications (ICCC)", "pages": "2123-2128"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2059231522", "name": "Hua Chai"}, {"authorId": "51203632", "name": "Jiao Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2108726564", "name": "Zenan Wang"}, {"authorId": "2117868409", "name": "Jiaming Shi"}, {"authorId": "102628601", "name": "Tao Huang"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "18e100550886ccde8ba0f45c8d513246d7ffaca5", "title": "SPIDER: An availability\u2010aware framework for the service function chain placement in distributed scenarios"}, {"paperId": "588d292a9301cddb5b61453c91488ad3f03c8abc", "title": "A Reinforcement Learning Approach for Virtual Network Function Chaining and Sharing in Softwarized Networks"}, {"paperId": "bc28adf8b148b94bc973a6db157e11031f5946b5", "title": "Resource consumption and security-aware multi-tenant service function chain deployment based on hypergraph matching"}, {"paperId": "05f9ed796ba5c42da058a4931ea6cd2edadb4cfa", "title": "Intent-based zero-touch service chaining layer for software-defined edge cloud networks"}, {"paperId": "6c28065851f020535030663ac839c1e3b5dde391", "title": "Network Function Virtualization and Service Function Chaining Frameworks: A Comprehensive Review of Requirements, Objectives, Implementations, and Open Research Challenges"}, {"paperId": "ec0e3759127d1b92bced9c456d9fa8618fa4bf22", "title": "Self\u2010Managed 5G Networks\n 1"}, {"paperId": "5ba645685678a949e5c6224a5cf596a91e174d52", "title": "A genetic algorithm approach for service function chain placement in 5G and beyond, virtualized edge networks"}, {"paperId": "a0ec3b75cf17b8e40c48201bcb4fbbe96396bb04", "title": "CHANGE: Delay-Aware Service Function Chain Orchestration at the Edge"}, {"paperId": "79f8f62836493157a553d058343c591b5880a25f", "title": "Availability-aware and energy-aware dynamic SFC placement using reinforcement learning"}, {"paperId": "ce1b7b5ae7d1623ca7488ea1232f0e10babdd9c3", "title": "The Greatest Teacher, Failure is: Using Reinforcement Learning for SFC Placement Based on Availability and Energy Consumption"}, {"paperId": "d7619c3cf8e057752ee422a1c8f75aecc1cadeb0", "title": "COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK AND SERVICE MANAGEMENT IN THE ERA OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND MACHINE LEARNING"}]}
