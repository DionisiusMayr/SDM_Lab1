Statistics reveal that every year, about 1.6 million deaths are recorded which can be directly attributed to diabetes. The graph suggests that number of cases as well as the prevalence of diabetes have been steadily incrementing over the past few decades. Through this new implementation of the Bayesian Classifier, raw medical data is analyzed and the risk of diabetes diagnosis based on each patient\u2019s medical information can be calculated. The raw data is converted into class labels and the likelihood of a positive potential diabetes case is derived, as a probability (\u22641). This can not only be used by healthcare professionals but also by common users, and can be useful in detecting the risk and preventing it in time without taking any medical tests. This classifier uses very basic information that would be known to each patient or can easily be obtained.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "71359837", "name": "A.
