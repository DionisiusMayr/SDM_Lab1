The web contains a large amount of information in the form of ratings, reviews, feedback on items and other unstructured data. These details are extracted to get meaningful information of users. Collaborative filtering and content-based filtering are two common approaches being used to make recommendations. The paper aims to introduce a hybrid recommendation technique for Big Data Systems. The approach combines collaborative and content-based filtering techniques to recommend items that a user would most likely prefer. It additionally uses items ranking and classification technique for recommending the items. Moreover, social media opinion mining is added as a top-up to derive user sentiments from user\u2019s posts and become knowledgeable about users\u2019 tastes hidden within social media. A prototype has been implemented and evaluated based on the recommendation techniques.", "venue": "2018 International Conference on Intelligent and Innovative Computing Applications (ICONIC)", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2018-12-01", "journal": {"name": "2018 International Conference on Intelligent and Innovative Computing Applications (ICONIC)", "pages": "1-7"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "67104137", "name": "Chitra Nundlall"}, {"authorId": "66493460", "name": "Gopal Sohun"}, {"authorId": "2281390", "name": "S.
