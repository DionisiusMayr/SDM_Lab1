Nonetheless, most of the existing works focused on the cost optimization of the entire process, while the cost of individual participants cannot be considered. In this paper, we explore a min-max cost-optimal problem to guarantee the convergence rate of federated learning in terms of cost in wireless edge networks. In particular, we minimize the cost of the worst-case participant subject to the delay, local CPU-cycle frequency, power allocation, local accuracy, and subcarrier assignment constraints. Considering that the formulated problem is a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, we decompose it into several sub-problems to derive its solutions, in which the subcarrier assignment and power allocation are obtained by utilizing the Lagrangian dual decomposition method, the CPU-cycle frequency is obtained by a heuristic algorithm, and the local accuracy is obtained by an iteration algorithm. Simulation results show the convergence of the proposed algorithm and reveal that the proposed scheme can accomplish a tradeoff between the cost and fairness by comparing the proposed scheme with the existing schemes.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate":
