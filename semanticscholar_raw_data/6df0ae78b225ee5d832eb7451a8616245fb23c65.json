A few slow tasks called stragglers can potentially adversely affect job execution times. Equally, inadequate slotting of data analytics applications could result in inappropriate resource deployment, ultimately damaging system performance. Against this backdrop, one effective way of tackling stragglers is by making extra attempts (or clones)<xref ref-type=\"fn\" rid=\"fn1\"><sup>1</sup></xref> for every single straggler after the submission of a job. This paper proposes Shed<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\pmb {+}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, which is an optimization framework utilizing dynamic speculation that aims to maximize the jobs\u2019 PoCD (Probability of Completion before Deadline) by making full use of available resources. Notably, our work encompasses a new online scheduler that dynamically recomputes and reallocates resources during the course of a job\u2019s execution. According to our findings, Shed<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\pmb {+}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> successfully leverages cloud resources and maximizes the percentage of jobs meeting their deadlines.
