However, the existing vulnerability exploitability prediction research directly aggregates all vulnerability data without considering the security of vulnerability information, which leads to some problems such as data leakage and data island. In this paper, we propose a method for vulnerability exploitability prediction based on federated learning, which aims to achieve vulnerability exploitability prediction while protecting the security of vendor vulnerability data. Specifically, we first construct a vulnerability exploitability prediction model in a federated learning environment and classify the collected vulnerability data by vendors. Second, we evaluate multiple vulnerability exploitability prediction models and improve existing models. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed model achieves good results in the federated learning environment.", "venue": "2022 5th International Conference on Hot Information-Centric Networking (HotICN)", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-11-24", "journal": {"name": "2022 5th International Conference on Hot Information-Centric Networking (HotICN)", "pages": "83-89"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2142364048", "name": "Wangyuan Jing"}, {"authorId": "2118564", "name": "Lingbo Wei"}, {"authorId": "2152883061", "name": "Hao Jin"}, {"authorId": "2145179546", "name": "Chi Zhang"}, {"authorId": "33164128", "name": "Wenxiang Dong"}, {"authorId": "2154899584", "name": "Yangyang Li"}], "citations": []}
