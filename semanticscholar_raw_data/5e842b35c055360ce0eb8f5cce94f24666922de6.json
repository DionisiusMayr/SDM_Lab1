Student Evaluation and classification is very much important for improving the result percentage. Hence, Educational Data Mining based models for analyzing the academic performances have become an interesting research domain in current scenario. With that note, this paper develops a model called Multi-Tier Student Performance Evaluation Model ( MTSPEM ) using single and ensemble classifiers. The student data from higher educational institutions are obtained and evaluated in this modelbasedonsignificantfactorsthatimpactsgreatermannerinstudent\u2019sperformancesandresults.Further,datapreprocessing iscarriedoutforremovingtheduplicateandredundantdata,thereby,enhancingtheresultsaccuracy.Themulti-tiermodel containstwophasesofclassifications,namely,primaryclassificationandsecondaryclassification.TheFirst-TierclassificationphaseusesNaiveBayesClassification,whereasthesecond-tierclassificationcomprisestheEnsembleclassifierssuchasBoosting, StackingandRandomForest(RF).Theperformanceanalysisoftheproposedworkisestablishedforcalculatingtheclassification accuracyandcomparativeevaluationsarealsoperformedforevidencingtheefficiencyoftheproposedmodel", "venue": "International Journal of Computational Intelligence Systems", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-06-01", "journal": {"name": "Int.
