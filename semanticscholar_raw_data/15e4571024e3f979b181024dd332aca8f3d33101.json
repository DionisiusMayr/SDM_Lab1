During the training of I\u2010ELMs, the hidden neurons are presented one by one, and the weights are based solely on simple direct summations, which can be most efficiently mapped on parallel environments. Existing incremental versions of ELMs are the I\u2010ELM, enhanced incremental ELM (EI\u2010ELM), and convex incremental ELM (CI\u2010ELM). We study the enhanced and convex incremental ELM (ECI\u2010ELM) algorithm, which is a combination of the last 2 versions. The main findings are that ECI\u2010ELM is fast, accurate, and fully scalable when it operates in a parallel system of distributed memory workstations. Experimental simulations on several benchmark data sets demonstrate that the ECI\u2010ELM is the most accurate among the existing I\u2010ELM, EI\u2010ELM, and CI\u2010ELM algorithms. We also analyze the convergence as a function of the hidden neurons and demonstrate that ECI\u2010ELM has the lowest error rate curve and converges much faster than the other algorithms in all of the data sets. The parallel simulations also reveal that the data parallel training of the ECI\u2010ELM can guarantee simplicity and straightforward mappings and can deliver speedups and scale\u2010ups very close to linear.", "venue": "International Conference on Climate Informatics", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2018-08-01", "journal": {"name": "Computational Intelligence", "pages": "875 - 894", "volume": "34"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1909949", "name": "Y.
