We formalize a probabilistic database model with respect to which all queries are done. This allows us to leverage the rich literature of theory and algorithms from probabilistic databases for solving problems. While this formalization can be used with any relational embedding model, the lack of a well-defined joint probability distribution causes simple query problems to become provably hard. With this in mind, we introduce \\TO, a relational embedding model designed to be a tractable probabilistic database, by exploiting typical embedding assumptions within the probabilistic framework. Using a principled, efficient inference algorithm that can be derived from its definition, we empirically demonstrate that \\TOs is an effective and general model for these querying tasks.", "venue": "Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2020-02-24", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2002.10029"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "47009206", "name": "Tal Friedman"}, {"authorId": "1749506", "name": "Guy Van den Broeck"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "30a43bb0e878985ce27caf9c7fc3e921056d3741", "title": "Logic Diffusion for Knowledge Graph Reasoning"}, {"paperId": "4145d0fd4e8c8ed87786c34ee8d363887994607b", "title": "How to Turn Your Knowledge Graph Embeddings into Generative Models via Probabilistic Circuits"}, {"paperId": "c979721d68ac59aa61cb7d95b2c8aa3a31a8bd2f", "title": "Probabilistic Reasoning at Scale: Trigger Graphs to the Rescue"}, {"paperId": "033275ccc2c7c5c38592ae893da0b5923cf90717", "title": "Neural Graph Reasoning: Complex Logical Query Answering Meets Graph Databases"}, {"paperId": "5f5f8cb1a646a0612738784f6774fa179adcdf65", "title": "An epistemic approach to model uncertainty in data-graphs"}, {"paperId": "ee6da7e7c6785f9aa7c610884ae3294f39958d1a", "title": "Fuzzy Logic based Logical Query Answering on Knowledge Graph"}, {"paperId": "62ba6604ed24c808062f89f8f41eda3b6a566917", "title": "Complex Query Answering with Neural Link Predictors"}, {"paperId": "bccf951307e3c05a408456079ba94e419a885658", "title": "Probabilistic Databases for All"}, {"paperId": "018acec0ec728f5769d937df7b5f21f16db31190", "title": "Regex Queries over Incomplete Knowledge Bases"}, {"paperId": "cd1dffa09c8163b3544a3f19d061ec76749a1e72", "title": "Answering Complex Queries in Knowledge Graphs with Bidirectional Sequence Encoders"}, {"paperId": "c11b977ea1e35d889ae1b29a5c6bb3735c1732da", "title": "Lifted Division for Lifted Hugin Belief Propagation"}, {"paperId": "3016cf9cb28ea0c3017c8898d9f3fbc73ff1993c", "title": "Ensemble-Based Fact Classification with Knowledge Graph Embeddings"}, {"paperId": "26894edf44897f8ed127ef57051be637c1cb43c3", "title": "Your Knowledge Graph Embeddings are Secretly Circuits and You Should Treat Them as Such"}, {"paperId": "2206285567c37ad8a1b6839b042238fd831e5571", "title": "Interventions and Counterfactuals in Tractable Probabilistic Models"}, {"paperId": "b66e61bc97884fb570426fe327880e09cbd2e7ac", "title": "Extending Real Logic with Aggregate Functions"}, {"paperId": "160c91afd32ae303fbbfd7db8f3a400b4615325d", "title": "Interventions and Counterfactuals in Tractable Probabilistic Models"}, {"paperId": "c6979922e8f61a13992d2344ae83e1829eeb5716", "title": "A Neural-symbolic Approach for Ontology-mediated Query Answering"}, {"paperId": "9075c2ba7db572cd156366798abeea8b4e532418", "title": "Investigating Matureness of Probabilistic Graphical Models for Dry-Bulk Shipping"}, {"paperId": "f24c0ae9eb0194e88558d34ea0938b7d62fa2655", "title": "Towards Utilizing Knowledge Graph Embedding Models for Conceptual Clustering"}]}
