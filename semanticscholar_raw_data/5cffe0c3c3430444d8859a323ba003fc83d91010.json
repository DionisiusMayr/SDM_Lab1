These RICs leverage AI/ML models for intelligent decisions, interacting with RAN components \u2014 centralized units (CUs), distributed units (DUs), and radio units (RUs). Choosing the appropriate data for AI/ML model training in O-RAN is critical, as training based on the nature of the data, whether homogeneous or heterogeneous, can significantly improve model accuracy and efficient resource utilization. This paper introduces an approach that determines the dataset homogeneity by employing the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (KS Test) and also considers evaluating both real-time and synthetic datasets.", "venue": "International Workshop on Ant Colony Optimization and Swarm Intelligence", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-12-17", "journal": {"name": "2023 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Networks and Telecommunications Systems (ANTS)", "pages": "1-3"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2090272211", "name": "Venkateswarlu Gudepu"}, {"authorId": "2284347250", "name": "Bhargav Chirumamilla"}, {"authorId": "2283541", "name": "Venkatarami Reddy Chintapalli"}, {"authorId": "1681270", "name": "P.
