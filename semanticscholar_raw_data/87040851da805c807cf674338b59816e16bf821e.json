However, most applications are written using bulk-synchronous programming models, which may not be optimal for irregular algorithms that benefit from low-latency, asynchronous communication. This paper proposes constructs for asynchronous multi-GPU programming, and describes their implementation in a thin runtime environment called Groute. Groute also implements common collective operations and distributed work-lists, enabling the development of irregular applications without substantial programming effort. We demonstrate that this approach achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits strong scaling for a suite of irregular applications on 8-GPU and heterogeneous systems, yielding over 7x speedup for some algorithms.", "venue": "ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles & Practice of Parallel Programming", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2017-01-26", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles and Practice of Parallel Programming"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1402921119", "name": "Tal Ben-Nun"}, {"authorId": "119223595", "name": "M.
