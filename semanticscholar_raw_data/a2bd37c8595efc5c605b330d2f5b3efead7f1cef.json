A recently discovered coronavirus causes it. COVID-19 has proven to be challenging to detect and cure at an early stage all over the world. Patients showing symptoms of COVID-19 are resulting in hospitals becoming overcrowded, which is becoming a significant challenge. Deep learning\u2019s contribution to big data medical research has been enormously beneficial, offering new avenues and possibilities for illness diagnosis techniques. To counteract the COVID-19 outbreak, researchers must create a classifier distinguishing between positive and negative corona-positive X-ray pictures. In this paper, the Apache Spark system has been utilized as an extensive data framework and applied a Deep Transfer Learning (DTL) method using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) three architectures \u2014InceptionV3, ResNet50, and VGG19\u2014on COVID-19 chest X-ray images. The three models are evaluated in two classes, COVID-19 and normal X-ray images, with 100 percent accuracy. But in COVID/Normal/pneumonia, detection accuracy was 97 percent for the inceptionV3 model, 98.55 percent for the ResNet50 Model, and 98.55 percent for the VGG19 model, respectively.", "venue": "International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-09-27", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health", "volume": "18"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1476819061", "name": "Mazhar Javed Awan"}, {"authorId": "144769156", "name": "M.
