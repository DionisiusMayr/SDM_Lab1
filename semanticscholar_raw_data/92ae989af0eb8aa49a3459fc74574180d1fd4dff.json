To demonstrate the effectiveness of iStage, it is applied on cyclonic and COVID-19 disasters. The considered disaster data sets are cyclone Fani, cyclone Titli, cyclone Amphan, cyclone Nisarga and COVID-19.\n\n\nFindings\nThe experimental results demonstrate that the iStage outperforms Long Short-Term Memory Network and Convolutional Neural Network models. The proposed approach returns the best possible solution among existing research studies considering different evaluation metrics \u2013 accuracy, precision, recall, f-score, the area under receiver operating characteristic curve and the area under precision-recall curve.\n\n\nOriginality/value\niStage is built using the hybrid architecture of DL models. It is effective in decision-making. The research study helps coordinate disaster activities in a more targeted and timely manner.\n", "venue": "Global Knowledge Memory and Communication", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2023-03-07", "journal": {"name": "Global Knowledge, Memory and Communication"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "66499416", "name": "A.
