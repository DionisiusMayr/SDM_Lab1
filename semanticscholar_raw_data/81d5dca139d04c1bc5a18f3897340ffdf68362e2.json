Among them, the most promising approaches are nanogenerators (NGs) and solar cells (SCs), which independently offer innovative solutions for energy harvesting. This review paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the integration of NGs and SCs, exploring advanced hybrid structures and their diverse applications. First, an overview of the principles and working mechanisms of NGs and SCs is provided for seamless hybrid integrations. Then, various design strategies are discussed, such as piezoelectric and triboelectric NGs with different types of SCs. Finally, a wide range of applications are explored that benefit from the synergistic integration of NGs and SCs, including self\u2010powered electronics, wearable devices, environmental monitoring, and wireless sensor networks. The potential for these hybrid systems is highlighted to address real\u2010world energy needs and contribute to developing sustainable and self\u2010sufficient technologies. In conclusion, this review provides valuable insights into the state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art developments in NGs and SCs integration, shedding light on advanced hybrid structures and their diverse applications.", "venue": "Advanced Energy Materials", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2024-02-26", "journal": {"name": "Advanced Energy Materials"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "94068601", "name": "S.
