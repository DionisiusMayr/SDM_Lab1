Yet, the standard CoT is less effective in problems demanding multiple reasoning steps. This limitation arises from the complex reasoning process in multi-step problems: later stages often depend on the results of several steps earlier, not just the results of the immediately preceding step. Such complexities suggest the reasoning process is naturally represented as a graph. The almost linear and straightforward structure of CoT prompting, however, struggles to capture this complex reasoning graph. To address this challenge, we propose Residual Connection Prompting (RESPROMPT), a new prompting strategy that advances multi-step reasoning in LLMs. Our key idea is to reconstruct the reasoning graph within prompts. We achieve this by integrating necessary connections-links present in the reasoning graph but missing in the linear CoT flow-into the prompts. Termed\"residual connections\", these links are pivotal in morphing the linear CoT structure into a graph representation, effectively capturing the complex reasoning graphs inherent in multi-step problems. We evaluate RESPROMPT on six benchmarks across three diverse domains: math, sequential, and commonsense reasoning. For the open-sourced LLaMA family of models, RESPROMPT yields a significant average reasoning accuracy improvement of 12.5% on LLaMA-65B and 6.8% on LLaMA2-70B. Breakdown analysis further highlights RESPROMPT particularly excels in complex multi-step reasoning: for questions demanding at least five reasoning steps, RESPROMPT outperforms the best CoT based benchmarks by a remarkable average improvement of 21.1% on LLaMA-65B and 14.3% on LLaMA2-70B. Through extensive ablation studies and analyses, we pinpoint how to most effectively build residual connections.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-10-07", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2310.04743"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2249954878", "name": "Song Jiang"}, {"authorId": "2249758145", "name": "Zahra Shakeri"}, {"authorId": "2258300145", "name": "Aaron Chan"}, {"authorId": "2095979", "name": "Maziar Sanjabi"}, {"authorId": "22593971", "name": "Hamed Firooz"}, {"authorId": "2258547654", "name": "Yinglong Xia"}, {"authorId": "36535404", "name": "Bugra Akyildiz"}, {"authorId": "2257321412", "name": "Yizhou Sun"}, {"authorId": "2257099455", "name": "Jinchao Li"}, {"authorId": "2250669429", "name": "Qifan Wang"}, {"authorId": "1709797", "name": "Asli Celikyilmaz"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "15d277a74da8f3783b0207fefaf131a4d4255db5", "title": "DCR: Divide-and-Conquer Reasoning for Multi-choice Question Answering with LLMs"}, {"paperId": "5ee871537ae51e7e2e93d2a70fff5d100649a655", "title": "Mathematical Language Models: A Survey"}, {"paperId": "11a4284e335ba39330b59d9f42ca3272a6166991", "title": "A Survey of Chain of Thought Reasoning: Advances, Frontiers and Future"}]}
