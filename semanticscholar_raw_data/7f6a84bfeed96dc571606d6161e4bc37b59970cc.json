To address this problem, this paper presents an efficient caching component called FGCache (Fine-Grained Cache) for aggregation queries. FGCache is a query-driven caching policy, which aims to maintain the results of aggregation queries in the memory according to the predicates of user queries. The query results are divided into sets with fine-grained querying intervals, which are maintained via an in-memory tree index. We experimentally evaluate the performance of FGCache on various datasets and settings. The results suggest the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposal.", "venue": "International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-12-17", "journal": {"name": "2023 IEEE 29th International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems (ICPADS)", "pages": "100-105"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2203165301", "name": "Can Wang"}, {"authorId": "2241613746", "name": "Peiquan Jin"}, {"authorId": "48001953", "name": "Yongping Luo"}, {"authorId": "2145747474", "name": "Xiaoliang Wang"}, {"authorId": "1735825", "name": "Shouhong Wan"}], "citations": []}
