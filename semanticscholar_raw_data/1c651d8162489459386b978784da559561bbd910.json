These digital footprints of travelers record their time and spatial movements and have become indispensable information resources, vital in applications such as how groups of videographers behave and in future-movement prediction. In this paper, first we propose algorithms to discover homogeneous groups from geo-tagged videos with view directions. Second, we extend the density clustering algorithm to support fields-of-view (FoVs) in the geo-tagged videos and propose an optimization model based on a two-level grid-based index. We show the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed homogeneous-pattern-discovery approach through experimental evaluation on real and synthetic datasets.", "venue": "Italian National Conference on Sensors", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-05-01", "journal": {"name": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "volume": "23"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2216036547", "name": "Xuejing Di"}, {"authorId": "2238711614", "name": "Dong June Lew"}, {"authorId": "50014361", "name": "K.
