In this paper, we propose a way to combine these technologies with discrete-event simulation to improve the use of simulation in decision making in manufacturing. This work will describe how feedback is possible from real world systems directly into a simulation model to guide smart behaviors. Technologies included in the research include feedback from RGBD images of shop floor motion and human interaction within full immersive virtual reality that includes the latest headset technologies.", "venue": "Online World Conference on Soft Computing in Industrial Applications", "year": 2016, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering", "Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2016-12-11", "journal": {"name": "2016 Winter Simulation Conference (WSC)", "pages": "2774-2785"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2344608", "name": "W.
