IIoT must concurrently send various types of data in real time to the cloud for adequately analyzing and processing the data to support the intelligent decision-making needs of IF, which makes massive highly concurrent heterogeneous data streams. The traditional IIoT platform of directly connecting devices to the cloud, which cannot satisfy the high concurrency heterogeneous data stream transmission requirements of IF, result in data loss and high latency. In this article, cloud-edge collaborative stream processing architecture is proposed for efficiently processing high concurrency heterogeneous data streams generated by IIoT in the production process with reliable, confidential, and low latency data transmission from devices to edges and clouds. The real-time display of AGV status and workshop environment through the cloud-edge collaborative stream processing platform prototype system has demonstrated that the latency of data stream transmission processing is millisecond level, fully satisfying the practical application requirements of IF.", "venue": "2023 IEEE Smart World Congress (SWC)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2023-08-28", "journal": {"name": "2023 IEEE Smart World Congress (SWC)", "pages": "711-716"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2289954901", "name": "Ruizhi Lee"}, {"authorId": "98635172", "name": "Ming-yang Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2237884348", "name": "Jihong Yan"}], "citations": []}
