Modern databases use code generation to produce efficient physical plans, but compiling such a plan on each serverless function is costly: every millisecond spent executing on serverless functions multiplies in cost by the number of functions running. Existing serverless data science frameworks therefore generate and compile code on the client, which precludes specializing this code to patterns that may exist in the input data of individual serverless functions. This paper argues for exploring a trade-off space between one-off code generation on the client, and hyperspecialized compilation that generates bespoke code on each serverless function. Our preliminary experiments show that hyperspecialization outperforms client-based compilation on typical heterogeneous datasets in both cost and performance by 2\u20134 \u00d7 .", "venue": "VLDB Workshops", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "51176303", "name": "Leonhard F.
