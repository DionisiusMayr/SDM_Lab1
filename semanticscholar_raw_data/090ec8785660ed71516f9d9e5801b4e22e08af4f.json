Having prior knowledge of which machine learning algorithm will produce the most accurate results is difficult. This study examines the efficacy of a voting-based ensemble classifier to identify invasive Phragmites australis from three-band (red, green, blue; RGB) and five-band (red, green, blue, red edge, near-infrared; multispectral; MS) UAS imagery acquired over multiple Minnesota wetlands. A Random Forest, histogram-based gradient-boosting classification tree, and two artificial neural networks were used within the voting-based ensemble classifier. Classifications from the RGB and multispectral imagery were compared across validation sites both with and without post-processing from an object-based image analysis (OBIA) workflow (post-machine learning OBIA rule set; post-ML OBIA rule set). Results from this study suggest that a voting-based ensemble classifier can accurately identify invasive Phragmites\u00a0australis from RGB and multispectral imagery. Accuracies greater than 80% were attained by the voting-based ensemble classifier for both the RGB and multispectral imagery. The highest accuracy, 91%, was achieved when using the multispectral imagery, a canopy height model, and a post-ML OBIA rule set. The study emphasizes the need for further research regarding the accurate identification of Phragmites australis at low stem densities.", "venue": "Remote Sensing", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-07-12", "journal": {"name": "Remote.
