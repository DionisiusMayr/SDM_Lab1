In the meanwhile, the objects are often associated with attributes such as timestamps and prices. Many scenarios need to jointly query the vector representations of the objects together with their attributes. These queries can be formalized as range-filtering approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) queries. Specifically, given a collection of data vectors, each associated with an attribute value whose domain has a total order. The range-filtering ANNS consists of a query range and a query vector. It finds the approximate nearest neighbors of the query vector among all the data vectors whose attribute values fall in the query range. Existing approaches suffer from a rapidly degrading query performance when the query range width shifts. The query performance can be optimized by a solution that builds an ANNS index for every possible query range; however, the index time and index size become prohibitive -- the number of query ranges is quadratic to the number n of data vectors. To overcome these challenges, for the query range contains all attribute values smaller than a user-provided threshold, we design a structure called the segment graph whose index time and size are the same as a single ANNS index, yet can losslessly compress the n ANNS indexes, reducing the indexing cost by a factor of \u03a9(n). To handle general range queries, we propose a 2D segment graph with average-case index size O(n log n) to compress n segment graphs, breaking the quadratic barrier. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets show that our proposed structures outperformed existing methods significantly; our index also exhibits superior scalability.", "venue": "Proceedings of the ACM on Management of Data", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-03-12", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the ACM on Management of Data"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1643863405", "name": "Chaoji Zuo"}, {"authorId": "2291608461", "name": "Miao Qiao"}, {"authorId": "2240462287", "name": "Wenchao Zhou"}, {"authorId": "2237407596", "name": "Feifei Li"}, {"authorId": "2064605227", "name": "Dongjie Deng"}], "citations": []}
