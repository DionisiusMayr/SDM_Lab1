Security issues are exacerbated when e-government service providers trade their services within a centralised framework. Due to security concerns, city-centric centralised services are being converted to blockchain-based systems, which is a very time-consuming and challenging process. The interoperability of these blockchain-based systems is also more challenging due to protocol variances, an excessive amount of local transactions that raise scalability and rapidly occupy memory. In this paper, we have proposed a framework for interoperability across various blockchain-based smart city services. It also summarises how independent service providers might continue self-service choices (i.e., local transactions) without overloading the blockchain network and other organisations. A simulated interoperability network is used to show the network\u2019s effectiveness. The experimental outcomes show the scalability and memory optimization of the blockchain network.", "venue": "Electronics", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2023-02-19", "journal": {"name": "Electronics"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2150473600", "name": "S.
