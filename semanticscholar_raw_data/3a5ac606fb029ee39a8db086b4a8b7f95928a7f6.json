Associative Memory models or AMs are differentiable neural networks defining a recursive dynamical system, which have been integrated with various deep learning architectures. We uncover a novel connection between the AM dynamics and the inherent discrete assignment necessary in clustering to propose a novel unconstrained continuous relaxation of the discrete clustering problem, enabling end-to-end differentiable clustering with AM, dubbed ClAM. Leveraging the pattern completion ability of AMs, we further develop a novel self-supervised clustering loss. Our evaluations on varied datasets demonstrate that ClAM benefits from the self-supervision, and significantly improves upon both the traditional Lloyd's k-means algorithm, and more recent continuous clustering relaxations (by upto 60% in terms of the Silhouette Coefficient).", "venue": "International Conference on Machine Learning", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-06-05", "journal": {"pages": "29649-29670"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2069140481", "name": "Bishwajit Saha"}, {"authorId": "145753925", "name": "D.
