In the era of internet of things (IoT) tools, connected agriculture has appeared. Big data outputs can be exploited by the future connected agriculture in order to reduce cost and time production, improve yield, develop new products, offer optimization and smart decision-making. In this article, we propose a functional framework to model the decision-making process in digital and connected agriculture.", "venue": "Indonesian Journal of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2021-12-01", "journal": {"name": "Indonesian Journal of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1396659028", "name": "Loubna Rabhi"}, {"authorId": "2634624", "name": "N.
