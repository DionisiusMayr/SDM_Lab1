Security risks are very common owing to the occurrence of exposures. One of the head-on effects of the security risks is data leakage that involves email addresses, credit card numbers, etc. The exposure of sensitive data is a serious threat to the confidentiality of organizational and personal data and it could occur due to both accidental and malicious attacks. Though numerous gears have been established to discover and fix the security risks, novel trials are evolving in the large data epoch, such asslier attacks, mounting scope of datasets for mining security risks, large data sets\u2019 exposure poses threats to the confidentiality of private information.", "venue": "2018 14th International Wireless Communications & Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2018-06-01", "journal": {"name": "2018 14th International Wireless Communications & Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)", "pages": "1368-1372"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2319989", "name": "S.
