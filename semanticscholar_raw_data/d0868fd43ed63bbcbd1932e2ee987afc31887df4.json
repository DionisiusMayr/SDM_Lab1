These patterns are designed to summarize common properties of tuples associated with particular values of the measure attributes. We provide a categorization of the characteristics of patterns produced by various solutions to this problem, we point out the pros, cons and performance optimizations of existing methods, and we suggest directions for future research.", "venue": "International Workshop on Data Warehousing and OLAP", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"pages": "116-120"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2285679174", "name": "Lukasz Golab"}, {"authorId": "145860176", "name": "D.
