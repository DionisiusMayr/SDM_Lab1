This includes data ingestion, storage, and processing to data governance, security, and visualization. The main components of big data management are data warehousing, data governance, data processing, data visualization, data security, cloud storage, and data lakes. Big data management comprises three main components: data framework, storage, and optimization. This study presents many frameworks, data storage, and big data analysis optimization strategies. The approaches, difficulties, and future directions of the big data analysis and optimization research were summarized.", "venue": "International Conference Electronic Systems, Signal Processing and Computing Technologies [ICESC-]", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-07-06", "journal": {"name": "2023 4th International Conference on Electronics and Sustainable Communication Systems (ICESC)", "pages": "1747-1753"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "66517620", "name": "Peerzada Hamid Ahmad"}, {"authorId": "73657010", "name": "Munishwar Rai"}], "citations": []}
