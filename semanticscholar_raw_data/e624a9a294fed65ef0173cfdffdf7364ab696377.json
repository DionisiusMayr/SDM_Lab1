While the accessibility community has explored ways to make data more accessible to blind and low-vision (BLV) people, little is known about how BLV people perform DDA. Knowing BLV people\u2019s strategies and challenges in DDA would allow the community to make DDA more accessible to them. Toward this goal, we conducted a mixed-methods study of interviews and think-aloud sessions with BLV people (N=16). Our study revealed five key approaches for DDA (i.e., overview obtaining, column comparison, key statistics identification, note-taking, and data validation) and the associated challenges. We discussed the implications of our findings and highlighted potential directions to make DDA more accessible for BLV people.", "venue": "International ACM SIGACCESS Conference on Computers and Accessibility", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle", "Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-10-22", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 25th International ACM SIGACCESS Conference on Computers and Accessibility"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2115485723", "name": "Chutian Jiang"}, {"authorId": "2153838294", "name": "Wentao Lei"}, {"authorId": "2115694650", "name": "Emily Kuang"}, {"authorId": "2154279289", "name": "Teng Han"}, {"authorId": "2204644498", "name": "Mingming Fan"}], "citations": []}
