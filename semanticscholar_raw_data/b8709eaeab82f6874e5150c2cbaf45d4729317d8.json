It has been widely used in data processing and analysis. SQL-like queries are also playing important roles in data analysis. In this paper, we study different approaches to optimize SQL-like queries in MapReduce and evaluate them on benchmark dataset in a Hadoop cluster. The result shows that these optimizations including adjust join order, push down predicates and merge different MapReduce tasks can significantly speed up analytical queries.", "venue": "", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2018-01-10", "journal": {"name": "DEStech Transactions on Computer Science and Engineering", "volume": ""}, "authors": [{"authorId": "47362246", "name": "Qin Liu"}, {"authorId": "2093217338", "name": "Haijie Hong"}, {"authorId": "2608808", "name": "Hongming Zhu"}, {"authorId": "33908381", "name": "Hongfei Fan"}], "citations": []}
