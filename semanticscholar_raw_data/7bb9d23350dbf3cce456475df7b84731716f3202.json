As expected, revenue is also affected by promotions, and a dedicated budget usually limits monetary losses. In order to allocate promotions efficiently within budget constraints, a marketer can use causal machine learning based personalization along with constrained optimization tools. In this paper we study four decision levers of promotional campaigns, allowing optimal and personalized offers allocation within budget constraints. We demonstrate the optimization problems in real-life promotional campaigns and formulate them as variations of the Knapsack problem, allowing us to introduce efficient applied solutions. We demonstrate that such solutions have a significant impact on promotional campaigns at Booking.com - a world leading online travel platform.", "venue": "MORS@RecSys", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "48832237", "name": "Dmitri Goldenberg"}, {"authorId": "2051972227", "name": "Javier Albert"}, {"authorId": "2106773219", "name": "Guy Tsype"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "073a932d5acd4ae9f1d21507f0642c1568b691dc", "title": "Personalizing Benefits Allocation Without Spending Money: Utilizing Uplift Modeling in a Budget Constrained Setup"}, {"paperId": "f528062fc162af0b0eff973e55902d2db196e318", "title": "MORS 2021: 1st Workshop on Multi-Objective Recommender Systems"}, {"paperId": "69b2fa0adb990e433d361ca78a112a35a0caffca", "title": "E-Commerce Promotions Personalization via Online Multiple-Choice Knapsack with Uplift Modeling"}]}
