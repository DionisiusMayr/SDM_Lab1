Cloud computing is a service which provides services by handling massive amount of data. To handle it effectively it needs some technology like Hadoop. Hadoop is an open source project written in java. It is optimised to handle massive amount of data (structured, unstructured, semi-structured) through parallelism. Thus to achieve this parallelism Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) uses Mapreduce as a programming index. Here proposing a translator which converts Matlab commands to Mapreduce commands especially concentrated in executing some basic commands in Mapreduce environment to access large datasets. Matlab is a very effective tool for numerical computing since executing this command in a platform independent, distributed environment makes it more efficient.", "venue": "", "year": 2016, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2016-05-05", "journal": {"name": "Research Journal of Applied Sciences, Engineering and Technology", "pages": "900-906", "volume": "12"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "19449607", "name": "T.
