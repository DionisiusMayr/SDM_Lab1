We worked with a sample of 49 third-year students in a Health Science degree during a lockdown caused by COVID-19. Three follow-ups were carried out over a semester: an initial one, an intermediate one and a final one with the UBUMonitor tool. This tool is a desktop application executed on the client, implemented with Java, and with a graphic interface developed in JavaFX. The application connects to the selected Moodle server, through the web services and the REST API provided by the server. UBUMonitor includes, among others, modules for log visualisation, risk of dropping out, and clustering. The visualisation techniques of boxplots and heat maps and the cluster analysis module (k-means ++, fuzzy k-means and Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) were used to monitor the students. A teaching methodology based on project-based learning (PBL), self-regulated learning (SRL) and continuous assessment was also used. The results indicate that the use of this methodology together with early detection and personalised intervention in the initial follow-up of students achieved a drop-out rate of less than 7% and an overall level of student satisfaction with the teaching and learning process of 4.56 out of 5.", "venue": "Applied Sciences", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2021-03-17", "journal": {"name": "Applied Sciences"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1403114218", "name": "M.
