The roots of this challenge trace back to the use of nuclear energy in various fields, whether in the production of electricity or in military aspects. Amidst this increasing use, the nature of nuclear damages becomes evident, imposing on scientists and researchers the necessity to carefully consider how to counteract the negative effects and adopt measures that reduce the severity of this phenomenon. This research aims to understand the depth of the nature of nuclear damages, analyze the difference between nuclear damages and conventional damages, and recognize the characteristics of nuclear damages that distinguish them from other types of damages. Understanding the nature of nuclear damages is a vital step towards developing effective strategies for preserving the environment and ensuring the safety of humanity amidst the continuous advancement of nuclear technology.", "venue": "International Journal of Religion", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-02-23", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Religion"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2287269869", "name": "Abdulrahman Ahmad N.
