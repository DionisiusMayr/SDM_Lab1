These challenges include reverse power flow, voltage fluctuations, power quality issues, dynamic stability, big data challenges and others. This paper investigates the existing challenges with the current level of PV penetration and looks into the challenges with high PV penetration in future scenarios such as smart cities, transactive energy, proliferation of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), possible eclipse events, big data issues and environmental impacts. Within the context of these future scenarios, this paper reviewed the existing solutions and provides insights to new and future solutions that could be explored to ultimately address these issues and improve the smart grid\u2019s security, reliability and resiliency.", "venue": "Energies", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering"], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2018-07-06", "journal": {"name": "Energies"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "50847274", "name": "T.
