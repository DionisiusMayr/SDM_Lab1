While current algorithms can identify the local outliers in the clusters, they do not relocate them to their correct clusters. Also, modifications of K-means addresses problems including time complexity, identifying the initial centroids and number of clusters, and preventing the occurrence of outliers in every cluster, but only a few focused on relocating the local outliers to their correct clusters. Hence, this paper introduces a Local Outlier Reclassifier (LORec) method capable of relocating local outliers generated by K-means. Results of the study using the three datasets show that the LORec integrated into K-means improved its clustering performance. The generation of false-positive instances is reduced by an average of 25.01%. Additionally, the integration yielded an average improvement of 8.50 % accuracy, 5.39% in the rand index, and 8.9% in f-measure. These results indicate that integrating LORec into K-means is an effective method for relocating local outliers to their correct clusters.", "venue": "International Conference on Software Technology and Engineering", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-10-27", "journal": {"name": "2023 13th International Conference on Software Technology and Engineering (ICSTE)", "pages": "143-150"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1471383303", "name": "Rogelio O.
