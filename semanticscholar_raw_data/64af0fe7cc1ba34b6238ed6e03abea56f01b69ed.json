It is very difficult for medical practitioners and doctors to predict accurate about heart disease diagnosis. Data science is one of the more important things in early prediction and solves large data problems now days. This research paper describes the prediction of heart disease in medical field by using data science. As many researches done research related to that problem but the accuracy of prediction is still needed to be improved. So, this research focuses on feature selection techniques and algorithms where multiple heart disease datasets are used for experimentation analysis and to show the accuracy improvement. By using the Rapid miner as tool; Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Logistic Regression SVM, Na\u00efve Bayes and Random Forest; algorithms are used as feature selection techniques and improvement is shown in the results by showing the accuracy.", "venue": "International Bhurban Conference on Applied Sciences and Technology", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"],
