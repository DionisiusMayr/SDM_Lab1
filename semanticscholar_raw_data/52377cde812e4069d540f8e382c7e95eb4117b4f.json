Uplinks and downlinks to the cloud or a back end data center are provided by gateway nodes that also have a vehicle-to-cloud (V2C) communication interface. We now go beyond this initial architecture and consider quite heterogeneous communication technologies deployed at each vehicle. In particular, we assume that each vehicle is equipped with either V2V or V2C communication, or both so that it can also act as a gateway between the different worlds. We call the resulting system hybrid micro clouds. In this paper, we present means for hybrid micro cloud formation such that every vehicle can exchange data with other vehicles as well as with the back end data center. In our performance evaluation, we looked at the position error of neighboring vehicles in the local knowledge bases compared to the ground truth as a metric.", "venue": "Conference on Computer Communications Workshops", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-05-02", "journal": {"name": "IEEE INFOCOM 2022 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)", "pages": "1-2"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "8812644", "name": "Gurjashan Singh Pannu"}, {"authorId": "38076247", "name": "Seyhan U\u00e7ar"}, {"authorId": "1741334", "name": "Takamasa Higuchi"}, {"authorId": "1767587", "name": "O.
