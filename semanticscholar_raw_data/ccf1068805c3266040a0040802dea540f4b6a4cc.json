This paper aims to provide a review of the literature about data fragmentation and replication methods applied in a cloud environment in the last eight years, to determine if the methods take into account both techniques (fragmentation and replication) together, consider a cloud database, are easy to implement, are focused on improving the performance of the database, are complete (i.e., the paper includes all the necessary information to implement the method), and if they provide a cost model. To meet this objective we analyzed and classified 83 papers concerning data fragmentation and replication techniques. Finally, we selected the best method of our comparative analysis and presented an architecture of a web application for data fragmentation and replication in the cloud based on such method.", "venue": "International Conference on Electronics, Communications, and Computers", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2019-02-01", "journal": {"name": "2019 International Conference on Electronics, Communications and Computers (CONIELECOMP)", "pages": "47-54"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1723959965", "name": "F.
