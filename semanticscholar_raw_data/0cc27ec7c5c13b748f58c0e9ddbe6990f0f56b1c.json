Mobile applications that process or share large amounts of data use the cloud to overcome the resource constraints imposed by smartphones and tablets. These systems bring new challenges in terms of fault tolerance. On the one hand, they operate on batteries whose charge has a limited duration and, on the other hand, the mobility of the user can make it difficult to obtain continuous connectivity and with invariable bandwidth as would be desirable. In this work, we study cloud technologies, from their main applications, to the challenges they currently face. We studied the Azure and Firebase persistence mechanisms of offline data. Next, we propose fault-tolerance mechanisms for two types of common cloud computing failures: battery failure and network failure. And, finally, we evaluate and compare the mechanisms proposed by the native mechanisms (Azure and Firebase).", "venue": "", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Environmental Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2019-07-24", "journal": {"name": "", "volume": ""}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1580464974", "name": "E.
