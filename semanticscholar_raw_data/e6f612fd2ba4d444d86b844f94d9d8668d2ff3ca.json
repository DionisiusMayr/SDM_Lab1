In this context, the management of shared information is critical to effective and reliable collaboration. Blockchain technology supports disruptive and distributed IP management solutions, especially in a multi-stakeholder environment. This research investigates opportunities to apply blockchain to support collaborative roadmapping. First, a literature review was conducted to identify potential benefits provided by blockchain technologies. The connections between the collaborative roadmapping gaps and potential blockchain benefits were translated into research opportunities. Blockchain by nature can support two unsolved gaps in collaborative roadmapping: confidentiality and security. Additionally, the research reveals three new potential benefits of blockchain technologies: certification, shared value, and traceability.", "venue": "Sustainability", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-10-13", "journal": {"name": "Sustainability"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2085858896", "name": "I.
