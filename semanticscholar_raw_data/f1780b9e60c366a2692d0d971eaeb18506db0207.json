Currently, the local search is a considerable choice in ensuring both computational complexity and optimization. Based on our previous research on multi-route search algorithm to reduce makespan, we apply BFDO and LPTO algorithms to address load balancing and bin-packing problems. Through abundant experiments, we validate the superiority of our proposed BFDO and LPTO.", "venue": "International Conference on Cloud Computing and Intelligence Systems", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-08-12", "journal": {"name": "2023 IEEE 9th International Conference on Cloud Computing and Intelligent Systems (CCIS)", "pages": "521-525"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2110809426", "name": "Guangyao Zhou"}, {"authorId": "2253653720", "name": "Wenhong Tian"}, {"authorId": "1709598", "name": "R.
