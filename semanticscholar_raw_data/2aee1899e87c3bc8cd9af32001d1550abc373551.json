SpMV performs indirect memory references as a result of storing the sparse matrix in a compressed format, and irregular memory accesses to the input vector due to the spar-sity pattern of the input matrix [1]\u2013[3]. Thus, in CPU and GPU systems, SpMV is a primarily memory-bandwidth-bound ker-nel for the majority of real sparse matrices, and is bottlenecked by data movement between memory and processors [3]\u2013[6].", "venue": "IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-07-01", "journal": {"name": "2022 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI (ISVLSI)", "pages": "288-291"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "46175739", "name": "Christina Giannoula"}, {"authorId": "2061067079", "name": "Ivan Fernandez"}, {"authorId": "1388812849", "name": "Juan G\u00f3mez-Luna"}, {"authorId": "1774783", "name": "N.
