They do not cope well with the multitude of storage devices that are competitive at their price `sweet spots'. To make use of different storage device classes, users have to resort to workarounds, such as storing data in different tablespaces. A lot of research has been done on heterogeneous storage frameworks for distributed big data query engines. These engines scale well for big data sets but are often CPU- or network-bound. Both approaches only maximize performance for previously purchased storage devices. We present Mosaic, a storage engine for scan-heavy workloads on RDBMS that manages devices in a tierless pool and provides device purchase recommendations for a specified workload and budget. In contrast to existing systems, Mosaic generates a performance/budget curve that is Pareto-optimal, along which the user can choose. Our approach uses device models and linear optimization to find a data placement solution that maximizes I/O throughput for the workload. Our evaluation shows that Mosaic provides a higher throughput at the same budget or a similar throughput at a lower budget than the state-of-the-art approaches of big data query engines and RDBMS.", "venue": "Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-07-01", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment", "pages": "2662 - 2675", "volume": "13"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2001008961", "name": "Lukas Vogel"}, {"authorId": "46249201", "name": "Alexander van Renen"}, {"authorId": "1996787", "name": "S.
