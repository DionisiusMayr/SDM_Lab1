In a wide-area environment, dynamics are common not only because of the workload variability but also the nature of wide-area network (WAN) bandwidth that frequently changes. In this work, we study the adaptability property of stream processing systems designed for a wide-area environment. Speci\ufb01cally, we (1) discuss the challenges of recon\ufb01guring query executions in a wide-area environment, (2) propose ideas how to adapt existing recon\ufb01guration techniques used in centralized Cloud to a wide-area environment, and (3) discuss the trade-offs between them. A key \ufb01nding is that the best adaptation technique to use depends on the network conditions, types of query, and optimization metrics.", "venue": "USENIX Workshop on Hot Topics in Cloud Computing", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "", "volume": ""}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3418111", "name": "A.
