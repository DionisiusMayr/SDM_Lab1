This paper aims to construct a class of memristive neural networks (MNNs) with a simple circular connection relationship and complex dynamics by introducing a generic memristor as synapse. For placing the memristive synapse in different coupling positions, three MNNs with the same coupling cyclic connection are yielded. One remarkable feature of the proposed MNNs is that they can yield complex dynamics, in particular, abundant coexisting attractors and large-scale parameter-relied amplitude control, by comparing with some existing MNNs. Taking one of the MNNs as an example, the complex dynamics (including chaos, period-doubling bifurcation, symmetric coexisting attractors, large-scale amplitude control) and circuit implementation are studied . The number of equilibria and their stabilities are discussed. The parameter-relied dynamic evolution and the coexisting attractors are numerically shown by using bifurcations and phase portraits. A microcontroller-based hardware circuit is given to realize the network, which verifies the correctness of the numerical results and experimental results.", "venue": "Chaos", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-07-01", "journal": {"name": "Chaos", "volume": "33 7"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2350009", "name": "Q.
