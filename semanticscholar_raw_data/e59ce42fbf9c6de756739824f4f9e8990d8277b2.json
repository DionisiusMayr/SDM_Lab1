Meanwhile, exploiting the massive parallelism of GPU to accelerate online analytical processing (OLAP) has been extensively explored in the database community. In this paper, we present GHive, which enhances CPU-based Hive via CPU-GPU heterogeneous computing. GHive is designed for the business intelligence applications and provides the same API as Hive for compatibility. To run SQL queries jointly on both CPU and GPU, GHive comes with three key techniques: (i) a novel data model gTable, which is column-based and enables efficient data movement between CPU memory and GPU memory; (ii) a GPU-based operator library Panda, which provides a complete set of SQL operators with extensively optimized GPU implementations; (iii) a hardware-aware MapReduce job placement scheme, which puts jobs judiciously on either GPU or CPU via a cost-based approach. In the experiments, we observe that GHive outperforms Hive in both query processing speed and operating expense on the Star Schema Benchmark (SSB).", "venue": "ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book"], "publicationDate": "2022-11-07", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 13th Symposium on Cloud Computing"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2143856694", "name": "Haotian Liu"}, {"authorId": "2084612700", "name": "Bo Tang"}, {"authorId": "2169863164", "name": "Jiashu Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2170046802", "name": "Yangshen Deng"}, {"authorId": "145837716", "name": "Xiao Yan"}, {"authorId": "3155405", "name": "Xinying Zheng"}, {"authorId": "2647686", "name": "Qiaomu Shen"}, {"authorId": "39422721", "name": "Dan Zeng"}, {"authorId": "2169798543", "name": "Zunyao Mao"}, {"authorId": "1931691545", "name": "Chaozu Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2120458025", "name": "Zhengxin You"}, {"authorId": "2169824091", "name": "Zhihao Wang"}, {"authorId": "2169798086", "name": "Runzhe Jiang"}, {"authorId": "7572514", "name": "Fang Wang"}, {"authorId": "1722082", "name": "Man Lung Yiu"}, {"authorId": "2143213767", "name": "Huan Li"}, {"authorId": "2111857152", "name": "Mingji Han"}, {"authorId": "2170038947", "name": "Qian Li"}, {"authorId": "2169789115", "name": "Zhenghai Luo"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "cde959deaf38e5bfaeb1f66cc0b77d21d6dcd09d", "title": "QEVIS: Multi-Grained Visualization of Distributed Query Execution"}, {"paperId": "47da72a952b4d9e724242e45f6d3a9402479ce27", "title": "Towards Building The Next Generation Computation Engine"}, {"paperId": "1079b2a414cd6349fb26b60fab9ae96e84c65280", "title": "Skadi: Building a Distributed Runtime for Data Systems in Disaggregated Data Centers"}, {"paperId": "af9ac6a6f52f1609e5a86176f5301d3277219f38", "title": "A Comparative Study of the Performance of Real time databases and Big data Analytics Frameworks"}]}
