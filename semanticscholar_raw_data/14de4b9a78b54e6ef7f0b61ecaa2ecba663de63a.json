It addresses the research question, \u201cWhat combinations of scaffolding characteristics, contexts of use, and assessment levels lead to medium and large effect sizes among college\u2010 and graduate\u2010level engineering and technology learners?\u201d To do so, studies in which scaffolding led to a medium or large effect size within the context of technology and engineering education were identified within a scaffolding meta\u2010analysis data set. Next, two\u2010step cluster analysis in SPSS 24 was used to identify distinct groups of scaffolding attributes tailored to learning computer science at the undergraduate and graduate levels. Input variables included different scaffolding characteristics, the context of use, education level, and effect size. There was an eight\u2010cluster solution: five clusters were associated with large effect size, two with medium effect size, and one with both medium and large effect size. The three most important predictors were the context in which scaffolding was used, if and how scaffolding is customized over time and the decision rules that govern scaffolding change. Notably, highly effective scaffolding clusters are associated with most levels of each predictor.", "venue": "Computer Applications in Engineering Education", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-08-22", "journal": {"name": "Computer Applications in Engineering Education", "pages": "1795 - 1812", "volume": "30"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2203674", "name": "B.
