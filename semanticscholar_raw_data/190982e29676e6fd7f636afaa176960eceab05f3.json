However, with the growing adoption of cloud services, ensuring the accuracy and validation of common processes through machine learning and clustering of these common concepts as well as of the processes generated by cloud forensics experts\u2019 data in cloud environments has become a paramount concern. The current paper proposes an innovative approach to enhance the data collection procedure in cloud environments by applying a Cloud Forensic Meta-Model (CFMM) and integrating it with machine learning techniques to improve the cloud forensic data. Through this approach, consistency and compatibility across different cloud environments in terms of accuracy are ensured. This research contributes to the ongoing efforts to validate the clustering process for data collection in cloud computing environments and advance the field of cloud forensics for standardizing the representation of cloud forensic data, certifying NMI and accuracy across different cloud environments.", "venue": "Engineering, Technology &amp; Applied Science Research", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-02-08", "journal": {"name": "Engineering, Technology &amp; Applied Science Research"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2284003200", "name": "\u064dRafef Al-mugern"}, {"authorId": "2283999841", "name": "Siti Hajar Othman"}, {"authorId": "1404405096", "name": "Arafat Al-dhaqm"}], "citations": []}
