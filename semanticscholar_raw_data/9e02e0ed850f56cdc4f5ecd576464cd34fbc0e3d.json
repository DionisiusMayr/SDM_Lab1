However, the performance of the traditional Storm framework can no longer meet current needs due to explosive growth of data in Internet of Things. In this article, FPGA is integrated as the computing node into the Strom framework, and two optimization methods are proposed for the framework to improve system performance. We use matrix multiplication to evaluate the optimized system. When the matrix size is 256\u00d7256, the FPGA-based Storm system has a maximum reduction of 37.10% in the average processing delay of tuples compared to the native Storm system. When the computing resources of the FPGA are large enough, the matrix size of the optimal optimization rate will also increase by increasing the parameter setting of the expansion degree.", "venue": "2022 3rd International Conference on Big Data, Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things Engineering (ICBAIE)", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-07-15", "journal": {"name": "2022 3rd International Conference on Big Data, Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things Engineering (ICBAIE)", "pages": "303-307"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1668720186", "name": "Honglei Li"}, {"authorId": "2072794598", "name": "Jia You"}, {"authorId": "2116203894", "name": "Xisheng Li"}, {"authorId": "2198039859", "name": "Weiren Song"}], "citations": []}
