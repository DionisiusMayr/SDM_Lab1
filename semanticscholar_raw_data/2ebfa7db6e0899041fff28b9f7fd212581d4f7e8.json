Specifically interesting is the case in which tabular data have a time dependence, such as, for instance financial transactions. However, the heterogeneity of the tabular values, in which categorical elements are mixed with numerical items, makes this adaptation difficult. In this paper we propose a Transformer architecture to represent heterogeneous time-dependent tabular data, in which numerical features are represented using a set of frequency functions and the whole network is uniformly trained with a unique loss function.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-02-13", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2302.06375"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1752943984", "name": "Simone Luetto"}, {"authorId": "2205545535", "name": "Fabrizio Garuti"}, {"authorId": "1716310", "name": "E.
