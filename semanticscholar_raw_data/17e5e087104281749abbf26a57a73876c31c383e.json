Today cloud computing is one of the most widely used technologies. Its applications include Multi-cloud, healthcare, testing, finance, data storage and handling big data to increase efficiency and how it differs from traditional systems. We have stated how cloud computing can be used in various domains and have compared its efficiency to traditional systems in terms of data recovery, access control, management, security and cost. However, like any other technology, this one too might have flaws which can be exploited. This paper also lists the security challenges that will have to be kept in mind while implementing these systems.", "venue": "International Conference on Computing Communication and Networking Technologies", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2020-07-01", "journal": {"name": "2020 11th International Conference on Computing, Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)", "pages": "1-8"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1564568314", "name": "Vidhi Mody"}, {"authorId": "1564568310", "name": "Vrushti Mody"}, {"authorId": "1992781689", "name": "Soham Parekh"}], "citations": []}
