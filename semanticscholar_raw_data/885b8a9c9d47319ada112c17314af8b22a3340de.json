The risk of acquiring infections may increase during the visit of patients to the hospitals. The utilisation of technology such as the \u201cInternet of Things (IoT)\u201d based on Fog Computing and Cloud Computing turned out to be efficient in enhancing the healthcare quality services for the patients. The present paper aims at gaining a better understanding and insights into the most effective and novel IoT-based applications such as Cloud Computing and Fog Computing and their implementations in the healthcare field. The research methodology employed the collection of the information from the databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, and Science Direct. There are five research articles selected after 2015 based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria set for the study. The findings of the studies included in this paper indicate that IoT-based Fog Computing and Cloud Computing increase the delivery of healthcare quality services to patients. The technology showed high efficiency in terms of convenience, reliability, safety, and cost-effectiveness. Future studies are required to incorporate the models that provided the best quality services using the Fog and Cloud Computation techniques for the different user requirements. Moreover, edge computing could be used to significantly enhance the provision of health services at home.", "venue": "Electronics", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2021-05-02", "journal": {"name": "Electronics", "pages": "1077", "volume": "10"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "48761742", "name": "M.
