We aim at proposing this API as a simple programming model in C language that can potentially permit an easy interface between DF-Threads and generic programming models. Clusters are typically programmed with MPI, therefore we evaluated our approach against OpenMPI. If we consider the delivered GFLOPS per core, DF-Threads are also competitive in respect to CUDA. In the basic examples, that we used in this initial investigation, DF-Threads achieve better performance-per-core compared to OpenMPI and CUDA. In particular, OpenMPI has a large portion of OS-kernel activity, which is slowing down its performance.", "venue": "International Symposium on High Performance Computing Systems and Applications", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2019-07-01", "journal": {"name": "2019 International Conference on High Performance Computing & Simulation (HPCS)", "pages": "165-168"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1816975", "name": "R.
