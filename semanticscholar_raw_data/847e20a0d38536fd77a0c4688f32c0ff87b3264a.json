Firstly, the ant colony algorithm is broken down into two subgroups, and the symbiosis, cohabitation, and parasite mechanisms in the symbiotic algorithm are used to prevent the algorithm from getting into a local optimum and speed it up to obtain the optimal solution. As a result, the cloud computing scheduling simulation results show that the ant colony algorithm-symbiotic algorithm has good performance in terms of virtual machine load balancing, task completion time, and task completion cost, proving that the proposed algorithm can effectively improve the efficiency of cloud computing task scheduling.", "venue": "International Journal of Performability Engineering", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2019-09-30", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Performability Engineering"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "47480934", "name": "Li Yuxia"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "cc3d52a3a3bd1e9563493254e503b6700f182cc9", "title": "A Comparative Study of Meta-Heuristic-Based Task Scheduling in Cloud Computing"}]}
