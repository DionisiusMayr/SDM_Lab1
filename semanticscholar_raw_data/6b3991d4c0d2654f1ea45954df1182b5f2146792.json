This strategy can result in an impressive asset that can streamline operational costs, reduce time to market, and enable the creation of new products. However, several Big Data challenges may take place in enterprises when it comes to moving initiatives of boardroom discussions to effective practices. From a broader perspective, we take on this paper two very important challenges, namely modeling, and management. The main context here is to highlight the importance of understanding data modeling and knowing how to process complex data while supporting the characteristics of each model.", "venue": "2023 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Systems and Emergent Technologies (IC_ASET)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-04-29", "journal": {"name": "2023 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Systems and Emergent Technologies (IC_ASET)", "pages": "1-6"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "22250492", "name": "Rania MKHININI GAHAR"}, {"authorId": "2459451", "name": "Olfa Arfaoui"}, {"authorId": "8649470", "name": "Minyar Sassi Hidri"}], "citations": []}
