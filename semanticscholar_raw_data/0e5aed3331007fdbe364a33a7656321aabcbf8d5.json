Moreover, 5G and vehicular networking are expected to play an important role in supporting TMSs for providing a smarter, safer and faster transportation. In this way, several infrastructure-based TMSs have been proposed to improve vehicular traffic mobility. However, in massively connected and multi-service smart city scenarios, infrastructure-based systems can experience low delivery ratios and high latency due to packet congestion in backhaul links on ultra-dense cells with high data traffic demand. In this sense, we propose I am not interested in it (IAN3I), an interest-based approach for reducing network contention and even avoid infrastructure dependence in TMS. IAN3I enables a fully-distributed traffic management and an opportunistic content sharing approach in which vehicles are responsible for storing and delivering traffic information only to vehicles interested in it. Simulation results under a realistic scenario have shown that, when compared to state-of-the-art approaches, IAN3I decreases the number of transmitted messages, packet collisions and latency in up to 95%, 98% and 55% respectively while dealing with traffic efficiency properly, not affecting traffic management performance at all.", "venue": "Italian National Conference on Sensors", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2019-05-01", "journal": {"name": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "volume": "19"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1886588", "name": "A.
