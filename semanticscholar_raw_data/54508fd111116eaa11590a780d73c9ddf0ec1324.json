However, the interactions of screen-reader users with online geospatial data visualizations, commonly used by visualization creators to represent geospatial data (e.g., COVID-19 cases per US state), remain unexplored. In this work, we study the interactions of and information extraction by screen-reader users from online geospatial data visualizations. Specifically, we conducted a user study with 12 screen-reader users to understand the information they seek from online geospatial data visualizations and the questions they ask to extract that information. We utilized our findings to generate a taxonomy of information sought from our participants\u2019 interactions. Additionally, we extended the functionalities of VoxLens\u2014an open-source multi-modal solution that improves data visualization accessibility\u2014to enable screen-reader users to extract information from online geospatial data visualizations.", "venue": "International ACM SIGACCESS Conference on Computers and Accessibility", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-10-22", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 24th International ACM SIGACCESS Conference on Computers and Accessibility"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "21548954", "name": "Ather Sharif"}, {"authorId": "2188645988", "name": "Andrew M.
