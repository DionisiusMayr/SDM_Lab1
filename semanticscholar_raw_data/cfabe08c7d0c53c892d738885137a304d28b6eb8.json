It comprises of smart devices and applications connected to each other using internet. These devices like sensors, wearable health monitors, smart security systems etc, are continuously collecting data and monitoring people around it. All this data collected by the smart devices results in Big Data. When it comes to handling big data, safeguarding this sensitive data from hackers and cyber bullies is a difficult task. Apart from this, Big Data collection also gives rise to some serious ethical and legal issues. While in most countries there are now laws to deal with these issues, it is still a complicated task to tackle these cyber activities as they are not governed geographically. In the paper below we discuss the different technologies we can utilize, and the various cyber laws introduced to prevent the ethical and legal problems occurring due to the use of these IoT devices.", "venue": "2021 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Knowledge Economy (ICCIKE)", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2021-03-17", "journal": {"name": "2021 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Knowledge Economy (ICCIKE)", "pages": "529-534"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2086795961", "name": "Bushra Siddiqua Oosman"}, {"authorId": "35201918", "name": "R.
