Nonetheless, very little empirical evidence has so far been put forward about the contribution of BD capabilities towards a firm performance and Competitive Advantage (CA). This research examines the impact of Big Data Technological Capabilities (BDTC) and Big Data Personal Capabilities (BDPC) on firms\u2019 performance with a mediating role of CA among the firms operating in the world\u2019s top emerging economy such as China. Data were collected through structured questionnaires using a sample size of 312 firms. The hypotheses were tested in AMOS.21 using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). The results indicate that BDTC and BDPC have significant positive impact on firm performance and CA and there is also significant positive relationship between CA and firm performance. The study highlights that CA partially mediates the relationship between BDTC and firm performance as well as between BDPC and firm performance. Hence, BD-oriented firms achieve CA which in turn leads to superior performance in dynamic markets. This study discussed implications for managerial practices.", "venue": "Journal of Information & Knowledge Management", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Business"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2018-12-01", "journal": {"name": "J.
