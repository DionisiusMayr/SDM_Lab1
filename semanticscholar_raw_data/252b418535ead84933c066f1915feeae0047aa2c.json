To avoid those pitfalls when realizing such undertakings, at the beginning, it is necessary to develop an in-depth understanding of those causes. This contribution analyses twelve real world case studies, from the big data and related domains, which were facing issues. The causes for the experienced problems were extracted and thereupon categorized, facilitating the understanding of practitioners and researchers that are engaged in the big data domain. Furthermore, potential avenues for future research are highlighted.", "venue": "International Conference on Internet of Things, Big Data and Security", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"pages": "453-460"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "133861075", "name": "D.
