In cloud systems, load balancing, strong fault tolerance, and resource optimisation all heavily depend on virtual machine (VM) migration. New paradigms for virtual machine (VM) distribution have been created by recent advances in machine learning (ML) heuristics, allowing for the dynamic and intelligent allocation of computing resources. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive examination of the heuristic uses of machine learning for migrating cloud-based virtual machines.", "venue": "2023 3rd International Conference on Technological Advancements in Computational Sciences (ICTACS)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-11-01", "journal": {"name": "2023 3rd International Conference on Technological Advancements in Computational Sciences (ICTACS)", "pages": "1455-1462"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2202130576", "name": "Gurpreet Singh Panesar"}, {"authorId": "2277665786", "name": "Raman Chadha"}], "citations": []}
