Effectiveness of such time critical computing systems is dependent not only on the accuracy of the result produced, but also on the time in which it was computed. In this paper, we present a distributed architecture capable of detecting possible collisions, groundings, unexpected communication gaps and travel pattern deviations of ships fitted with Automatic Identification System transponders. Our results demonstrate that the proposed system can achieve good accuracy and sub second latency in real world conditions.", "venue": "Oceans", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2019-06-01", "journal": {"name": "OCEANS 2019 - Marseille", "pages": "1-8"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3472832", "name": "K.
