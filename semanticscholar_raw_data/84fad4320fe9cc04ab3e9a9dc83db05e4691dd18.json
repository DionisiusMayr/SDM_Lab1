In detail, the main research contributions of the thesis are: 1. Definition of the new concept of heterogeneity for Big Data Architectures (Chapter 2); 2. Investigation of the performance of Big Data systems (e.g. Hadoop) in virtualized environments (Section 3.1); 3. Investigation of the performance of NoSQL databases versus Hadoop distributions (Section 3.2); 4. Execution and evaluation of the TPCx-HS benchmark (Section 3.3); 5. Evaluation and comparison of Hive and Spark SQL engines using benchmark queries (Section 3.4); 6. Evaluation of the impact of compression techniques on SQL-on-Hadoop engine performance (Section 3.5); 7. Extensions of the standardized Big Data benchmark BigBench (TPCx-BB) (Section 4.1 and 4.3); 8. Definition of a new benchmark, called ABench (Big Data Architecture Stack Benchmark), that takes into account the heterogeneity of Big Data architectures (Section 4.5). The thesis is an attempt to re-define system benchmarking taking into account the new requirements posed by the Big Data applications. With the explosion of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and new hardware computing power, this is a first step towards a more holistic approach to benchmarking.", "venue": "", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "29758338", "name": "Todor Ivanov"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "f976d17cb4aff953f07392ee3b66617c71d68c5b", "title": "Tutorial on Benchmarking Big Data Analytics Systems"}, {"paperId": "498648efbf87c366d2f688621b2adc96acae81bb", "title": "Scope of Digital Waste Exchange Platforms in India"}]}
