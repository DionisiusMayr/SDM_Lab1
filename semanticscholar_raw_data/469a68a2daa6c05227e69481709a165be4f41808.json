As data size increases, a need arises to resolve the significant increase in the disk $I/O$ of reducer nodes, which may cause runtime bottlenecks. In response, we propose Bucket MapReduce, a system that utilizes bucket sort and pipeline parallelism to improve the performance of Hadoop MapReduce. Several parameters may influence the performance in Bucket MapReduce, and thus we will further discuss parameter tuning. In this paper, we perform experiments on TeraSort benchmark. Bucket MapReduce successfully reduces local disk $I/O$ by 61% and improves the runtime by 1. 39x in 800GB TeraSort benchmark.", "venue": "International Euromicro Conference on Parallel, Distributed and Network-Based Processing", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2021-03-01", "journal": {"name": "2021 29th Euromicro International Conference on Parallel, Distributed and Network-Based Processing (PDP)", "pages": "18-25"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2118439781", "name": "Kairui Chen"}, {"authorId": "2115401142", "name": "Hsin-Yuan Chen"}, {"authorId": "66577850", "name": "Chien-Min Wang"}], "citations": []}
