The performance of in-situ processing across a query workload is, however, limited by the speed of full scan, tokenizing, and parsing of the entire data. Online aggregation (OLA) has been introduced as an efficient method for data exploration that identifies uninteresting patterns faster by continuously estimating the result of a computation during the actual processing---the computation can be stopped as early as the estimate is accurate enough to be deemed uninteresting. However, existing OLA solutions have a high upfront cost of randomly shuffling and/or sampling the data. In this paper, we present OLA-RAW, a bi-level sampling scheme for parallel online aggregation over raw data. Sampling in OLA-RAW is query-driven and performed exclusively in-situ during the runtime query execution, without data reorganization. This is realized by a novel resource-aware bi-level sampling algorithm that processes data in random chunks concurrently and determines adaptively the number of sampled tuples inside a chunk. In order to avoid the cost of repetitive conversion from raw data, OLA-RAW builds and maintains a memory-resident bi-level sample synopsis incrementally. We implement OLA-RAW inside a modern in-situ data processing system and evaluate its performance across several real and synthetic datasets and file formats. Our results show that OLA-RAW chooses the sampling plan that minimizes the execution time and guarantees the required accuracy for each query in a given workload. The end result is a focused data exploration process that avoids unnecessary work and discards uninteresting data.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2017-02-01", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/1702.00358"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "145215470", "name": "Yu Cheng"}, {"authorId": "47749019", "name": "Weijie Zhao"}, {"authorId": "2289824", "name": "Florin Rusu"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "3ab7d56383ba4ce9c54ca0796f9cd31ca78ee427", "title": "Linked Data Visualization: Techniques, Tools, and Big Data"}, {"paperId": "e0cef440098e1a0f75870f307134fc1b21c18f5f", "title": "Code Generation Techniques for Raw Data Processing"}, {"paperId": "dc66136ffd22c9fcc0b436c0acef99265a39223d", "title": "Bi-Level Online Aggregation on Raw Data"}]}
