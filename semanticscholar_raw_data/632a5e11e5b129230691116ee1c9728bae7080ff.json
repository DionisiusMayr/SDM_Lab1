We propose a programming-by-example system, ALPS, to synthesize Datalog programs from input-output examples. Scaling synthesis to realistic programs in this manner is challenging due to the rich expressivity of Datalog. We present a syntax-guided synthesis approach that prunes the search space by exploiting the observation that in practice Datalog programs comprise rules that have similar latent syntactic structure. We evaluate ALPS on a suite of 34 benchmarks from three domains\u2014knowledge discovery, program analysis, and database queries. The evaluation shows that ALPS can synthesize 33 of these benchmarks, and outperforms the state-of-the-art tools Metagol and Zaatar, which can synthesize only up to 10 of the benchmarks.", "venue": "ESEC/SIGSOFT FSE", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book"], "publicationDate": "2018-10-26", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 2018 26th ACM Joint Meeting on European Software Engineering Conference and Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2457284", "name": "X.
