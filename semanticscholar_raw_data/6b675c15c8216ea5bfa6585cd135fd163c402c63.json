The method assumes that partially labeled data belonging to different classes are continuously available during time in form of chunks. Each chunk is processed by semi-supervised fuzzy clustering leading to a cluster-based classification model. The proposed DISSFCM is capable of dynamically adapting the number of clusters to data streams, by splitting low-quality clusters so as to improve classification quality. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data show the effectiveness of the proposed method in data stream classification.", "venue": "Int. J. Artif. Intell.
