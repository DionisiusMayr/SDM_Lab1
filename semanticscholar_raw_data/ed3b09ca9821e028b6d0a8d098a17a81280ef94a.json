My current work includes long term collaborations with rural Alaska Native communities to describe and test effectiveness of culturally-based intervention to promote protective factors in prevention of youth suicide and substance abuse. I also work in a collaboration describing community-level protective mechanisms predictive of low suicide rates in rural Alaska Native communities, and cultural and spiritual factors in opioid use disorder treatment and prevention in Pacific Northwest and Minnesota tribal communities. Methods: Quantitative - RCTs, Quantitative - observational data, Qualitative - focus groups, Qualitative - in-depth interviews, Mixed methods, Community engaged/participatory research, Quantitative - Quasi-experimental, SMART, and Adaptive Designs Methods Description: My methods focus includes life history qualitative interviewing in understanding cultural processes in health and well-being, and collaborative approaches to coding and interpretive analysis of qualitative data with communities of concern. I also have interested in recent developments in classical and modern measurement theory, particularly in its application to culturally distinct settings and the measurement of protective factors. Finally, I have interest in contemporary approaches to modeling in testing theory and intervention in small populations research, including recent applications of multilevel and Bayesian approaches.
