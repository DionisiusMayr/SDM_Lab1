And big data and artificial intelligence are also closely related to container technology. For instance, the architecture for computing-storage separation and the distributed training of large models are uninterruptedly dependent upon container technology. Numerous container-based applications require robust management tool suites. Although Kubernetes is a well-known tool for container orchestration, its native scheduling is not tailored towards offline workloads, like big data and artificial intelligence. In this context, this paper first examines the principles of Kubernetes native scheduler and identifies the challenges encountered when dealing with batch tasks, then presents the concept, the workflow, and integration methods of batch schedulers, and finally summarizes its significant features and several open-source frameworks. Ultimately, enterprises\u2019 IT infrastructure is continuously moving towards cloud and containerization. Comprehensive scheduling architectures that support both online and offline tasks are crucial, as they significantly impact the enterprise\u2019s overall IT scalability, efficiency, and business outcomes. Therefore, this area has garnered the industry\u2019s attention.", "venue": "Conference on Computer Science and Communication Technology", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-10-11", "journal": {"pages": "129181A - 129181A-8", "volume": "12918"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2257370967", "name": "Xuemin Wang"}, {"authorId": "2198613494", "name": "Yang Han"}], "citations": []}
