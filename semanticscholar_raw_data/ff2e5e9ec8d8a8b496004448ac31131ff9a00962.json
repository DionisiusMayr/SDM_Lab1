This requires system based structures and technologies for you to procedure. Map - reduce a distributed parallel programming model runs on hadoop surroundings, approaches massive volumes of information. A parallel programming technique can be relevant to the linear regression algorithm and support vector machines algorithm from the system getting to know network to parallelize acceleration on the multicore system for efficient timing efficiency", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2020-03-01", "journal": {"name": "Journal of emerging technologies and innovative research", "volume": ""}, "authors": [{"authorId": "72033424", "name": "Nikhil N.
