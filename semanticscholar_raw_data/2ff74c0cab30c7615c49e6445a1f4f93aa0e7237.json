Through an evaluation metric that quantifies the minimal reliability among all NFs for all demands, service providers and operators may better facilitate flexible NF service recovery and migration, thus offering higher service reliability. In this paper, we present evaluation metrics on NFV reliability and solution approaches to solve robust NFV under random NF\u2010enabled node failure(s). We demonstrate how to construct an auxiliary NF\u2010enabled network and its mapping onto the physical substrate network. With the constructed NF\u2010enabled network, we develop pseudo\u2010polynomial algorithms to solve the robust NF and SFC s\u2009\u2212\u2009t path problems: subproblems of robust NFV. We also present approximation algorithms for robust NFV with the SFC\u2010Fork as the NF forwarding graph. Furthermore, we propose exact solution approaches via mixed\u2010integer linear programming under the general setting. Computational results show that our proposed solution approaches are capable of managing robust NFV in a large\u2010size network.", "venue": "Networks", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2019-12-09", "journal": {"name": "Networks", "pages": "438 - 462", "volume": "75"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2238412", "name": "Tachun Lin"}, {"authorId": "2149134097", "name": "Zhili Zhou"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "79ca3d8d719466c107c86201875a49ceba89c1e6", "title": "Multiobjective Optimization Model and Algorithm Based on Differential Brain Storm for Service Path Constructing"}, {"paperId": "427415e2cb5ed9e87e8fb1de2bc22b900e70aa85", "title": "In search of network resilience: An optimization\u2010based view"}]}
