For this, a capability-aware optimization that can optimize and partition the queries is demonstrated. This optimization for the hardware is based on its capabilities. Our hardware can also generate statistics of the data while executing a query. In contrast to the existing approaches, this does not have any additional costs in terms of execution time. We will demonstrate how these statistics are later used by the DBMS to select the best plan from the search space using accurate cost values.", "venue": "International Conference on Extending Database Technology", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"pages": "639-642"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2203551474", "name": "Lekshmi B.G"}, {"authorId": "144554777", "name": "Andreas Becher"}, {"authorId": "1399432410", "name": "K.
