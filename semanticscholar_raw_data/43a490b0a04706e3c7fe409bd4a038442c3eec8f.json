This paper presents a case study of a near-mountainous alluvial plain in Southern Taiwan. The Hakka ethnic group is the main community in the study area and also the main research object. This case study illustrates the disaster resilience of the community to natural and artificial disasters. This study adopted two research approaches, namely historical geography and political economic geography, as well as community resilience theory. Research methods including case study, secondary literature analysis, fieldwork, and interviews were used. Through text analysis, it was found that (1) the community\u2019s awareness of disaster avoidance was rooted in the experience of reclamation in the early 17th century; (2) communities have experienced artificial disasters caused by political and economic intervention, which have been transformed into disaster awareness and community resilience; (3) cumulative artificial disasters have a greater impact on communities than unpredictable natural disasters; and (4) the energy of community resilience and agricultural regeneration is based on the duality of disasters.", "venue": "Water", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-05-28", "journal": {"name": "Water"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3258726", "name": "Shu-Chen Tsai"}, {"authorId": "108249195", "name": "Su-Hsin Lee"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "7ffe94e50f2f21cc71718aa1ca3f1417c9603597", "title": "On the tailor-made water governance mechanism for Taiwan's semiconductor industry"}]}
