Rubato DB employs the staged grid architecture with a novel formula based protocol for distributed concurrency control. Our demonstration will present Rubato DB as one NewSQL database management system running on a collection of commodity servers against two of benchmark sets. The demo attendees can modify the configuration of system size, fine-tune the query workload, and visualize the performance on the fly by the graphical user interface. Attendees can experiment with various system scales, and thus grasp the potential scalability of Rubato DB, whose performance, with the increase of the number of servers used, can achieve a linear growth for both OLTP application with the strong consistency properties and key-value storage applications with the weak consistency properties.", "venue": "SIGMOD Conference", "year": 2015, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2015-05-27", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "38410481", "name": "Li-Yan Yuan"}, {"authorId": "2817542", "name": "Lengdong Wu"}, {"authorId": "2887414", "name": "Jia-Huai You"}, {"authorId": "2057506810", "name": "Yan Chi"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "6680bcc95154032b4cf300ae461745de427e7113", "title": "MoonKV: Optimizing Update-intensive Workloads for NVM-based Key-value Stores"}, {"paperId": "1f8a7bb883e3b6901b63b8638520c10776173dcf", "title": "Architectural assessment of NoSQL and NewSQL systems"}, {"paperId": "f4b50479e6deba768fd5bed1e70ee4abf3b74dc3", "title": "A Hybrid Partitioning Strategy for NewSQL Databases: The VoltDB Case"}, {"paperId": "817d8ebc8210272522b2ffe762a440cfa213b327", "title": "Errors and Complications in SQL Query Formulation"}, {"paperId": "7854d668d1581250553c10e0a4be64d7e4efcfcc", "title": "Highly Scalable Distributed Architecture for NoSQL Datastore Supporting Strong Consistency"}, {"paperId": "d49367e75070835b266a8b9af6257b7fa24ecba4", "title": "Optimization of Waiting Time in Complex RIA by Combined Pseudo-Hierarchical-Lazy-Loading Algorithm"}]}
