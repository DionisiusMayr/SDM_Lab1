The objective of the research is to conduct a systematic review of the literature through articles published in databases such as Scopus and Dimension. Thus, in order to perform a complete documentary analysis, inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to evaluate the quality of each article. Then, using a quantitative scale, articles were filtered according to author, period and country of publication, leaving a total of 86 articles from both databases. The methodology used was the one proposed by Kitchenham, and the conclusion reached was that the vast majority of companies do not make a major investment in the purchase of equipment and improvement of information technology (IT) infrastructure, exposing themselves to cyber-attacks that continue to grow every day. This research provides an opportunity for researchers, companies and entrepreneurs to consult so that they can protect their organization's most important assets.", "venue": "Indonesian Journal of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-09-01", "journal": {"name": "Indonesian Journal of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2226181511", "name": "Jenner Lavalle Sandoval"}, {"authorId": "2159798444", "name": "Domingo Hern\u00e1ndez Celis"}, {"authorId": "1491176516", "name": "M.
