BC can offer decentralized and secure data storage, while CV allows machines to learn and understand visual data. The integration of the two technologies holds massive promise for developing innovative applications that can provide solutions to the challenges in various sectors such as supply chain management, healthcare, smart cities, and defense. This review explores a comprehensive analysis of the integration of BC and CV by examining their combination and potential applications. It also provides a detailed analysis of the fundamental concepts of both technologies, highlighting their strengths and limitations. This paper also explores current research efforts that make use of the benefits offered by this combination. The BC can be used as an added layer of security in CV systems and also ensure data integrity, enabling decentralized image and video analytics. The challenges and open issues associated with this integration are also identified, and appropriate potential future directions are also proposed.", "venue": "IEEE Access", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-07-13", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Access", "pages": "107309-107330", "volume": "11"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "123551871", "name": "M.
