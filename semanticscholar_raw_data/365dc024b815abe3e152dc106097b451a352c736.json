In this work, automation control technology, Internet of Things (IoT) technology, artificial intelligence and big data analysis technology are combined and applied to the improvement and optimization of heating metering. It is attempted to build an intelligent metering management platform under the IoT. The entire heating system is optimized by optimizing the energy-saving plan and implementation approach. As a result, an intelligent metering management system based on the IoT is successfully built. The system can analyze the heating habits of users and other related key information as the heating data of users are monitored and understood in real time. Finally, the targeted regulation can be conducted to achieve the flexible heating.", "venue": "2022 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Data Science and Computer Application (ICDSCA)", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-10-28", "journal": {"name": "2022 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Data Science and Computer Application (ICDSCA)", "pages": "396-400"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "46696524", "name": "Lei Zhou"}, {"authorId": "2068005290", "name": "Zhen Gu"}, {"authorId": "2144192881", "name": "Jingyue Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2107454184", "name": "D.
