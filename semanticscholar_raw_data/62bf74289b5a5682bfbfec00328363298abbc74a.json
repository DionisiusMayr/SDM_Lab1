As a semantic segmentation task, the defect detection task has the problems of background\u2013foreground imbalance, multi-scale targets, and feature similarity between the background and defects in the real-world data. Conventionally, general convolutional neural network (CNN)-based networks mainly focus on natural image tasks, which are insensitive to the problems in our task. The proposed method has a network design for multi-scale segmentation based on the U-Net architecture including an atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) module and an inception module, and can detect various types of defects compared to conventional simple CNN-based methods. Through the experiments using a real-world subway tunnel image dataset, the proposed method showed a better performance than that of general semantic segmentation including state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we showed that our method can achieve excellent detection balance among multi-scale defects.", "venue": "Italian National Conference on Sensors", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-03-01", "journal": {"name": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "volume": "22"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2116560691", "name": "An Wang"}, {"authorId": "3470264", "name": "Ren Togo"}, {"authorId": "144392699", "name": "Takahiro Ogawa"}, {"authorId": "144029207", "name": "M.
