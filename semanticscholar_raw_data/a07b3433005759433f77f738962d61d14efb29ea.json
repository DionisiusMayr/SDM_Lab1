DashQL combines SQL, the grammar of relational database systems, with a grammar of graphics in a grammar of analytics. It supports preparing and visualizing arbitrarily complex SQL statements in a single coherent language. The proximity to SQL facilitates holistic optimizations of analysis workflows covering data input, encoding, transformations, and visualizations. These optimizations use model and query metadata for visualization-driven aggregation, remote predicate pushdown, and adaptive materialization. We introduce the DashQL language as an extension of SQL and describe the efficient and interactive processing of text-based analysis workflows.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-06-06", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2306.03714"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "39694066", "name": "Andr\u00e9 Kohn"}, {"authorId": "1714104", "name": "Dominik Moritz"}, {"authorId": "143993045", "name": "Thomas Neumann"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "5a2fe35ae481b9b524ef82754b04b904e778b6bd", "title": "Mosaic: An Architecture for Scalable & Interoperable Data Views"}]}
