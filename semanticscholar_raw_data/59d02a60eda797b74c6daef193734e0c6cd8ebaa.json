We formulated the organizational structure-based LLM workflow as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), where each node corresponds to an LLM and each edge to a communication protocol. Our workflow is benchmarked on 5 datasets from various domains, using 7 evaluation metrics. The results indicate that LLM organization could mitigate unfaithfulness and increase the overall performance of abstractive summarization methods.", "venue": "BigData Congress [Services Society]", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-12-15", "journal": {"name": "2023 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (BigData)", "pages": "6109-6112"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2208638938", "name": "Kriszti\u00e1n Boros"}, {"authorId": "2280386340", "name": "Masafumi Oyamada"}], "citations": []}
