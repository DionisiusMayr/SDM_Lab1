It holds promising opportunities as it is used to track human activities and vital signs using wearable devices and assist in diseases' diagnosis, and it can play a great role in elderly care and patient's health monitoring and diagnostics. With the great technological advances in medical sensors and miniaturization of electronic chips in the recent five years, more applications are being researched and developed for wearable devices. Despite the remarkable growth of using smart watches and other wearable devices, a few of these massive research efforts for machine learning applications have found their way to market. In this study, a review of the different areas of the recent machine learning research for healthcare wearable devices is presented. Different challenges facing machine learning applications on wearable devices are discussed. Potential solutions from the literature are presented, and areas open for improvement and further research are highlighted.", "venue": "Journal of Healthcare Engineering", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-04-18", "journal": {"name": "Journal of Healthcare Engineering", "volume": "2022"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "40182552", "name": "Farida Sabry"}, {"authorId": "80149750", "name": "T.
