To address this problem, we propose a learn-memorize-recall-reduce paradigm for robotic cloud computing. The learning stage converts incoming unstructured data into structured data; the memorization stage provides effective storage for the massive amount of data; the recall stage provides efficient means to retrieve the raw data; while the reduction stage provides means to make sense of this massive amount of unstructured data with limited computing resources.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2017-04-16", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/1704.04712"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "8603131", "name": "Shaoshan Liu"}, {"authorId": "1696332", "name": "Bolin Ding"}, {"authorId": "48252117", "name": "Jie Tang"}, {"authorId": "2116511125", "name": "Dawei Sun"}, {"authorId": "1682342", "name": "Zhe Zhang"}, {"authorId": "32713725", "name": "Grace Tsai"}, {"authorId": "144086037", "name": "J.
