Different numerical approaches to approximate exact solutions exist, that typically contain a multitude of parameters that can be tailored to the problem at hand. We explore how high-level provenance, i.e., provenance that is expensive to capture in a single simulation, can be used to optimize such parameters in future simulations for suf\ufb01ciently similar problems. Our experiments on one of the key building blocks of PDE simulations underline the potential of this approach.", "venue": "Workshop on the Theory and Practice of Provenance", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2086584957", "name": "Julia K\u00fchnert"}, {"authorId": "2914594", "name": "Dominik G\u00f6ddeke"}, {"authorId": "143677452", "name": "Melanie Herschel"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "8fc1c6eea7b18cf84db1144c646f69494578b93e", "title": "Towards Specificationless Monitoring of Provenance-Emitting Systems"}]}
