Geo-distributed graph processing suffers from the Wide Area Networks (WANs) with scarce and heterogeneous bandwidth, thus essentially differs from traditional distributed graph processing. In this paper, we propose RAGraph, a\n Region-Aware framework for geo-distributed graph processing.\n At the core of RAGraph, we design a region-aware graph processing framework that allows advancing inefficient global updates locally and enables sensible coordination-free message interactions. RAGraph also contains an adaptive hierarchical message interaction engine to switch interaction modes adaptively based on network heterogeneity and fluctuation, and a discrepancy-aware message filtering strategy to filter important messages. Finally, the experiments show that RAGraph can achieve 1.69X - 40.53X speedup and 20.9% - 97% WAN cost reduction compared with state-of-the-art systems.\n", "venue": "Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-11-01", "journal": {"name": "Proc.
