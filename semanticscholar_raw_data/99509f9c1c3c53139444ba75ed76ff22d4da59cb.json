IoT devices are often protected securely through firmware update. Traditional update methods have their shortcomings, such as bandwidth limitation and being attackers\u2019 easy targets. Although many scholars proposed a variety of methods that are based on the blockchain technology to update the firmware, there are still demerits existing in their schemes, including large storage space and centralized stored firmware. In summary, this research proposes a highly secure and efficient protection mechanism that is based on the blockchain technology to improve the above disadvantages. Therefore, this study can reduce the need of storage space and improve system security. The proposed system has good performance in some events, including firmware integrity, security of IoT device connection, system security, and device anonymity. Furthermore, we confirm the high security and practical feasibility of the proposed system by comparing with the existing methods.", "venue": "Italian National Conference on Sensors", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-01-01", "journal": {"name": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "volume": "22"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2563135", "name": "Woei-Jiunn Tsaur"}, {"authorId": "2149844903", "name": "Jen-Chun Chang"}, {"authorId": "2347199", "name": "Chin-Ling Chen"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "d68a42f6d44f5d1946f897cedca15ae2916715fc", "title": "A Trusted Authentication Scheme Using Semantic LSTM and Blockchain in IoT Access Control System"}, {"paperId": "ab03f880da64d68f9969ec3625c634b3c40829e0", "title": "MQTree: Secure OTA Protocol Using MQTT and MerkleTree"}, {"paperId": "71b824a8967ddecf50d0939f5c17c85c7815325d", "title": "Blockchain-based Model for Secure and Trusted IoT System"}, {"paperId": "1d50ea3b5028b4900b0fb0513fc8c61ffc8c7071", "title": "Securing IoT Firmware Dispatch Systems with Blockchain"}, {"paperId": "45daff7a6a67493e4aae02f3129b133bc36c0499", "title": "An Approach to Remote Update Embedded Systems in the Internet of Things"}, {"paperId": "0a29ce35069a5d8e71d04fada2abe6d353f995d7", "title": "Blockchain-Based Secure Firmware Update Using an UAV"}, {"paperId": "036e45e39b49cba8f644b5a7e6be2ccf5455ef8b", "title": "Survivability of industrial internet of things using machine learning and smart contracts"}, {"paperId": "8a849a9c0e17c8b10cb4684c87b3b1f7696d498d", "title": "Blockchain and LDP Based Smart Healthcare IoT Applications: Architecture, Challenges and Future Works"}, {"paperId": "5de975db5acf9caf42e0ee35def02737872d01e4", "title": "Smart Home IoT Cybersecurity Survey: A Systematic Mapping"}, {"paperId": "f4e8e0d1ed84532e4354fb9aacfa84274299042c", "title": "Modified Genetic Algorithm with Deep Learning for Fraud Transactions of Ethereum Smart Contract"}, {"paperId": "1a26d9d0b632efb38fba7ac5cac7bf9619c5d389", "title": "Improving IoT Data Security and Integrity Using Lightweight Blockchain Dynamic Table"}, {"paperId": "569091336d672e9c6a846c5915cf798f575d9ff2", "title": "A Machine Learning based Approach to Detect the Ethereum Fraud Transactions with Limited Attributes"}, {"paperId": "28c7be5ad3f18acff176058da1fae84d03b33315", "title": "Improving Agricultural Product Traceability Using Blockchain"}, {"paperId": "0844d8c4eb70fbeedc0e736795804d3a9fe76fc1", "title": "Enabling Secure Data Exchange through the IOTA Tangle for IoT Constrained Devices"}, {"paperId": "3248028dfcda7509782a8db8f7a92eba4edf0349", "title": "A Review of a Smart Roadside and On-Street Parking System"}, {"paperId": "27bbf74b5bae2ff5240a2d3bd301c95eb1bb3122", "title": "PARIOT: Anti-repackaging for IoT firmware integrity"}, {"paperId": "3c5873281f5d3d869b4b9d7fc15588ce8b7e779d", "title": "Securing the Internet of Things in Artificial Intelligence Era: A Comprehensive Survey"}, {"paperId": "f1315e823cb4fd3ffa45966577d563bc3552b77b", "title": "Exploring the Potential of Blockchain Technology in an IoT-Enabled Environment: A Review"}, {"paperId": "0efe0c71cd1604fcb412bf003913ad3a8e1fce19", "title": "Ensemble Deep Learning-Based Prediction of Fraudulent Cryptocurrency Transactions"}]}
