To this end, existing EC research has proposed several drone-based edge deployments for various purposes, such as data caching, task offloading, real-time video analytics, and computer vision. However, none of them consider the ability of keeping edge resources running across multiple drones in a single pool, to holistically manage and control these resources from a single federated plane as well as to eliminate vendor lock-in situations. This research presents an intelligent resource scheduling solution for a federated aerial EC system, called AirEdge, which jointly considers task dependencies, heterogeneous resource demand and drones' flight time. We propose a multi-task execution time estimation and a dispatching policy, to select the closest drone deployment having congruent flight time and resource availability to execute ready tasks at any given time. The selected drone is then deployed autonomously to the needed location. For the utilization of the drones' attached edge resources or cluster, we propose a variant bin-packing optimization approach through gang-scheduling of multi-dependent tasks that co-locates tasks tightly on nodes to fully utilize available resources. Extensive experiments on real-world data-trace from Alibaba cluster trace with information on task dependencies (about 12,207,703 dependencies) and resource demands show the effectiveness, fast executions, and resource efficiency of our approach.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology", "pages": "1-1", "volume": "PP"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2949956", "name": "Uchechukwu Awada"}, {"authorId": "30392575", "name": "Jiankang Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2145397190", "name": "Sheng Chen"}, {"authorId": "3227092", "name": "Shuangzhi Li"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "69fe63781479a70ccd52d5f5680d2a51206aba33", "title": "Resource-aware multi-task offloading and dependency-aware scheduling for integrated edge-enabled IoV"}, {"paperId": "76e38224399733097b3b2fcfb14ff01a18522603", "title": "Task scheduling of computation-intensive graph jobs in UAV-assisted hybrid vehicular networks"}, {"paperId": "ad6c0f7bbcf5916ee0163cb32ad7f13d9265730b", "title": "Joint UAV Trajectory Planning, DAG Task Scheduling, and Service Function Deployment Based on DRL in UAV-Empowered Edge Computing"}, {"paperId": "dbad5700ae29a7edda960dba32df92a144a74948", "title": "Edgedrones: Co-Scheduling of Drones for Multi-Location Aerial Computing Missions"}, {"paperId": "6cef7eb0b8548fbdd43f968df00bb0b4812f770e", "title": "Optimization of Edge Resources for Deep Learning Application with Batch and Model Management"}, {"paperId": "01709a885e34e102516f231309849214e576fa32", "title": "Dependency-Aware Task O\ufffdoading for Vehicular Edge Computing with End-Edge-Cloud Collaborative Computing"}]}
