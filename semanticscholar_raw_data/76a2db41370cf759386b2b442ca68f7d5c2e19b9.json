It is recognized by major search engines and data aggregators, making it easier for researchers to expose metadata describing their research outcomes. Here we present how Schema.org is used (or planned to be) by some NFDI consortia, becoming a lightweight approach to harmonize digital objects coming from different sources so they can be connected to each other in a meaningful way", "venue": "CoRDI", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-09-07", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the Conference on Research Data Infrastructure"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2198091927", "name": "Leyla Jael Castro"}, {"authorId": "2238639047", "name": "Juliane Fluck"}, {"authorId": "144905275", "name": "Daniel Arend"}, {"authorId": "144124793", "name": "Matthias Lange"}, {"authorId": "2238642339", "name": "Daniel Martini"}, {"authorId": "2238645146", "name": "Steffen Neumann"}, {"authorId": "2238644538", "name": "Sonja Schimmler"}, {"authorId": "2238642198", "name": "Dietrich Rebholz-Schuhmann"}], "citations": []}
