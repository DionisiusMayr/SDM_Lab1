In conjunction, Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) have evolved as long-range connectivity enabler with low management cost. The integration of LPWAN communication assists in reliable IoT operation with extended lifetime. Notable LPWAN technologies that contend for many of the IoT applications are LoRaWAN, DASH7, Sigfox, and NB-IoT. Most of the end-devices such as sensors and actuators are battery powered, therefore investigating energy consumption becomes crucial. To estimate the consumed power, it is important to analyze the energy consumption in wireless communication. This paper describes an empirical evaluation of energy consumption for LPWAN wireless technologies. We measure the current consumption of LoRaWAN, DASH7, Sigfox, and NB-IoT and derive the respective battery lifetime. These measurements help to quantify the energy performance of different protocols. We observe that LoRaWAN and DASH7 are more energy efficient when compared to Sigfox and NB-IoT. Finally, a case study on energy consumption is done on precision agriculture in the greenhouse, showing that battery lifetime in real applications can drop significantly from the ideal case. These results can be used for increasing the effectiveness of the IoT application by selecting the right technology and battery capacity.", "venue": "Italian National Conference on Sensors", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-08-25", "journal": {"name": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "volume": "20"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "152602933", "name": "Ritesh K.
