Therefore, a comprehensive fuzzy evaluation method for big data quality evaluation is proposed. Through the analysis of big data quality characteristics,abigdataqualityevaluationsystemforthewholeprocessofdataprocessingisconstructed.Thesubjectiveweight and objective weight of each indicator are calculated through the analytic hierarchy process and entropy method. In order to overcome the subjective and one-sided shortcomings of the single weight determination method, the subjective weight and the objective weight are organically integrated through the distance function method to determine the combined weight of each indicator. The quantified result of big data quality is obtained through fuzzy calculation of membership degree. Finally the ranking results of the proposed method are compared with those of some existing multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) methods.TheobtainedresultsindicatethattheproposedmethodisreasonableandefficienttodealwithMADMproblems.Itcan comprehensivelymeasurethelevelofbigdataquality,andprovideuserswithaccurateandefficientqualityevaluationresults. \u00a9 2021 The Authors .
