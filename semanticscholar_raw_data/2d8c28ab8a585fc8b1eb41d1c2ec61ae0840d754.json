In this paper, we address the above three challenges through the development of `BigExcel', a three tier web-based framework for exploring big data to facilitate the management of user interactions with large data sets, the construction of queries to explore the data set and the management of the infrastructure. The feasibility of BigExcel is demonstrated through two Yahoo Sandbox datasets. The first dataset is the Yahoo Buzz Score data set we use for quantitatively predicting trending technologies and the second is the Yahoo n-gram corpus we use for qualitatively inferring the coverage of important events. A demonstration of the BigExcel framework and source code is available at http://bigdata.cs.st-andrews.ac. uk/projects/bigexcel-exploring-big-data-for-social-sciences/.", "venue": "2014 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "year": 2014, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2014-10-01", "journal": {"name": "2014 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "pages": "84-91"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2113252012", "name": "Muhammed Asif Saleem"}, {"authorId": "1683999", "name": "B.
