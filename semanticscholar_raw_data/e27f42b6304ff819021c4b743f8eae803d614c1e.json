The fast development of Internet helps the organizations to capture data in many different formats through Internet of Things (IoT), social media and from other disparate sources. The dimension of the dataset increases day by day at an extraordinary rate resulting in large scale dataset with high dimensionality. The present paper reviews the opportunities and challenges of feature selection for processing the high dimensional data with reduced complexity and improved accuracy. In the modern big data world the feature selection has a significance in reducing the dimensionality and overfitting of the learning process. Many feature selection methods have been proposed by researchers for obtaining more relevant features especially from the big datasets that helps to provide accurate learning results without degradation in performance. This paper discusses the importance of feature selection, basic feature selection approaches, centralized and distributed big data processing using Hadoop and Spark, challenges of feature selection and provides the summary of the related research work done by various researchers. As a result, the big data analysis with the feature selection improves the accuracy of the learning.", "venue": "Ing\u00e9nierie des Syst\u00e8mes d Inf.", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "Ing\u00e9nierie des Syst\u00e8mes d Inf.", "pages": "67-77", "volume": "26"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "145174966", "name": "S.
