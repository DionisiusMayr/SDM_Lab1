However, because of its diversity and complexity, the necessary testing of the corresponding applications is a highly challenging task that lacks maturity and is still being explored. While there are numerous publications dealing with this topic, there is no sufficiently comprehensive overview to conflate those isolated pieces of information to a coherent knowledgebase. The publication at hand highlights this grievance by means of an unstructured literature review, proposes a starting point for a corresponding taxonomy to bridge this gap and highlights future avenues for research.", "venue": "International Conference on Internet of Things, Big Data and Security", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"pages": "296-302"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "133861075", "name": "D.
