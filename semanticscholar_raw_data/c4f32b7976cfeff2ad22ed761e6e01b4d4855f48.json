Remarkably, recent work has shown that one can find such a coloring even in the semi-streaming model: there exists a randomized algorithm that with high probability finds a (\u0394+1)-coloring of the input graph in only O(n\u00b7logn) space assuming a single pass over the edges of the graph in any arbitrary order. But, in reality, one almost never needs (\u0394+1) colors to properly color a graph. Indeed, the celebrated Brooks\u2019 theorem states that every (connected) graph beside cliques and odd cycles can be colored with \u0394 colors. Can we find a \u0394-coloring in the semi-streaming model as well? We settle this key question in the affirmative by designing a randomized semi-streaming algorithm that given any graph, with high probability, either correctly declares that the graph is not \u0394-colorable or outputs a \u0394-coloring of the graph. The proof of this result starts with a detour. We first (provably) identify the extent to which the previous approaches for streaming coloring fail for \u0394-coloring: for instance, all these approaches can handle streams with repeated edges and they can run in o(n2) time \u2013 we prove that neither of these tasks is possible for \u0394-coloring. These impossibility results however pinpoint exactly what is missing from prior approaches when it comes to \u0394-coloring. We then build on these insights to design a semi-streaming algorithm that uses (i) a novel sparse-recovery approach based on sparse-dense decompositions to (partially) recover the \u201dproblematic\u201d subgraphs of the input\u2014the ones that form the basis of our impossibility results\u2014and (ii) a new coloring approach for these subgraphs that allows for recoloring of other vertices in a controlled way without relying on local explorations or finding \u201daugmenting paths\u201d that are generally impossible for semi-streaming algorithms. We believe both these techniques can be of independent interest.", "venue": "Symposium on the Theory of Computing", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-03-21", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 54th Annual ACM SIGACT Symposium on Theory of Computing"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "35067898", "name": "Sepehr Assadi"}, {"authorId": "2108179629", "name": "Pankaj Kumar"}, {"authorId": "2159548298", "name": "Parth Mittal"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "2cb253429839576df35839fbc381480444a41aed", "title": "Recent Advances in Multi-Pass Graph Streaming Lower Bounds"}, {"paperId": "2fcd2dad5d9af04c31c4f7e77b062392f12ea1ec", "title": "Streaming Edge Coloring with Asymptotically Optimal Colors"}, {"paperId": "9761c58c2484841b05ccee4dab385cb0560f932e", "title": "Coloring Fast with Broadcasts"}, {"paperId": "3a95b745364c582ef14ad4a53e03cc4b04364293", "title": "A Distributed Palette Sparsification Theorem"}, {"paperId": "0792d8ad34761764bbd72edc900fa459a4933dfa", "title": "Coloring in Graph Streams via Deterministic and Adversarially Robust Algorithms"}, {"paperId": "9cbd5f205ab309397f05aaf9fb1dbc7dae8f9aac", "title": "Fast Distributed Brooks' Theorem"}, {"paperId": "3a3c0ec90ea20b1b08351a3928c2ed69f8ab044c", "title": "Rounds vs Communication Tradeoffs for Maximal Independent Sets"}, {"paperId": "866764ad8fce6833ffd17312581e17571d397b60", "title": "Deterministic graph coloring in the streaming model"}]}
