One of these new challenges is the identification of bus trajectories referenced by multiple predefined bus routes. This challenge becomes even more complicated when it involves a Big Data scenario, in which managing large volumes of data can exceed the capacity of traditional data processing systems, which demands parallel approaches capable of streamlining this data-intensive task. In this paper, we propose S-BULMA, an efficient parallel map-matching approach for solving this data-intensive problem. Our approach considers the context aspects of the trajectories performed by a bus, such as the analysis of trips performed along one day, to improve the classification of the predefined route that the bus is following. The evaluation results based on real-world open data sources show that S-BULMA outperforms an adapted technique (BoR-tech) based on the Bag-of-Roads strategy, in terms of map-matching effectiveness, and presents efficient parallel processing.", "venue": "Brazilian Symposium on Multimedia and the Web", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book"], "publicationDate": "2023-10-23", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 29th Brazilian Symposium on Multimedia and the Web"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1726468", "name": "Demetrio Gomes Mestre"}, {"authorId": "3480033", "name": "T.
