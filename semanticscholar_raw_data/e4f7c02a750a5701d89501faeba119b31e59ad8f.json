In this paper, we formulate the near-real-time notification decision problem as a Markov Decision Process where we optimize for multiple objectives in the rewards. We propose an end-to-end offline reinforcement learning framework to optimize sequential notification decisions. We address the challenge of offline learning using a Double Deep Q-network method based on Conservative Q-learning that mitigates the distributional shift problem and Q-value overestimation. We illustrate our fully-deployed system and demonstrate the performance and benefits of the proposed approach through both offline and online experiments.", "venue": "Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-07-07", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 28th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "51151974", "name": "Prakruthi Prabhakar"}, {"authorId": "2112499492", "name": "Yiping Yuan"}, {"authorId": "2175362071", "name": "Guangyu Yang"}, {"authorId": "2111844861", "name": "Wensheng Sun"}, {"authorId": "34299063", "name": "A.
