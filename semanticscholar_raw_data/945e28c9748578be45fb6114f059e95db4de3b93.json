With such a huge variety of machines to choose from, several con\ufb01gurations \u2013 sets of machines \u2013 can be formed. These con\ufb01gurations may yield similar performances with identical costs. Therefore, users have a hard time \ufb01nding the best one for deploying their speci\ufb01c workloads. This paper presents Lynceus, a long-sighted, budget-aware system for self-tuning of cloud applications, which uses a roll-out technique to search the space of possible con\ufb01gurations for the next best con\ufb01guration to try, without the overhead of a brute force search. We present numerical experiments demonstrating the cost savings achieved by our system when compared to state-of-the-art systems that neglect the cost of the exploration phase.", "venue": "", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2287362516", "name": "Maria da"}, {"authorId": "2287502989", "name": "Loura Casimiro"}, {"authorId": "2289291767", "name": "Jo\u02dcao Nuno de Oliveira"}, {"authorId": "2287164425", "name": "Paolo Romano"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "cc5076cc95faa4916fcd38b6683830f48ad10b21", "title": "Leveraging Subsampling Techniques to Optimize Machine Learning Jobs in the Cloud"}]}
