In this study, a UxV-assisted multi-user communications scenario is considered. By taking into account the tradeoff between the two objectives and the time-sequential movement of the UxV, two DRL-based actor-critic networks are integrated to solve the designated problem. In the first actor-critic network, the rate fairness is maximized by jointly optimizing a hybrid precoder with a UxV trajectory. Subsequently, considering the rate fairness as a learning reward of the first network, sum-rate is maximized in the second network under the consideration of transmission power budgets, limited UxV battery capacity, and quality of service (QoS) constraints. The results show that the D-DRL which considered rate fairness outperformed DRL which did not by achieving maximum rate fairness and a higher sum-rate.", "venue": "Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-11-19", "journal": {"name": "2023 28th Asia Pacific Conference on Communications (APCC)", "pages": "401-406"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "12917165", "name": "Silvirianti"}, {"authorId": "2268746464", "name": "Soo Young Shin"}], "citations": []}
