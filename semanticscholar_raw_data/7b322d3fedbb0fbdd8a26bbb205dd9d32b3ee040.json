While traditional relational databases still dominate, NoSQL databases are developing rapidly and occupy a place in the entire industry. Therefore, more and more applications need to connect to multiple database systems at the same time. However, the different characteristics supported by different database systems and the differences in query syntax rules make multi-database application development very complicated. This paper talks about a unified query middleware system that supports federated analytical queries with standard SQL syntax for various data sources and can perform joins, aggregates and filter on data from different data sources in a single query.", "venue": "Journal of Physics: Conference Series", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Physics", "Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2021-04-01", "journal": {"name": "Journal of Physics: Conference Series", "volume": "1873"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "49724380", "name": "Huiran Zhang"}, {"authorId": "50445747", "name": "C.
