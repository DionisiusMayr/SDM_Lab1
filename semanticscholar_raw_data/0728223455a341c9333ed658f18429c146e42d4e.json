High economic growth rates of developing countries increase their energy consumption. Energy policies, green energy and new technologies are emerging as priority issues in the energy market. Global energy consumption is expected to increase by 28% by 2040. The changing geographical and economic balances in energy reveal the necessity of producing long-term solutions to the changes in energy markets. Solar energy has begun a fundamental transformation from an old analogue system to a fully digital network. This paper have presented a perspective on digitalization of solar energy including the relationship and benefits of, blockchain, industry 4.0, artificial intelligence and big data.", "venue": "Journal of Scientific Perspectives", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2019-01-31", "journal": {"name": "Journal of Scientific Perspectives"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "152555365", "name": "N.
