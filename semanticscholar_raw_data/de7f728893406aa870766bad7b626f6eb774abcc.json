Rigger and Su applied metamorphic testing to alleviate the challenge. We propose a disjoint-partitioning approach to extend their work. We have conducted an empirical case study on OceanBase, the DBMS associated with the world's fastest online transaction processing system. Even though Ocean- Base has been extensively tested and widely used in the industry, we have unveiled various hidden failures and crashes.", "venue": "2022 IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering Workshops (ISSREW)", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-10-01", "journal": {"name": "2022 IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering Workshops (ISSREW)", "pages": "130-131"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2199245427", "name": "M.
