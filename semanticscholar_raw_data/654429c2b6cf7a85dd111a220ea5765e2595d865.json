In particular, we consider the large-scale two-sided matching applications where preferences of the users are specified as (ranking) functions over a set of attributes and matching recommendations are derived as top-k. We consider multiple natural explanation questions, concerning the users of these systems. Observing the competitive nature of these environments, we propose multiple Shapley-based approaches for explanation. Besides exact algorithms, we propose a sampling-based approximation algorithm with provable guarantees to overcome the combinatorial complexity of the exact Shapley computation. Our extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic data sets validate the usefulness of our proposal and confirm the efficiency and accuracy of our algorithms.", "venue": "International Conference on Extending Database Technology", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"pages": "584-596"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1442194534", "name": "Suraj Shetiya"}, {"authorId": "2174077107", "name": "Ian P.
