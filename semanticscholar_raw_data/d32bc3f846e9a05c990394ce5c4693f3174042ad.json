Recently, with Twitter\u2019s efforts in migrating ad-hoc clusters to the cloud, we evolved the SQL system into a hybrid-cloud SQL federation system, across Twitter\u2019s data centers and the public cloud, interacting with around 10PB of data daily. In this paper, we present the design of the hybrid-cloud SQL federation system, including query federation, cluster federation, and storage federation. We identify challenges in a modern SQL system and how our system helps to address them with some important design decisions. Finally, we reflect on a qualitative examination of lessons learned from the development and maintenance of such a SQL system.", "venue": "European Conference on Software Architecture", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "9655650", "name": "Chunxu Tang"}, {"authorId": "2117783202", "name": "Beinan Wang"}, {"authorId": "2119106461", "name": "Huijun Wu"}, {"authorId": "2108465976", "name": "Zhenzhao Wang"}, {"authorId": "2110976880", "name": "Yao Li"}, {"authorId": "2133416850", "name": "Vrushali Channapattan"}, {"authorId": "1490900889", "name": "Zhenxiao Luo"}, {"authorId": "2133417801", "name": "Ruchin Kabra"}, {"authorId": "2319032", "name": "Mainak Ghosh"}, {"authorId": "2133417351", "name": "Nikhil Kantibhai Navadiya"}, {"authorId": "2151851962", "name": "Prachi Mishra"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "192e1451b6e10b3ebd42b28521520926694353a1", "title": "Rethinking the Cloudonomics of Efficient I/O for Data-Intensive Analytics Applications"}, {"paperId": "f365bc53d9380f0d9dba603c766c7bc3e05c217b", "title": "Metadata Caching in Presto: Towards Fast Data Processing"}, {"paperId": "ac096edbb428e65efb65f9b10073336556b896c3", "title": "Serving Hybrid-Cloud SQL Interactive Queries at Twitter"}, {"paperId": "bda7c142cc19ba963a115199660e0c14ba234a12", "title": "From Batch Processing to Real Time Analytics: Running Presto\u00ae at Scale"}, {"paperId": "7d2d939cf471e500f8c59996ea5da82a92e3f5a5", "title": "Taming Hybrid-Cloud Fast and Scalable Graph Analytics at Twitter"}, {"paperId": "10eb3390f7f20a7bfe8b396ce8f969ea4eaae267", "title": "Move Real-Time Data Analytics to the Cloud: A Case Study on Heron to Dataflow Migration"}]}
