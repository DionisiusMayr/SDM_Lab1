The use of back-end data systems with different access latencies and data integration requirements poses new challenges that current data integration stacks based on distributed file systems\u2014proposed a decade ago for batch-oriented processing\u2014cannot address. In this paper, we describe Liquid, a data integration stack that provides low latency data access to support near real-time in addition to batch applications. It supports incremental processing, and is cost-efficient and highly available. Liquid has two layers: a processing layer based on a stateful stream processing model, and a messaging layer with a highly-available publish/subscribe system. We report our experience of a Liquid deployment with backend data systems at LinkedIn, a data-intensive company with over 300 million users.", "venue": "Conference on Innovative Data Systems Research", "year": 2015, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2015-06-05", "journal": {"name": "", "volume": ""}, "authors": [{"authorId": "34568734", "name": "R.
