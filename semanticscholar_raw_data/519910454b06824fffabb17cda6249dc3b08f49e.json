In addition to clusters, bridges and outliers detection is also a critical task as it plays an important role in the analysis of networks. Recently, several graph clustering methods are developed and used in multiple application domains such as biological network analysis, recommendation systems and community detection. Most of these algorithms are based on the structural clustering algorithm. Yet, this kind of algorithm is based on the structural similarity, this later requires to parse all graph ' edges in order to compute the structural similarity. However, the height needs of similarity computing make this algorithm more adequate for small graphs, without significant support to deal with large-scale networks. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed graph clustering algorithm based on structural graph clustering. The experimental results show the efficiency in terms of running time of the proposed algorithm in large networks compared to existing structural graph clustering methods.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2020-06-10", "journal": {"name": "", "volume": ""}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2006442819", "name": "Wissm Inoubli"}, {"authorId": "3172643", "name": "Sabeur Aridhi"}, {"authorId": "1736688", "name": "Haithem Mezni"}, {"authorId": "1795354", "name": "Mondher Maddouri"}, {"authorId": "1685621", "name": "E.
