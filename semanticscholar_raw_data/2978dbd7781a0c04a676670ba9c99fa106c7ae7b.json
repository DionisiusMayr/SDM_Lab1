Using Technologies of big data and web semantic are two new fields that can be exploiting to processes data semantically and to handle with storage of this hug data. In recent works [1, 2], we have proposed the techniques using in big data and we are proposed in architecture that integrate the big RDF (Resources Description Framework) data semantically by exploiting HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) to store Global RDF schema and Map Reduce to process the query, in aims to give an infrastructure who give a complete and pertinent answers to user query. In this paper we are proposed a simple scenario to have a complete and pertinent response to user query.", "venue": "Symposium on Computer Animation", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2019-10-02", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Smart City Applications"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "52238671", "name": "Lamrani Kaoutar"}, {"authorId": "2218372", "name": "A.
