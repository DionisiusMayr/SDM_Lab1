In order to achieve this, technology like MapReduce, Pig and HIVE came into action but when the question comes to scalability; Apache Spark maintains a great position far ahead. In this research paper, it has designed and developed an improved hybrid distributed collaborative model for filtering recommender engine. Execution time, scalability and robustness of the engine are the three evaluation parameters; has been considered for this present study. The present work keeps an eye on recommender system built with help of Apache Spark. Apart from this, it has been proposed and implemented the bisecting KMeans clustering algorithms. It has discussed about the comparative analysis between KMeans and Bisecting KMeans clustering algorithms on Apache Spark environment.", "venue": "International Journal of Intelligent Systems and Applications", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2018-07-08", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Intelligent Systems and Applications"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3399971", "name": "R.
