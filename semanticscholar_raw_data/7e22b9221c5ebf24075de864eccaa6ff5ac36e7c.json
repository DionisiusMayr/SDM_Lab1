ETL processes), which (in my opinion) still need substantial research. The questions include: (1) how to efficiently push down executions of DI tasks to non-relational data sources and (2) how to handle user-defined functions (especially treated as black-boxes) in optimizing the performance of DI processes. The discussion to be initiated during the panel is whether sound answers to these questions can be found by the support of machine learning techniques.", "venue": "International Workshop on Data Warehousing and OLAP", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"pages": "91-94"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1789686", "name": "R.
