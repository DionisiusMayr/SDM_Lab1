In this work, we propose GNNBench, a plug-and-play benchmarking platform focused on system innovation. GNNBench presents a new protocol to exchange their captive tensor data, supports custom classes in System APIs, and allows automatic integration of the same system module to many deep learning frameworks, such as PyTorch and TensorFlow. To demonstrate the importance of such a benchmark framework, we integrated several GNN systems. Our results show that integration with GNNBench helped us identify several measurement issues that deserve attention from the community.", "venue": "", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2024-04-05", "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2283096264", "name": "Yidong Gong"}, {"authorId": "2283092259", "name": "Pradeep Kumar"}], "citations": []}
