Its vertical federated learning version, SecureBoost, is one of the most popular algorithms used in cross-silo privacy-preserving modeling. As the area of privacy computation thrives in recent years, demands for large-scale and high-performance federated learning have grown dramatically in real-world applications. In this paper, to fulfill these requirements, we propose SecureBoost+ that is both novel and improved from the prior work SecureBoost. SecureBoost+ integrates several ciphertext calculation optimizations and engineering optimizations. The experimental results demonstrate that Secureboost+ has significant performance improvements on large and high dimensional data sets compared to SecureBoost. It makes effective and efficient large-scale vertical federated learning possible.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-10-21", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2110.10927"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "50503961", "name": "Weijing Chen"}, {"authorId": "2147432129", "name": "Guoqiang Ma"}, {"authorId": "2072650627", "name": "Tao Fan"}, {"authorId": "1505828520", "name": "Yan Kang"}, {"authorId": "144217477", "name": "Qian Xu"}, {"authorId": "153096457", "name": "Qiang Yang"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "d68ff1fdba49d5cd6888794f6216c72f98072c6e", "title": "Hyperparameter Optimization for SecureBoost via Constrained Multi-Objective Federated Learning"}, {"paperId": "32a258500131c1cd0112fc0a9dca11bbf556141a", "title": "An Interpretable Client Decision Tree Aggregation process for Federated Learning"}, {"paperId": "f7a0c9b2a2f5c280665fc8e24556dce3dbe0334f", "title": "Decision Tree-Based Federated Learning: A Survey"}, {"paperId": "07bcdc1c9f3f9a8ab8b918834ec9a7bedd9a1126", "title": "SpecFL: An Efficient Speculative Federated Learning System for Tree-based Model Training"}, {"paperId": "5aee8865fb79fda96df7ba37f2597af727e1a9a5", "title": "A Bargaining-based Approach for Feature Trading in Vertical Federated Learning"}, {"paperId": "a424e91e5127445cc7cd7cc0998395a6528890aa", "title": "A Survey of Privacy Threats and Defense in Vertical Federated Learning: From Model Life Cycle Perspective"}, {"paperId": "85a272bc9609128977dd095e6b7acecc98793cf8", "title": "SecureCut: Federated Gradient Boosting Decision Trees with Efficient Machine Unlearning"}, {"paperId": "70afbf5476f79bc57710502364977fc8bd19d153", "title": "VFLAIR: A Research Library and Benchmark for Vertical Federated Learning"}, {"paperId": "31da2244533fd583ffb98362c8d3547443857d78", "title": "Histogram-Based Federated XGBoost using Minimal Variance Sampling for Federated Tabular Data"}, {"paperId": "59c1504634c9eb1536a1026250e90b22f4391675", "title": "Fingerprinting generation for Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) detection using Machine Learning techniques"}, {"paperId": "375862a2f19a32f33185f0dfbc7f6dcffa63a334", "title": "Eliminating Label Leakage in Tree-Based Vertical Federated Learning"}, {"paperId": "756fb73ac54cb470ce4ac72d3fdc29da06dd899a", "title": "Privacy-Enhancing Technologies for Financial Data Sharing"}, {"paperId": "6b86236bdfa491ee2d6067520ef91c7baba55db8", "title": "Optimizing Privacy, Utility and Efficiency in Constrained Multi-Objective Federated Learning"}, {"paperId": "0107b93a2ffb0f4fc9ceea6340f4b75f07e351a8", "title": "FLBooster: A Unified and Efficient Platform for Federated Learning Acceleration"}, {"paperId": "a7f4ad71c9a80aeb023d779be533478e78511a62", "title": "A Survey of Trustworthy Federated Learning with Perspectives on Security, Robustness and Privacy"}, {"paperId": "c133816f3ead6e4b0f17cfb946bddd05a3f389e5", "title": "Vertical Federated Knowledge Transfer via Representation Distillation for Healthcare Collaboration Networks"}, {"paperId": "f13f014f51dd425661e3202067c5ef5052fe4d6a", "title": "Vertical Federated Learning"}, {"paperId": "857f628a32f9e8528778fa071f5cdde3c74c6218", "title": "Coresets for Vertical Federated Learning: Regularized Linear Regression and K-Means Clustering"}, {"paperId": "9b468d856a57735b4da281c4ab9d13d25ccb2cf1", "title": "Quantized Training of Gradient Boosting Decision Trees"}, {"paperId": "3557524bbd06db7c5173be3ca61399a87233bc9e", "title": "FederBoost: Private Federated Learning for GBDT"}, {"paperId": "bcc1b45ead83f78944f16b097fc88d4c26fb02d2", "title": "Squirrel: A Scalable Secure Two-Party Computation Framework for Training Gradient Boosting Decision Tree"}, {"paperId": "90b75c810a9da5b2074f76ec831a0b4b6efb3ba1", "title": "Differentially Private Vertical Federated Learning Primitives"}, {"paperId": "c7d4f0f83d549dc0ada863f5a298581aaeaa5009", "title": "NodeGuard: A Highly Efficient Two-Party Computation Framework for Training Large-Scale Gradient Boosting Decision Tree"}]}
