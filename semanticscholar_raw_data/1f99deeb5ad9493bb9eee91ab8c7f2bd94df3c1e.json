We propose knowledge graphs as the reference technology for the enterprise AI context, i.e., the complex of entities, properties and relationships that shape a business domain and constitute a common backbone for all AI-driven applications. We contribute and discuss principles to design software architectures for AI-driven applications based on knowledge graphs. We focus on the Vadalog system, a successful knowledge graph middleware from the University of Oxford and show knowledge graphs in action in a number of use cases from the financial domain.", "venue": "IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2019-04-08", "journal": {"name": "2019 IEEE 35th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE)", "pages": "26-37"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1716855", "name": "Luigi Bellomarini"}, {"authorId": "133826752", "name": "Daniele Fakhoury"}, {"authorId": "1684745", "name": "G.
