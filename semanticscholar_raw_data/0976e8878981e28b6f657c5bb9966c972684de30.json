For those applications, the ways of mapping parallel processes to physical nodes (i.e., \u201cprocess mapping\u201d) could significantly impact the performance of the applications because of non-uniform communication cost in geo-distributed environments. What's more, the different data privacy requirements in geo-distributed data centers pose additional constraints on process mapping solutions. While process mapping has been widely studied in grid/cluster environments, few of the existing studies have considered the problem in geo-distributed cloud environment, which is a challenging task due to the multi-level data privacy constraints, heterogeneous network performance and process failures. In this paper, we introduce the special privacy requirements in geo-distributed data centers and formulate the geo-distributed process mapping problem as an optimization problem with multiple constraints. We develop a new method to efficiently find good process mapping solutions to the problem. Experimental results on real clouds (including Amazon EC2 and Windows Azure) and simulations demonstrate that our proposed approach can achieve significant performance improvement compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2019-08-01", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems", "pages": "1872-1888", "volume": "30"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2494447", "name": "Amelie Chi Zhou"}, {"authorId": "2116642787", "name": "Yao Xiao"}, {"authorId": "2114981469", "name": "Yifan Gong"}, {"authorId": "143824511", "name": "Bingsheng He"}, {"authorId": "2467444", "name": "Jidong Zhai"}, {"authorId": "151498912", "name": "Rui Mao"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "14407cec730dbdd19d01cccb9f03ca3fb682cdd7", "title": "Computation and Communication Efficient Federated Learning With Adaptive Model Pruning"}, {"paperId": "0d92bb74ff88afc4948e8185dad210ce6f960505", "title": "Online Training Flow Scheduling for Geo-Distributed Machine Learning Jobs Over Heterogeneous and Dynamic Networks"}, {"paperId": "c683d1ace69a1f1188d2d7801b94cf09ba94473c", "title": "Towards Privacy-, Budget-, and Deadline-Aware Service Optimization for Large Medical Image Processing across Hybrid Clouds"}, {"paperId": "919a58ea7ec73db460b0ba4c56a3c570487657cf", "title": "Bifrost: Extending RoCE for Long Distance Inter-DC Links"}, {"paperId": "fe7418eb10abcaff767a983e7813136821829229", "title": "A Survey on Decentralized Federated Learning"}, {"paperId": "67742f0ddcc2a7286d5d6c2d8ff796d01792cc3a", "title": "Privacy vs. Efficiency: Achieving Both Through Adaptive Hierarchical Federated Learning"}, {"paperId": "a3b163d384eb50459133b6a2e67d911122e6a32f", "title": "An Efficient Parallel Reinforcement Learning Approach to Cross-Layer Defense Mechanism in Industrial Control Systems"}, {"paperId": "3355967a28481b816b4758119c72fa923bf988fa", "title": "Privacy-Preserving Cloud Computing: Ecosystem, Life Cycle, Layered Architecture and Future Roadmap"}, {"paperId": "b4e59046c96d911fa5174646d1943bb35afeb8ce", "title": "Privacy and security-aware workflow scheduling in a hybrid cloud"}, {"paperId": "3190a8eaffb50a9672d5710c07f8dc07689da7aa", "title": "Privacy-preserving workflow scheduling in geo-distributed data centers"}, {"paperId": "e792fe4c9303aa3503772da0fb63e3d83b5f0efb", "title": "O alinhamento entre learning analytics e a general data protection regulation"}, {"paperId": "257dfc6545e2211782902d12cc70e5d2a3bdda54", "title": "An energy-aware resource deployment algorithm for cloud data centers based on dynamic hybrid machine learning"}, {"paperId": "c211441fbc7ce3a34a555a45a00ad86bceb595d7", "title": "Management of geo-distributed intelligence: Deep Insight as a Service (DINSaaS) on Forged Cloud Platforms (FCP)"}, {"paperId": null, "title": "2020 Index IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems Vol. 31"}, {"paperId": "1dcd3ce2221eff4213487249978f7ec844f1c611", "title": "Communication-efficient Decentralized Machine Learning over Heterogeneous Networks"}, {"paperId": "7ea671f8953893f7a3a4625272d8fff5696efc1b", "title": "Learning Based Methods for Traffic Matrix Estimation From Link Measurements"}, {"paperId": "1c4b03ff95a8cdc22edb0d96e8d22498df847c3a", "title": "When Machine Learning Meets Privacy in 6G: A Survey"}, {"paperId": "037f6cbd6a73578d08b19ca7c20befa3d7c8d16e", "title": "Cost-Aware Partitioning for Efficient Large Graph Processing in Geo-Distributed Datacenters"}, {"paperId": "93d6752f11d5db3687cc9f895f219b1bed7e1023", "title": "A Survey on Federated Learning Systems: Vision, Hype and Reality for Data Privacy and Protection"}, {"paperId": "31d3c657987119aaa1e0b8306c0abbe84bf35222", "title": "A Survey on Scheduling Techniques in Computing and Network Convergence"}, {"paperId": "c13cc5b858b62ebb689a11e4b60cb7e745c465a5", "title": "Hybrid Deep Learning Framework for Privacy Preservation in Geo-Distributed Data Centre"}, {"paperId": "a26bca8d2a23967a5a7c1133f054658428f74145", "title": "SmartVM: A Smart Contract Virtual Machine for Fast on-Chain DNN Computations"}, {"paperId": "d80e74866169e335e341641d4cbc1b7cb8113068", "title": "Network-Aware Distributed Machine Learning Over Wide Area Network"}, {"paperId": "5e3a44f8f0b4267d79377d1f948500f65fe76726", "title": "Challenges, Applications and Design Aspects of Federated Learning: A Survey"}]}
