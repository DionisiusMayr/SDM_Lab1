Several dimensions of the Industry 4.0 field have been considered, such as the design of new products, workforce and skill optimisation, enhancing quality control, predictive maintenance, demand forecasting, and marketing strategy. The paper adopts qualitative research based on a critical review approach. It provides evidence of the GAI technology support in the mentioned areas. Appropriate use of emerging technology allows managers to transform manufacturing by optimising processes, improving product design, enhancing quality control, and contributing to overall efficiency and innovation in the industry. Simultaneously, GAI technologies facilitate predictive analytics to forecast and anticipate future demand, quality issues, and potential risks, improve a marketing strategy and identify market trends.", "venue": "Engineering Management in Production and Services", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-12-01", "journal": {"name": "Engineering Management in Production and Services", "pages": "76 - 89", "volume": "15"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2129724012", "name": "Doung Cong Doanh"}, {"authorId": "2276776926", "name": "Zden\u011bk Dufek"}, {"authorId": "123924639", "name": "J.
