Jayagiri is one of the villages in Lembang district, West Bandung regency, which experienced landslides due to heavy rainfall. High and constant rainfall causes the soil layer to become saturated and unable to withstand the water, so soil movement occurs. Identification of landslide slip field identification can be analyzed by the geoelectric method and some soil samples for laboratory tests. Four lines of DC resistivity surveys were carried out in the research area using a multichannel instrument. The result of two-dimensional modelling resistivity shows a wide zone of saturation online JG-1 to a depth of around 10 m. Based on the laboratory soil test, permeable soil with a high porosity dominated the area. Low resistivity variation values ranging from 3.79 - 93 \u03a9m correspond to the low saturation zones. The constituent rocks of the saturation zone are clay, loam, and sand.", "venue": "Journal of Physics: Conference Series", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Physics"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-11-01", "journal": {"name": "Journal of Physics: Conference Series", "volume": "2377"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "97661217", "name": "H.
