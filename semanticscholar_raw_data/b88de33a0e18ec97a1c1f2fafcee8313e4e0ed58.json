It uses sophisticated algorithms for the process of sorting through large amounts of data sets and picking out relevant information. Data mining tools predict future and behaviors, allowing businesses to make proactive, knowledge-driven decisions. With the amount of data increasing each year, more data is gathered (called Big Data) and data mining is becoming an increasingly important tool to transform this data into information. Big Data is data whose scale, diversity, and complexity require new architecture, techniques, algorithms, and analytics to manage it and extract value and hidden knowledge from it. This survey includes the information about the Data mining with big data - technologies, tools, visualization, Challenging issues and its related work.", "venue": "", "year": 2015, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "", "volume": ""}, "authors": [{"authorId": "4260380", "name": "S.
