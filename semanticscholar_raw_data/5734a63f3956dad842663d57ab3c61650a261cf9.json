{"paperId": "5734a63f3956dad842663d57ab3c61650a261cf9", "publicationVenue": null, "title": "A survey on educational process mining", "abstract": "Educational process mining (EPM) is an emerging field in educational data mining (EDM) aiming to make unexpressed knowledge explicit and to facilitate better understanding of the educational process. EPM uses log data gathered specifically from educational environments in order to discover, analyze, and provide a visual representation of the complete educational process. This paper introduces EPM and elaborates on some of the potential of this technology in the educational domain. It also describes some other relevant, related areas such as intentional mining, sequential pattern mining and graph mining. It highlights the components of an EPM framework and it describes the different challenges when handling event logs and other generic issues. It describes the data, tools, techniques and models used in EPM. In addition, the main work in this area is described and grouped by educational application domains.
