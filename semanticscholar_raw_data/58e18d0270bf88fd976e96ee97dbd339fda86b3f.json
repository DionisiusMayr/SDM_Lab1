Two key issues are the multi-dimensionality of data and the interaction of independent dimensions forming a latent output signal, as well as the representation of multi-dimensional temporal data inside of a predictive model. This paper proposes a multi-branch deep neural network approach to tackling the aforementioned problems by modelling a latent state vector representation of data windows through the use of a recurrent autoencoder branch and subsequently feeding the trained latent vector representation into a predictor branch of the model. This model is henceforth referred to as Multivariate Temporal Autoencoder (MvTAe). The framework in this paper utilizes a synthetic multivariate temporal dataset which contains dimensions that combine to create a hidden output target.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-10-07", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2010.03661"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1992661711", "name": "J.
