Our load balancer offers a single interface for clients outside the system, improving performance and response time in comparison to a node. To assurance that load balancers are not a only socket of failure, we present the inclusion of a failover method. This paper presents and estimates a total of load-balancing and failover algorithms across a number of SIP servers. This system is unable to relay requests to a server that is down. If the shattered server is invigorated, then load balancer might remain warned that requests are routed again back to server. This may be organized up with a gridlock balancer in the event of a primary failure. To preserve state statistics when the failure event occurs, the main balancer, in this paper would regularly verify the state to either the inferior load balancer via the a proper network or by using united disc. This failover system may maximize performance and reduce information failure in the event that the main load balancer fails.", "venue": "2022 2nd International Conference on Technological Advancements in Computational Sciences (ICTACS)", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-10-10", "journal": {"name": "2022 2nd International Conference on Technological Advancements in Computational Sciences (ICTACS)", "pages": "900-904"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2198499629", "name": "Muntimadugu Vijaya Kanth"}, {"authorId": "9183023", "name": "D.
