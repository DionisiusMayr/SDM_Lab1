It is a paradigm connecting everyday objects onto the Internet. However, these \u2018things' are resource-constrained in terms of computing power, storage, and communication capabilities. Hence, while securing the information flow through IoT set ups, powerful security mechanisms are not found suitable. It is important and critical to design light weight encryption methods for IoT devices. In this paper, we present a typical implementation AES standard utilizing the Xilinx ISE. The AES may be coded in software or constructed entirely through hardware for utilization in wireless networks. We use Xilinx's Project Navigator, ISE suite. The code is synthesized and implemented. To reduce the amount of hardware required, each encryption transition is simulated utilizing an iterative design process. We study a technique for integrating the WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) key of a 128-bit WGA54G with the AES encrypted data. A very secure Wi-Fi network is provided by this technology to link a number of devices.
