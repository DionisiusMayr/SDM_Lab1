Such cross-camera analytics is data and compute intensive, whose costs grow with the number of cameras and time. We present Spatula, a cost-efficient system that enables scaling cross-camera analytics on edge compute boxes to large camera networks by leveraging the spatial and temporal cross-camera correlations. While such correlations have been used in computer vision community, Spatula uses them to drastically reduce the communication and computation costs by pruning search space of a query identity (e.g., ignoring frames not correlated with the query identity\u2019s current position). Spatula provides the first system substrate on which cross-camera analytics applications can be built to efficiently harness the cross-camera correlations that are abundant in large camera deployments. Spatula reduces compute load by $8.3\\times$ on an 8-camera dataset, and by $23\\times-86\\times$ on two datasets with hundreds of cameras (simulated from real vehicle/pedestrian traces). We have also implemented Spatula on a testbed of 5 AWS DeepLens cameras.", "venue": "IFIP International Information Security Conference", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-08-23", "journal": {"name": "2020 IEEE/ACM Symposium on Edge Computing (SEC)", "pages": "110-124"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "40896248", "name": "Samvit Jain"}, {"authorId": "2108145459", "name": "Xun Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2110347912", "name": "Yuhao Zhou"}, {"authorId": "2849491", "name": "Ganesh Ananthanarayanan"}, {"authorId": "1727978", "name": "Junchen Jiang"}, {"authorId": "39596641", "name": "Yuanchao Shu"}, {"authorId": "2292948", "name": "P.
