For these models to be maximally useful, it is necessary to understand how they perform on various subgroups, especially those defined in terms of protected characteristics. In this paper we study the relationship between user demographics \u2013 focusing on gender \u2013 and depression. Considering a population of Reddit users with known genders and depression statuses, we analyze the degree to which depression predictions are subject to biases along gender lines using domain-informed classifiers. We then study our models\u2019 parameters to gain qualitative insight into the differences in posting behavior across genders.", "venue": "Workshop on Computational Linguistics and Clinical Psychology", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2021-06-01", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the Seventh Workshop on Computational Linguistics and Clinical Psychology: Improving Access"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "32344991", "name": "Elissa Sherman"}, {"authorId": "51320356", "name": "Keith Harrigian"}, {"authorId": "119589376", "name": "Carlos Alejandro Aguirre"}, {"authorId": "1478928280", "name": "Mark Dredze"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "38b6ae7e2d0ba3c827927f6ce210617047c1528a", "title": "Towards Mental Health Analysis in Social Media for Low-resourced Languages"}, {"paperId": "58b8c80923a7e5694a66b7db7f128b79031c879a", "title": "Mitigating demographic bias of machine learning models on social media"}, {"paperId": "229e43f94592fd2838f4ae0b8b1416d1b09df7be", "title": "A Systematic Review of Ethics Disclosures in Predictive Mental Health Research"}, {"paperId": "e4d0ec7f52c054d171ef8d4ec4a389e0757c6ea3", "title": "Gendered Mental Health Stigma in Masked Language Models"}, {"paperId": "b2563d102456d5140ecb4111e7f08481f720d9a4", "title": "Theories of \u201cGender\u201d in NLP Bias Research"}]}
