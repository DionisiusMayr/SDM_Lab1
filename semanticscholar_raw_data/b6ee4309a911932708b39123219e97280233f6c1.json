Existing GPU database research solutions are often focused on specific aspects in parallel algorithms and system implementations for specific features, while industry product development generally concentrates on delivering a whole system by considering its holistic performance and cost. Aiming to fill this gap between academic research and industry development, we present a comprehensive industry product study on a complete CPU/GPU HTAP system, called Ra-teupDB. We firmly believe \u201cthe art of balance\" addresses major issues in the development of RateupDB. Specifically, we consider balancing multiple factors in the software development cycle, such as the trade-off between OLAP and OLTP, the trade-off between system performance and development productivity, and balanced choices of algorithms in the product. We also present RateupDB\u2019s complete TPC-H test performance to demonstrate its significant advantages over other existing GPU DBMS products.", "venue": "Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-07-01", "journal": {"name": "Proc.
