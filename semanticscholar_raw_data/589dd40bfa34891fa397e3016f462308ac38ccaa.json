In this paper, we present an in-depth performance analysis of cold start in the serverless framework and propose HotC, a container-based runtime management framework that leverages the lightweight containers to mitigate the cold start and improve the network performance of serverless applications. HotC maintains a live container runtime pool, analyzes the user input or configuration file, and provides available runtime for immediate reuse. To precisely predict the request and efficiently manage the hot containers, we design an adaptive live container control algorithm combining the exponential smoothing model and Markov chain method. Our evaluation results show that HotC introduces negligible overhead and can efficiently improve the performance of various applications with different network traffic patterns in both cloud servers and edge devices.", "venue": "IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2021-09-01", "journal": {"name": "2021 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing (CLUSTER)", "pages": "433-443"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3446210", "name": "Kun Suo"}, {"authorId": "1856267", "name": "Junggab Son"}, {"authorId": "1778706", "name": "Dazhao Cheng"}, {"authorId": "2154941769", "name": "Wei Chen"}, {"authorId": "143890566", "name": "S.
