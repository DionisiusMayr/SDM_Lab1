In recent time, many researchers have addressed the issue. The existing solutions primarily use variations of read-write lock on the file for updating operations, or make explicit assumptions on the appearance of the particular mode of files. In this paper a novel mechanism has been proposed that neither uses a lock nor uses any such explicit assumption. The proposed solution uses Write Preference Heap Tree to ensure lock-free file consistency. This Write Preference Heap Tree instantly updates multiple copies of data spread over a distributed system. We have established the efficiency of the new approach in case of interactive system where many read and write requests are simultaneously processed.", "venue": "2019 Second International Conference on Advanced Computational and Communication Paradigms (ICACCP)", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2019-02-01", "journal": {"name": "2019 Second International Conference on Advanced Computational and Communication Paradigms (ICACCP)", "pages": "1-6"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1390000521", "name": "Aliva Bakshi"}, {"authorId": "2113355924", "name": "Satyaki Chatterjee"}, {"authorId": "1721188", "name": "N.
