We present IntegratedML, an embedded database capability for machine learning. This paper describes how IntegratedML provides developers with access to state-of-the-art machine learning platforms using intuitive SQL syntax. Its embedded feature extraction and algorithm selection enable fully automated model building, while model inferencing is exposed through a simple scalar function. The novelty of IntegratedML is in the deep integration into the embedding relational engine, which hides pipeline complexity from the user and guarantees high efficiencies, both at train and inference time.", "venue": "DEEM@SIGMOD", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-06-14", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the Fourth International Workshop on Data Management for End-to-End Machine Learning"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "40485937", "name": "Benjamin De Boe"}, {"authorId": "153105335", "name": "Thomas R.
