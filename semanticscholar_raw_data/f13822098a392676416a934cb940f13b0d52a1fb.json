Recording such a global snapshot requires long chain synchronization of pipelined tasks, adversely affecting the system\u2019s performance. To improve performance, herein a fine-tailored p artial s napshot a lgorithm f or D SPSs is proposed to create separated snapshot regions from a subset of the global checkpointing mechanism. The synchronization space of the snapshotting process can be narrowed into several independently executed sub-snapshots. The frequency of checkpoint intervals varies by region. To minimize the impact on the whole system, regions containing critical tasks have a higher frequency to provide timely restore points, while those with lightweight tasks can be detached to a different region. As a proof of concept, we present RegSnap implemented on top of Apache Flink. In general, our scheme outperforms existing global snapshots in terms of the number of affected tasks, checkpoint duration, and recovery latency.", "venue": "2022 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-12-17", "journal": {"name": "2022 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "pages": "3374-3382"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2203135428", "name": "Takdir"}, {"authorId": "1687013", "name": "H.
