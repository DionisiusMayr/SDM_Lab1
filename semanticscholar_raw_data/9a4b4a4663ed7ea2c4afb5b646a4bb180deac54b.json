However, the way open data is published raises questions such as the origin and authorship of the data. Making the provenance of this data provides information on how, when, and why the data was created and published. Given this scenario, we consider that the combination of data and its origin enriches the traceability of the data, exposing the methods and agents involved in its creation, and promoting the possibility of reproducibility of this data. This paper presents a data provenance technology solution to enhance public open government data publishing by employing an information architecture that can provide the provenance of open government public data using PROV-DM and a graph database. The implementation of a proposed information architecture for collecting, managing, storing and publication of the provenance of the textit workflow for publication of linked open government data is presented as a case study. This provenance publication, collected from the execution of the publication of a set of data collected from UnB\u2019s information systems, is carried out on the CKAN platform together with the linked data published on the platform.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2020-01-30", "journal": {"name": "", "volume": ""}, "authors": [{"authorId": "145901398", "name": "R.
