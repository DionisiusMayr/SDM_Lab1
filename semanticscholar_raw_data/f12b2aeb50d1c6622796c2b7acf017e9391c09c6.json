Upon sensing of certain stimuli, inflammasomes typically activate inflammatory caspases that promote the production and release of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2, IL-1\u03b1, and IL-18 and induce a type of inflammatory cell death known as \u201cpyroptosis\u201d. Pyroptosis is an important form of regulated cell death executed by gasdermin proteins, which is largely different from apoptosis and necrosis. Recently, several signaling pathways driving pyroptotic cell death, including canonical and noncanonical inflammasome activation, as well as caspase-3-dependent pathways, have been reported. While much evidence exists that pyroptosis is involved in the development of several inflammatory diseases, its contribution to inflammasome-related disorders (IRDs) has not been fully clarified. This article reviews molecular mechanisms leading to pyroptosis, and attempts to provide evidence for its possible role in inflammasome-related disorders, including NLR pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome disease, NLR containing a caspase recruitment domain 4 (NLRC4) inflammasome disease, and pyrin inflammasome disease. Although the specific mechanism needs further investigations, these studies have uncovered the role of pyroptosis in inflammasome-related disorders and may open new avenues for future therapeutic interventions.", "venue": "International Journal of Molecular Sciences", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-09-01", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Molecular Sciences", "volume": "23"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2107983643", "name": "Jiajia Zhang"}, {"authorId": "145901811", "name": "S.
