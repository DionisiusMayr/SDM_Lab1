Recent studies show that graph-based ANN methods often outperform other types of ANN algorithms. For typical graph-based methods, the searching algorithm is executed iteratively and the execution dependency prohibits GPU adaptations. In this paper, we present a novel framework that decouples the searching on graph algorithm into 3 stages, in order to parallel the performance-crucial distance computation. Furthermore, to obtain better parallelism on GPU, we propose novel ANN-specific optimization methods that eliminate dynamic GPU memory allocations and trade computations for less GPU memory consumption. The proposed system is empirically compared against HNSW\u2013the state-of-the-art ANN method on CPU\u2013and Faiss\u2013the popular GPU-accelerated ANN platform\u2013on 6 datasets. The results confirm the effectiveness: SONG has around 50-180x speedup compared with single-thread HNSW, while it substantially outperforms Faiss.", "venue": "IEEE International Conference on Data
