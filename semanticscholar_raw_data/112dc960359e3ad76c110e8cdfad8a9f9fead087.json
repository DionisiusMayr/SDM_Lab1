Although efficient and accurate, the latest video analytic systems have not supported analytics beyond selection and aggregation queries. In data analytics, Top-K is a very important analytical operation that enables analysts to focus on the most important entities. In this demonstration, we present Everest, the first system that supports efficient and accurate Top-K video analytics. Everest ranks and identifies the most interesting frames/clips from videos with probabilistic guarantees. Furthermore, it supports user-defined functions to rank frames/clips based on different semantics using different deep vision models. Everest leverages techniques from computer vision, uncertain databases, and Top-K query processing to return results quickly.", "venue": "SIGMOD Conference", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-06-10", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 2022 International Conference on Management of Data"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "51252562", "name": "Ziliang Lai"}, {"authorId": "2768964", "name": "Chris Liu"}, {"authorId": "2118642200", "name": "Chenxia Han"}, {"authorId": "2110149896", "name": "Pengfei Zhang"}, {"authorId": "145373095", "name": "Eric Lo"}, {"authorId": "2064074042", "name": "Ben Kao"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "eeab466d688b94133950788eaf8d1bf33bf037cb", "title": "Zelda: Video Analytics using Vision-Language Models"}]}
