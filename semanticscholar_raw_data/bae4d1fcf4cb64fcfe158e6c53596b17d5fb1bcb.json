A series of approaches based on this framework achieved remarkable success on various TOD benchmarks. However, we argue that the current TOD benchmarks are limited to surrogate real-world scenarios and that the current TOD models are still a long way to cover the scenarios. In this position paper, we first identify current status and limitations of SF-TOD systems. After that, we explore the WebTOD framework, the alternative direction for building a scalable TOD system when a web/mobile interface is available. In WebTOD, the dialogue system learns how to understand the web/mobile interface that the human agent interacts with, powered by a large-scale language model.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-12-20", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2212.10504"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3226948", "name": "Sang-Woo Lee"}, {"authorId": "2829848", "name": "Sungdong Kim"}, {"authorId": "17733849", "name": "Donghyeon Ko"}, {"authorId": "1405505217", "name": "Dong-hyun Ham"}, {"authorId": "145424106", "name": "Youngki Hong"}, {"authorId": "22448617", "name": "Shin Ah Oh"}, {"authorId": "94185397", "name": "Hyunhoon Jung"}, {"authorId": "2197078471", "name": "Wangkyo Jung"}, {"authorId": "1979489", "name": "Kyunghyun Cho"}, {"authorId": "10469987", "name": "Donghyun Kwak"}, {"authorId": "7458033", "name": "H.
