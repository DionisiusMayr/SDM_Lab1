Evidence indicates correlations between DPs and obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. However, little is known on how DP influences DBM. This mini-review examined DP-DBM relationship among adults along with different DP approaches and DBM definitions. A structured search of peer-reviewed articles was performed from Web of Science. Keywords related to \u201cdietary patterns,\u201d \u201cdouble burden of malnutrition,\u201d and \u201cadults\u201d were used. A total of 133 studies were included. Results showed that factor analysis was the predominant DP analysis method. DBM was frequently assessed at the national level and defined as the coexistence of overweight/obesity and underweight. From the 133 studies, only four articles investigated DP-DBM association and suggested that healthier DPs positively improved DBM. Significant knowledge gaps remain, including (1) application of a combination of DP approaches, (2) evaluation of individual-level and household-level DBM, and (3) inconsistency of micronutrient deficiencies and non-communicable disease indicators in DBM definition. This review revealed paucity of studies on the nexus of DPs and DBM. Future research is imperative to establish evidence on the link between food patterns and multiple burdens of malnutrition.", "venue": "Asia-Pacific journal of public health", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-07-29", "journal": {"name": "Asia Pacific Journal of Public Health", "pages": "7 - 13", "volume": "35"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2120827413", "name": "Aileen R. de Juras"}, {"authorId": "1811215", "name": "Susan C.
