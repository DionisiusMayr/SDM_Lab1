Despite the growing importance of this API, there is a lack of benchmarks specifically targeting stream-based applications. Instead of designing and implementing new ad-hoc workloads for the Java Stream API, we propose to automatically translate existing data-processing workloads. To this end, we present S2S, an automatic benchmark generator for the Java Stream API. S2S is a SQL query compiler that converts existing workloads designed for relational databases to stream-based code. We use S2S to generate BSS, the first benchmark suite for the Java Stream API.", "venue": "International Conference on Generative Programming: Concepts and Experiences", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book"], "publicationDate": "2022-11-29", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 21st ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Generative Programming: Concepts and Experiences"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "51044752", "name": "F.
