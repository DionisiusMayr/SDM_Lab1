In contrast, platform providers take care of resource management and administration. As FaaS users are billed based on the execution of the functions, platform providers have a natural incentive not to keep idle resources running at the platform's expense. However, this strategy may lead to the cold start issue, in which the execution of a function is delayed because there is no ready resource to host the execution. Cold starts can take hundreds of milliseconds to seconds and have been a prohibitive and painful disadvantage for some applications. This work describes and evaluates a technique to start functions, which restores snapshots from previously executed function processes. We developed a prototype of this technique based on the CRIU process checkpoint/restore Linux tool. We evaluate this prototype by running experiments that compare its start-up time against the standard Unix process creation/start-up procedure. We analyze the following three functions: i) a \"do-nothing\" function, ii) an Image Resizer function, and iii) a function that renders Markdown files. The results attained indicate that the technique can improve the start-up time of function replicas by 40% (in the worst case of a \"do-nothing\" function) and up to 71% for the Image Resizer one. Further analysis indicates that the runtime initialization is a key factor, and we confirmed it by performing a sensitivity analysis based on synthetically generated functions of different code sizes. These experiments demonstrate that it is critical to decide when to create a snapshot of a function. When one creates the snapshots of warm functions, the speed-up achieved by the prebaking technique is even higher: the speed-up increases from 127.45% to 403.96%, for a small, synthetic function; and for a bigger, synthetic function, this ratio increases from 121.07% to 1932.49%.", "venue": "International Middleware Conference", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-12-07", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 21st International Middleware Conference"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2110867199", "name": "Paulo Silva"}, {"authorId": "2189255", "name": "Daniel Fireman"}, {"authorId": "2256708", "name": "T.
