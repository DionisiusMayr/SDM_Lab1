However, in the case where such feedback is sparse or uninformative, such approaches may result in poor performance. Derivative-free approaches such as Bayesian Optimization mitigate the dependency on the quality of gradient feedback, but are known to scale poorly in the high-dimension setting of complex decision making systems. This problem is exacerbated if the system requires interactions between several actors cooperating to accomplish a shared goal. To address the dimensionality challenge, we propose a compact multi-layered architecture modeling the dynamics of actor interactions through the concept of role. We introduce Hessian-aware Bayesian Optimization to efficiently optimize the multi-layered architecture parameterized by a large number of parameters, and give the first improved regret bound in additive high-dimensional Bayesian Optimization since Mutny&Krause (2018). Our approach shows strong empirical results under malformed or sparse reward.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-08-01", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2308.00629"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "4791746", "name": "Mohit Rajpal"}, {"authorId": "2226261402", "name": "Lac Gia Tran"}, {"authorId": "72095066", "name": "Yehong Zhang"}, {"authorId": "40222533", "name": "B.
