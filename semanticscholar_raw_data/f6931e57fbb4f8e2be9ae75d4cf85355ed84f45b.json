While this technology can be used for different types of problems to be solved, optimal parameters of modular enumeration operating mode are known only in the case of solving discrete optimization problems with Boolean variables. The paper contains proofs of two theorems, permitting modular enumeration optimal operating mode determination in general case. The paper also contains examples of solution by modular enumeration optimal organization related to the two problems i. e. the search for the numerical value of multiple integral and that for a globally optimal solution to an extreme problem with Boolean variables, the last being based on knapsack problem solution.", "venue": "International Journal of Applied Mathematics, Computational Science and Systems Engineering", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-11-24", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Applied Mathematics, Computational Science and Systems Engineering"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "10694599", "name": "V.
