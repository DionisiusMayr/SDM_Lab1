Various studies have been conducted involving the development of artificial intelligence, machine learning technology, and big data frameworks. The analysis of smart mobility big data is essential and helps to address problems that arise as society faces increased future mobility. In this paper, we analyze application issues such as personal information leakage and data visualization due to increased data exchange in detail, as well as approaches focusing on analyses exploiting machine learning and architecture research exploiting big data frameworks, such as Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark, and Apache Kafka. Finally, future research directions and open challenges are discussed.", "venue": "Applied Sciences", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-06-17", "journal": {"name": "Applied Sciences"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2155231610", "name": "DoHoon Lee"}, {"authorId": "143869061", "name": "David Camacho"}, {"authorId": "145888300", "name": "Jason J.
