It is widely considered that many fields of science are undergoing a reproducibility crisis. This has led to the publications of various guidelines in order to improve research reproducibility. This didactic chapter intends at being an introduction to reproducibility for researchers in the field of machine learning for medical imaging. We first distinguish between different types of reproducibility. For each of them, we aim at defining it, at describing the requirements to achieve it and at discussing its utility. The chapter ends with a discussion on the benefits of reproducibility and with a plea for a non-dogmatic approach to this concept and its implementation in research practice.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Biology", "Mathematics"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-09-12", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2209.05097"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2333839", "name": "O.
