For such service chains, a late response may be worthless or cause failures. Previous works proposed to prevent late responses by trading computation time for result quality, depending on the available resources. However, determining the Quality of Result (QoR) for each operation in a service chain ahead of time, as is the state of the art, cannot prevent requests that are currently processing from being late if resource availability changes, e.g., due to resource sharing at inelastic Edge sites. Therefore, we present a framework to control the QoR online by replanning QoR values whenever resource changes are detected.", "venue": "IFIP International Information Security Conference", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-12-06", "journal": {"name": "2023 IEEE/ACM Symposium on Edge Computing (SEC)", "pages": "255-257"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2283153969", "name": "Uwe Gropengie\u00dfer"}, {"authorId": "2268676", "name": "Florian Brandherm"}, {"authorId": "2270533626", "name": "Max M\u00fchlh\u00e4user"}], "citations": []}
