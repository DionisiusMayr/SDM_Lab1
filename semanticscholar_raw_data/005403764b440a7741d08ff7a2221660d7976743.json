However, few studies have focussed on the applications of the latest popular machine learning models in collapse susceptibility assessment (CSA). This paper proposes a 3S (RS, GPS and GIS) technology-based support vector machine (SVM) to map collapse susceptibility in the Nantian area of China. The 3S technology-based back-propagation neural network (BPNN) and radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) models are also proposed for comparison. First, 44 recorded collapses are identified through field investigation, and fourteen collapse-related causal factors are acquired using 3S technology. Second, among these recorded collapses and randomly selected \u2018non-collapses\u2019, 70% of the collapse and non-collapse grid cells are used to train the three models, while the remaining 30% are used to test the models. Third, the collapse susceptibility maps of the Nantian area are produced using the three models. Finally, the prediction accuracies of these models are evaluated. The results indicate that the SVM model has the highest prediction accuracy, while the RBFNN model has the lowest prediction accuracy for CSA. In addition, the distribution characteristics of collapse susceptibility in the Nantian area are produced well by all three models.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2020-01-01", "journal": {"name": "Geomatics, Natural Hazards and Risk", "pages": "510 - 534", "volume": "11"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "30504085", "name": "Yuanyao Li"}, {"authorId": "2053802956", "name": "Yifan Sheng"}, {"authorId": "47407343", "name": "B.
