In this paper, we propose a novel histogram-based data synopsis called PairwiseHist that uses recursive hypothesis testing to ensure accurate histograms and can be built on top of data compressed using Generalized Deduplication (GD). We thus show that GD data compression can contribute to AQP. Compared to state-of-the-art AQP approaches, PairwiseHist achieves better performance across all key metrics, including 2.6$ \\times $ higher accuracy, 3.5$ \\times $ lower latency, 24$ \\times $ smaller synopses and 1.5--4$ \\times $ faster construction time.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-01-22", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2401.12018"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "144764649", "name": "Aaron Hurst"}, {"authorId": "9296846", "name": "D.
