Hence, the spatial data processing system has become an important field of research. Though the traditional relational database systems provide spatial functionality (such as, PostgreSQL with PostGIS), due to the lack of parallelism and I/O bottleneck, these systems are not efficient to run compute-intensive spatial queries on large datasets. In recent times a number of big spatial data systems have been proposed by researchers around the world. These systems can be roughly categorized into disk-based systems over Apache Hadoop and inmemory systems based on Apache Spark. The available features supported by these systems vary widely. However, there has not been any comprehensive evaluation study of these systems in terms of performance, scalability, and functionality. In order to address this need, this thesis proposes a benchmark to evaluate big spatial data systems. It intends to investigate the present status of the big spatial data systems by conducting a comprehensive feature", "venue": "", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2109951131", "name": "M.
