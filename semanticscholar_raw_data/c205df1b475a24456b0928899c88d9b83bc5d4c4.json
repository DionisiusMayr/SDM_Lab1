Methods Patients randomised to ustekinumab every 12 weeks [q12w] or every 8 weeks [q8w] at maintenance baseline [N = 348] and randomised ustekinumab-treated patients in the LTE [N = 284] were evaluated. Symptomatic remission [Mayo stool frequency = 0/1, rectal bleeding = 0] was assessed. Safety included all LTE patients [N = 188 placebo and N = 457 ustekinumab]. Results Among patients randomised to the ustekinumab q12w and q8w groups at maintenance baseline, 54.1% and 56.3% achieved symptomatic remission at Week 152, respectively. Overall, 20% of patients discontinued ustekinumab, 10% of biologic-na\u00efve and 30% of biologic-exposed patients. Among patients in symptomatic remission at Year 3, 94.6% and 98.0% of patients were also corticosteroid free, respectively. Corticosteroid-free symptomatic remission rates in the ustekinumab q12w and q8w groups were 51.2% and 55.1% at Week 152, respectively. Remission rates were higher for biologic-na\u00efve patients than for those with a history of biologic failure. Biochemical evidence of response was demonstrated by stable, decreased C-reactive protein and faecal calprotectin measurements over 3 years. From Weeks 96 to 156, no deaths, major adverse cardiovascular events, or tuberculosis occurred. Nasopharyngitis, ulcerative colitis, and upper respiratory tract infection were most frequently reported. One ustekinumab-treated patient with a history of basal cell carcinoma [BCC] reported two BCCs. One patient in the q8w ustekinumab group, who was receiving concomitant 6-mercaptopurine, experienced serious adverse events of neutropenic sepsis and oral herpes. Conclusions Efficacy of ustekinumab in patients with ulcerative colitis was confirmed through 3 years. No new safety signals were observed.", "venue": "Journal of Crohn's & Colitis", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-03-03", "journal": {"name": "Journal of Crohn's & Colitis", "pages": "1222 - 1234", "volume": "16"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "40192843", "name": "M.
