Software testing is the process of executing a program with finding bugs, reduce bugs and software cost. Effective testing gives quality software. The aim is to study the overall description of QTP tool and comparison with other tools. For the development science and technology, computer has faced lots of difficulties. The automated testing solved the problem much better. Functionality, performance growth and faster time to market today are having a huge competition between software industries. For achieving success the key point for organizations is how to keep quality of product under pressure.", "venue": "2018 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communication Control and Networking (ICACCCN)", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2018-10-01", "journal": {"name": "2018 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communication Control and Networking (ICACCCN)", "pages": "526-532"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3399971", "name": "R.
