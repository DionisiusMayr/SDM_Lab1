Nonetheless, methods of online data collection are riddled with ethical and methodological challenges that researchers must consider if they want to adopt good practices when collecting and analyzing online data. Drawing from our primary research project, where we collected passive online data on Reddit, we explore and detail the steps that researchers must consider before collecting online data: (1) planning online data collection; (2) ethical considerations; and (3) data collection. We also discuss two atypical questions that researchers should also consider: (1) how to handle deleted user-generated content; and (2) how to quote user-generated content. Moving on from the dichotomous discussion between what is public and private data, we present recommendations for good practices when collecting and analyzing qualitative online data.", "venue": "Research Ethics", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-11-28", "journal": {"name": "Research Ethics"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2114525642", "name": "Tiago Rocha-Silva"}, {"authorId": "2269188431", "name": "Concei\u00e7\u00e3o Nogueira"}, {"authorId": "2269425781", "name": "Liliana Rodrigues"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "5bf9bc9373282a7d01dbfce6a3046b8d9174893e", "title": "G-VARS : Towards Personalized Risk Assessments by Analyzing Gun Violence Susceptibility with Personal Knowledge Graphs"}]}
