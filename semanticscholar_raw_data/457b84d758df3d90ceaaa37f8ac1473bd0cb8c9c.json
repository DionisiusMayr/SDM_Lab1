One of the main contributions of this paper is to propose a general classification of this problem, framed in the general context of the OWFs design and optimization (OWiFDO). The classification encompasses two complementary aspects. First, the optimum sizing of electrical cables, with the three main approaches used nowadays, static-rated sizing, dynamic load cycle profile, and dynamic full time series, is conceptually analyzed and compared. The latest techniques and advances are described, along with the presentation of potential research areas not thoroughly addressed today, such as dynamic cable rating, and cable\u2019s lifetime estimation under time-varying conditions. Second, the network optimization of large OWFs is thoroughly presented, dividing the problem with a bottom\u2013top approach: cable layout of the collection system, wind turbines (WTs) allocation to offshore substations (OSSs), number and location of OSSs, and interconnection between OSSs and onshore connection points (OCPs). A comparison among different methods is performed, taking into consideration the main engineering constraints. Global optimization, specifically, binary programming (BIP) or mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), is envisaged as the best way to tackle this topic. The full combinatorial problem is found to be better addressed following a top\u2013bottom approach, combining exact formulations with high-level heuristics, or holistically with evolutionary algorithms.", "venue": "IEEE Access", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2019-07-01", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Access", "pages": "85796-85811", "volume": "7"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1401970065", "name": "J.
