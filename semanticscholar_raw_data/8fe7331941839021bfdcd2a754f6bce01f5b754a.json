Failure of power equipment will not only affect economic development, but also seriously affect people's lives.With the development of the times, the demand for electric energy is increasing, and the power system is becoming increasingly complex. Traditional technology can no longer meet its needs. In the past, the spatial geometric relationship of power equipment is difficult to display, and the specific location of power equipment cannot be directly obtained. In order to solve the above problems, This paper presents a visualization technology of power equipment based on Web GIS. By inputting the longitude and latitude coordinates of the power equipment, the specific location of the power equipment on the map and the relationship between the equipment can be displayed. Secondly, 3D point cloud data is added to the technical solution to realize 3D visualization of power equipment. 3D point cloud data can be used to display the spatial geometric relationship and environment of power equipment to the maximum extent.", "venue": "2023 3rd Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications Technology and Computer Science (ACCTCS)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-02-01", "journal": {"name": "2023 3rd Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications Technology and Computer Science (ACCTCS)", "pages": "347-351"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2072589766", "name": "Huang Qi"}, {"authorId": "2220716634", "name": "Chang Feng"}], "citations": []}
