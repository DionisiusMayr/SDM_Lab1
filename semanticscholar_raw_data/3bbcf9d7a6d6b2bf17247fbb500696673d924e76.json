Spatial AI, when implemented, allows for the prediction of the state of the world and the generation of the behavior of the group of agents. A digital twin of a dynamic collective agent environment, including autonomous groups of agents, serves as a basis for simulating various situations and actions. As a means of implementing this architecture, the SSCP Model is proposed, which is a framework for artificial intelligence that can manage agents existing within an arbitrary space. By unifying the agents' communication style, spatial intelligence, spatial representation, and environmental knowledge, Spatial AI provides a Common Ground for controlling diverse groups of AI agents.", "venue": "2023 IEEE International Smart Cities Conference (ISC2)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-09-24", "journal": {"name": "2023 IEEE International Smart Cities Conference (ISC2)", "pages": "1-7"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2264229126", "name": "Youichiro Miyake"}, {"authorId": "2264448857", "name": "Keisuke Toyoda"}, {"authorId": "2266472378", "name": "Takashi Kasuya"}, {"authorId": "2264461766", "name": "Akihiko Hyodo"}, {"authorId": "2264462256", "name": "Masashi Seiki"}], "citations": []}
