In particular, they are partially reconfigurable at runtime, which allows for the adaptation to a variety of queries. Reconfiguration itself, however, takes some time. This paper presents optimizations based on query sequences, which reduce the impact of the reconfigurations. Knowledge of upcoming queries is used to avoid reconfiguration overhead. We evaluate our optimizations with a calibrated model. Improvements in execution time of up to 28% can be obtained even with sequences of only two queries.", "venue": "International Workshop on Data Management on New Hardware", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book"], "publicationDate": "2020-05-01", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 16th International Workshop on Data Management on New Hardware"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2052084520", "name": "Lekshmi Beena Gopalakrishnan Nair"}, {"authorId": "144554777", "name": "Andreas Becher"}, {"authorId": "1399432410", "name": "K.
