Human settlements can be considered complex systems and when disaster strikes, the degree of complexity is amplified exponentially. Thus, traditional management systems, based on classical paradigms, may be completely ineffective. Therefore, new management approaches are needed to implement safety, resilience and sustainability. In this context, this paper illustrates a research where Digital Twin (DT) is exploited as an adaptive system for the built environment, as a support to optimize post-disaster reconstruction processes with a focus on reactive security management, in order to implement resilience in a smart city perspective. Following this vision, the research project aims to realise a first extended framework enabling the implementation of digital twins in the built environment, then defining some DT demonstrators in the laboratory.", "venue": "2023 IEEE International Workshop on Metrology for Living Environment (MetroLivEnv)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2023-05-29", "journal": {"name": "2023 IEEE International Workshop on Metrology for Living Environment (MetroLivEnv)", "pages": "113-117"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "96952775", "name": "M.
