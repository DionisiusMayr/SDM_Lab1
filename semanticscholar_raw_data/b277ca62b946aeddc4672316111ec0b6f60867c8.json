However, the K-means algorithm has its inherent drawbacks. It is hard for the K-means algorithm to deal well with some complex clustering cases where there are too many real clusters or non-convex clusters. In this paper, a novel clustering optimization method is presented to accomplish the clustering process in Un-LDA and the resulting method can be named Un-LDA(CD). Specifically, instead of the K-means algorithm, an elaborately designed coordinate descent algorithm is adopted to obtain the clusters after the objective function goes through a series of simple but deft equivalent conversions. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that the coordinate descent clustering solution for Un-LDA can outperform the original K-means based solution on the tested data sets especially those complex data sets with a pretty large number of real clusters.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-04-01", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering", "pages": "3444-3457", "volume": "35"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2140026688", "name": "Quan Wang"}, {"authorId": "2148956094", "name": "Fei Wang"}, {"authorId": "2056627941", "name": "Fuji Ren"}, {"authorId": "7718686", "name": "Zhongheng Li"}, {"authorId": "144962210", "name": "F.
