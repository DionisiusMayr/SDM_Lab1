This means that the developer tunes hundreds of tuning parameters directly in the query source code (or via terminal interface), but the system assumes the same configuration to every running job. The lurking problem is that the system allocates computing resources uniformly to every running job, even if they present different consumption needs (after all the tuning setup is the same). In this paper, we demonstrate that such uniform allocation of resources drives the query to inefficient performance. We claim that applying a non-uniform allocation method to define a customized tuning setup for each job can outperform the uniform allocation. Ultimately, we demonstrate that searching for specific tuning setup is an optimization problem with polynomial cost.", "venue": "Alberto Mendelzon Workshop on Foundations of Data Management", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "", "volume": ""}, "authors": [{"authorId": "7698221", "name": "Edson Ramiro Lucas Filho"}, {"authorId": "147938009", "name": "R.
