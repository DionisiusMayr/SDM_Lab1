In this work, we use characteristics of online communities and authors \u2014 the context of how and where content is posted \u2014 to explain the performance of a neural network deception detection model and identify sub-populations who are disproportionately affected by model accuracy or failure. We examine who is posting the content, and where the content is posted to. We find that while author characteristics are better predictors of deceptive content than community characteristics, both characteristics are strongly correlated with model performance. Traditional performance metrics such as F1 score may fail to capture poor model performance on isolated sub-populations such as specific authors, and as such, more nuanced evaluation of deception detection models is critical.", "venue": "NLP4IF", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-04-27", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2104.13490"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "49687960", "name": "Galen Cassebeer Weld"}, {"authorId": "27558137", "name": "Ellyn Ayton"}, {"authorId": "1745524", "name": "Tim Althoff"}, {"authorId": "2046282", "name": "M.
