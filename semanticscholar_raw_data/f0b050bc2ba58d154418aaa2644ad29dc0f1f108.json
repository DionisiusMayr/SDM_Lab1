Despite the success of these methods, their large memory and strong computational requirements hinder their application on resource restricted devices. Therefore, this paper introduces GenDistiller, a novel knowledge distillation framework to distill hidden representations from teacher network based on generative language model. The generative structure enables the proposed model to generate the target teacher hidden layers autoregressively, considering the interactions between hidden layers without instroducing additional inputs. A two-dimensional attention mechanism is implemented to ensure the causality of hidden layers, while preserving bidirectional attention in the time dimension. Experiments reveal the advantage of the generative distiller over the baseline system that predicts the hidden layers of teacher network directly without a generatvie model.", "venue": "", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2023-10-20", "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2118544111", "name": "Yingying Gao"}, {"authorId": "2261184944", "name": "Shilei Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2261083745", "name": "Zihao Cui"}, {"authorId": "2261293389", "name": "Yanhan Xu"}, {"authorId": "2261084697", "name": "Chao Deng"}, {"authorId": "2144086249", "name": "Junlan Feng"}], "citations": []}
