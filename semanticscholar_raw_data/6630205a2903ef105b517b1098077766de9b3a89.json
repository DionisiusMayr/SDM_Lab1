Reference-guided DNA assembly involves aligning many read sequences against candidate locations in a long reference genome. To reduce the computational load of this alignment, candidate locations can be pre-filtered using simpler alignment algorithms like edit distance. Prior work has explored accelerating filtering on simulated compute-in-DRAM, due to the massive parallelism of compute-in-memory architectures. In this paper, we present work-in-progress on accelerating filtering using a commercial compute-in-SRAM accelerator. We leverage the recently released Gemini accelerator platform from GSI Technology, which is the first, to our knowledge, commercial-scale compute-in-SRAM system. We accelerate the Myers' bit-parallel edit distance algorithm, producing average speedups of 14.1x over single-core CPU performance. Individual query/candidate alignments produce speedups of up to 24.1x. These early results suggest this novel architecture is well-suited to accelerating the filtering step of sequence-to-sequence DNA alignment.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Biology"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-01-22", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2401.11685"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2186133126", "name": "Courtney Golden"}, {"authorId": "2274659588", "name": "Dan Ilan"}, {"authorId": "2186131701", "name": "Nick Cebry"}, {"authorId": "2274667065", "name": "Christopher Batten"}], "citations": []}
