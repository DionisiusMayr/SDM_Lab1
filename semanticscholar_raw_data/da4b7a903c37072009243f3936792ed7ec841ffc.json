Such analytical queries compute aggregates over multiple groupings of data, resulting in query plans with complex grouping-aggregation constraints. In the context of an RDF analytical query, each such grouping maps to a graph pattern subquery with multiple join operations, and related groups often result in overlapping graph patterns within the same query. In this paper, we propose a holistic approach to optimize RDF analytical queries by refactoring queries to achieve shared execution of common subexpressions that enables parallel evaluation of groupings as well as aggregations. Such a rewriting enables shorter execution workflows, particularly beneficial for scale-out processing on distributed Cloud systems with multiple I/O phases. Experiments on real-world and synthetic benchmarks confirm that such a rewriting can achieve more efficient execution plans when compared to relational-style SPARQL query plans executed on popular Cloud systems.", "venue": "2015 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "year": 2015, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2015-10-29", "journal": {"name": "2015 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "pages": "32-37"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "145207833", "name": "P.
