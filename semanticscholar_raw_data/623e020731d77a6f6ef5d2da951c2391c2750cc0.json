Load balancing is a set of techniques used to improve resource utilization and affect the overall performance of the cloud computing platform. In this paper, comparative study is performed for existing Round Robin algorithm, throttled algorithm and Equally Spread Current Execution Load algorithm on the basis of following metrics: overall response time, data center processing time, data center request servicing times and the overall processing cost.", "venue": "International Conference on Information and Software Technologies", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-06-04", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Information Systems and Technologies"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1405687293", "name": "Mostefa Hamdani"}, {"authorId": "2542329", "name": "Youcef Aklouf"}, {"authorId": "1404335625", "name": "Hichem Chaalal"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "cf60abe9ec4d9a6a3856c06b9fcc8f121b997ac1", "title": "Static and dynamic load balancing algorithms most commonly used in different environments"}]}
