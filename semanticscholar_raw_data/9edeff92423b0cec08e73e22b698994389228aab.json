The platform provides an opportunity to share news and discuss a variety of topics including specialty choice and residency applications. In this study we analyze posts on the subreddit r/medicalschool with the aim of understanding how medical students perceive radiology as a career and what factors influence their decision to pursue radiology. Reddit posts to were collected from the r/medicalschool subreddit (2009-2022) and a randomized sample of the corpus was labeled to yield 2000 posts that discussed radiology as career and 1542 posts not discussing radiology. Sentiment analysis of the labeled corpus was conducted using the SiEBRT RoBERTa transformer sentiment pipeline, a machine trained English language text analyzer. Student's t-test was used to compare sentiment of posts discussing radiology to nonradiology posts by career keywords. Posts discussing radiology as a career had an overall positive sentiment but were lower than nonradiology posts' sentiment (p<.001). Key words associated with a positive sentiment score were \"procedure\", \"lifestyle\", \"income\", \"fit\", \"personality\", \"anatomy\", \"tech\", \"physics\", \"research,\" and \"match.\" Negative sentiment score included key words \"AI\", \"burnout\", \"culture\", \"job market\", \"midlevel\", \"sue\", \"teleradiology.\" \"Procedures\" had the most positive sentiment score, while \"AI\" had the most negative score. Our study highlights aspects of radiology as a career that are discussed positively and negatively on Reddit. These posts are read by medical students around the world and may influence their choice of specialty.", "venue": "Current problems in diagnostic radiology", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-04-01", "journal": {"name": "Current problems in diagnostic radiology"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2214616004", "name": "Muhammad Y.
