To maintain cost-efficiency in such environments, understanding the characteristics and estimating the overheads of a distributed matrix multiplication task that is a core computation kernel in many machine learning algorithms are essential. This article aims to propose a Matrix Multiplication Performance Estimator on Cloud (MPEC) algorithm. The proposed algorithm predicts the latency incurred when executing distributed matrix multiplication tasks of various input sizes and shapes with diverse instance types and a different number of worker nodes on cloud computing environments. To achieve this goal, we first analyze the characteristics of distributed matrix multiplication tasks. With characteristics generated from qualitative analysis, we propose to apply an ensemble of non-linear regression algorithm to predict the execution time of arbitrary matrix multiplication tasks. Thorough experimental results reveal that the proposed algorithm demonstrates higher accuracy than a state-of-the-art machine learning task performance estimation engine, Ernest, by decreasing the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) in half.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2019-10-30", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing", "pages": "521-538", "volume": "10"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "151485854", "name": "Jeongchul Kim"}, {"authorId": "25132893", "name": "Myungjun Son"}, {"authorId": "92055064", "name": "Kyungyong Lee"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "6764cde98b09b35ed212e4bd01483176eac2787f", "title": "Predicting the Performance-Cost Trade-off of Applications Across Multiple Systems"}, {"paperId": "8f4576fb96c056ad7d68f8470895cf66ae336c46", "title": "Dense or Sparse : Elastic SPMM Implementation for Optimal Big-Data Processing"}, {"paperId": "62acb0d0907df7e054f1d3f6fc24436a9ae4a92a", "title": "Context-Aware Routing in Fog Computing Systems"}, {"paperId": "8d093502aeb51a2b12fef26ce70b3bbbe5096fe4", "title": "An Improved LightGBM Job Running Status Prediction Algorithm Integrating Combinatorial Feature Selection and Bayesian Hyperparameter Optimization on Spark"}, {"paperId": "82eed40bf760a1fac01c99281ab86a6ce185a72e", "title": "PROFET: PROFiling-based CNN Training Latency ProphET for GPU Cloud Instances"}, {"paperId": "3e303a35ab6f5e852c11126104150f29fe98ffb3", "title": "S-MPEC: Sparse Matrix Multiplication Performance Estimator on a Cloud Environment"}, {"paperId": "66ad3adac587ea431bdd5a7ef93580df72065577", "title": "Straggler Mitigation through Unequal Error Protection for Distributed Approximate Matrix Multiplication"}, {"paperId": "21ec9e5dafbf30a0601f91f2c462e5b18f317328", "title": "Straggler Mitigation through Unequal Error Protection for Distributed Matrix Multiplication"}, {"paperId": "bd959d6a44c6390229fee70d29a8bac65652e6f6", "title": "Performance Prediction of Sparse Matrix Multiplication on a Distributed BigData Processing Environment"}, {"paperId": "27df2f246c9850cf243db39ad38a236587541498", "title": "I/O resource isolation of public cloud serverless function runtimes for data-intensive applications"}]}
