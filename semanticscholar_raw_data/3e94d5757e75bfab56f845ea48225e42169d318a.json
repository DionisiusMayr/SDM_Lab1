It is due to fast growing of internet and increasing the size of data files. Therefore, it is necessary to represent the data in a simple form because it consists of multidimensional, which can be very simple through the traditional table representation. In the current scenario, the size of database is increasing and many organizations are storing the data over on the cloud servers. The present work is an attempt to store the complex database into the data cube technology, thereafter extracted the desired database within fraction of time. Further, correlation coefficient is obtained for analysis of data. The proposed technique is efficient and less time consuming for the long database, considered in the form of credit card information. That proposed technique can be used for decision-making process in banking industry.", "venue": "", "year": null, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2212433160", "name": "Banshidhar Choudhary"}, {"authorId": "2261043750", "name": "Prof. Vipin Saxena"}], "citations": []}
