Unfortunately, these DNNs are computationally slow and inefficient, leading to considerable delays and resource constraints in the sequence analysis process. A Computation-In-Memory (CIM) architecture using memristors can significantly accelerate the performance of DNNs. However, inherent device non-idealities and architectural limitations of such designs can greatly degrade the basecalling accuracy, which is critical for accurate genome analysis. To facilitate the adoption of memristor-based CIM designs for basecalling, it is important to (1) conduct a comprehensive analysis of potential CIM architectures and (2) develop effective strategies for mitigating the possible adverse effects of inherent device non-idealities and architectural limitations.This paper proposes Swordfish, a novel hardware/software co-design framework that can effectively address the two aforementioned issues. Swordfish incorporates seven circuit and device restrictions or non-idealities from characterized real memristor-based chips. Swordfish leverages various hardware/software co-design solutions to mitigate the basecalling accuracy loss due to such non-idealities. To demonstrate the effectiveness of Swordfish, we take Bonito, the state-of-the-art (i.e., accurate and fast), open-source basecaller as a case study. Our experimental results using Swordfish show that a CIM architecture can realistically accelerate Bonito for a wide range of real datasets by an average of 25.7\u00d7, with an accuracy loss of 6.01%.CCS CONCEPTS\u2022 Hardware \u2192 Analysis and design of emerging devices and systems; Memory and dense storage; Biology-related information processing.", "venue": "Micro", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Biology"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book"], "publicationDate": "2023-10-06", "journal": {"name": "2023 56th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO)", "pages": "1437-1452"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "51017214", "name": "Taha Shahroodi"}, {"authorId": "2256934925", "name": "Gagandeep Singh"}, {"authorId": "1864957026", "name": "Mahdi Zahedi"}, {"authorId": "3064097", "name": "Haiyu Mao"}, {"authorId": "2160629076", "name": "Joel Lindegger"}, {"authorId": "3432690", "name": "Can Firtina"}, {"authorId": "2171100110", "name": "Stephan Wong"}, {"authorId": "2065984781", "name": "O.
