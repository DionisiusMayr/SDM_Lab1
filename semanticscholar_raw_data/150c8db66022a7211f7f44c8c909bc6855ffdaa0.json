Given the mature space, it might seem like a Herculean task to enter the market as a small startup. At Firebolt we assembled a working, high-performance cloud data warehouse in less than 18 months. We achieved this by building our query engine on top of existing projects and then investing heavily into differentiating features. This paper presents our decision-making and learned lessons along the way.", "venue": "CDMS@VLDB", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2152484", "name": "Mosha Pasumansky"}, {"authorId": "2182426095", "name": "Benjamin Wagner"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "f1914f4264d8e1051a53759120504b8a425d4b8e", "title": "Building a Serverless Data Lakehouse from Spare Parts"}, {"paperId": "fc1633d6d3f4ea034f839e889a58fbd46edb3b61", "title": "The Composable Data Management System Manifesto"}, {"paperId": "423cfc9d5f61e1deca43b5a82d1d503c4ddf339e", "title": "Towards Unifying Query Interpretation and Compilation"}, {"paperId": "ce71be82ff41e0849f09cf337faa943989dd9c08", "title": "Incremental Fusion: Unifying Compiled and Vectorized Query Execution"}]}
