With the expansion of the scale of offshore wind farm, the traditional centralized offshore substation is facing the problems of large installation capacity and difficult construction. Therefore, a new technology-lightweight offshore substation, is introduced, and an improved k-medoids clustering method is proposed to establish the life cycle cost model of the new offshore wind farm collection system. In addition, considering the environmental impact, the collection system is optimized for different voltage levels, The Nash equilibrium theory of multiparty game evaluation is used to evaluate each scheme. Taking an offshore wind farm in a certain sea area as an example, the final results show that the integrated performance of the offshore wind farm collection system can be effectively improved by introducing the light substation and optimizing the voltage level.", "venue": "2021 3rd International Conference on Smart Power & Internet Energy Systems (SPIES)", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2021-09-25", "journal": {"name": "2021 3rd International Conference on Smart Power & Internet Energy Systems (SPIES)", "pages": "246-251"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2144254724", "name": "Ren Zixu"}, {"authorId": "2146588406", "name": "Song Shan"}, {"authorId": "2144254775", "name": "Yan Mengfei"}, {"authorId": "2147135284", "name": "Wu Qian"}, {"authorId": "2155401469", "name": "Wang Yang"}, {"authorId": "101761699", "name": "Wei Shurong"}], "citations": []}
