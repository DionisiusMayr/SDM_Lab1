Data movements incurred by GC may invalidate the pointers to objects on NVM and, hence, harm the reusability of persistent data across executions. The article proposes the concept of movement-oblivious addressing (MOA), and develops and compares three novel solutions to materialize the concept for solving the addressability problem. It evaluates the designs on five benchmarks and a real-world application. The results demonstrate the promise of the proposed solutions, especially hardware-supported Multi-Level GPointer, in addressing the problem in a space- and time-efficient manner.", "venue": "ACM Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization (TACO)", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-01-31", "journal": {"name": "ACM Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization (TACO)", "pages": "1 - 26", "volume": "19"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1715145", "name": "Chencheng Ye"}, {"authorId": "7870162", "name": "Yuanchao Xu"}, {"authorId": "37914192", "name": "Xipeng Shen"}, {"authorId": "145914251", "name": "Hai Jin"}, {"authorId": "144925807", "name": "Xiaofei Liao"}, {"authorId": "1717365", "name": "Yan Solihin"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "6146e0cfbf7820e71f8e3c69b972bd1c263ca7dc", "title": "Persistent Processor Architecture"}, {"paperId": "c0501daf0f01738320040f69d1ede6f83bf8c38c", "title": "Pointer Analysis for Programs on Hybrid DRAM-PM Memory Systems"}, {"paperId": "a36051d0999968778d7933820e7c451b2754d982", "title": "Reconciling Selective Logging and Hardware Persistent Memory Transaction"}, {"paperId": "32b84001880df214d956ad619e3ccea327f10a95", "title": "SpecPMT: Speculative Logging for Resolving Crash Consistency Overhead of Persistent Memory"}]}
