The recommendation system aims to provide users with accurate project recommendations, which can effectively solve the problem of information explosion caused by a large amount of data. Traditional recommendation systems are widely used in movie shopping. Aiming at this problem, this paper designs and develops a collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm based on big data platform. Firstly, the depth is deeper than the traditional automatic coding network, and the new activation function is used to generate the depth feature vector. Secondly, the model can describe both linear and nonlinear features of movie data, which further improves the extraction ability of nonlinear features. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is effective and can bring better user experience and economic benefits to consumers.", "venue": "Mathematical Problems in Engineering", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-05-31", "journal": {"name": "Mathematical Problems in Engineering"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2167658457", "name": "Guojian Miao"}, {"authorId": "2167728179", "name": "Yin Gao"}, {"authorId": "15044149", "name": "Zhenshen Zhu"}], "citations": []}
