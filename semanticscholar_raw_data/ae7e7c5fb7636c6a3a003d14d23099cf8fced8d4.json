Each IoT device in a smart factory can be coupled with a digital twin, that is, a dynamic virtual representation of the physical system across its life-cycle using real-time sensor data. Currently, the manufacturing process itself, the involved devices, and how they interact, is designed by human experts in a traditional way. We envision an architecture where humans can instead specify a goal and take advantage of technologies such as digital twins to automatically compose the corresponding physical processes, sharing some analogies with the notion of Web service composition", "venue": "2019 IEEE International Conference on Web Services (ICWS)", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2019-07-01", "journal": {"name": "2019 IEEE International Conference on Web Services (ICWS)", "pages": "229-236"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1772402", "name": "T.
