Abstract This study attempts to use big data technology to manage and analyze the geoscience data with large amount, wide sources and various formats accumulated for many years. The traditional data processing methods are mostly based on pure database and single machine, which is slow and difficult to achieve good results of data service. Hadoop is a distributed, semi-structured data management platform, which can be used to access large data quickly and conveniently. It has been proved by practice that the Hadoop platform can not only effectively complete all kinds of geoscience data processing, but also greatly improve the processing speed. It has good practicability and versatility, and provides technical support for further analysis and application of geoscience big data.", "venue": "Scientific Journal of Research & Reviews", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2021-04-21", "journal": {"name": "Scientific Journal of Research & Reviews"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2075413686", "name": "Zhiqiang Zeng"}], "citations": []}
