Mapreduce became an advanced tool to tackle these problems with processing of large arrays of data. As a result, many current Mapreduce frameworks such as Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark rely on Mapreduce as a backbone technology to solve their large-scale problems. Though, such approaches have their benefits, performance wise they cannot always guarantee a linear speed-up and hence a new parallel methods and frameworks needs a thorough study in order to understand scalability and performance benefits in these cases. In this work we present Kmeans parallel (||) clustering algorithm implemented in a partitioned address space Mapreduce system. This work includes a comparison and performance analysis of the presented implementation. In the paper we propose a novel approach that was not considered in literature before. In particular, it was found that our Mapreduce implementation of Kmeans parallel algorithm achieves a strongly linear speed-up that makes this approach an excellent candidate to solve high-dimensional and large-scale clustering problems.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "150290217", "name": "Shomanov Aday"}], "citations": []}
