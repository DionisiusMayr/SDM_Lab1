Our review included multi-disciplinary publications in English from 2014 to 2017 using Springer, Oxford library, Elsevier, PubMed, Google Scholar, and Springer search engines using terms of \u201caugmented reality (AR), \u201cplastic surgery,\u201d and \u201csurgery \u201c and \u201cAugmented Reality Ethics and challenges\u201d. It was shown that AR has been successfully effective in different branches of surgery, but with concerns and challenges like acceptance, privacy, different physical, security and behavioral threats. To come over them partially, a methodological approach for cyber threat landscape proactive exploration has been suggested.", "venue": "World journal of plastic surgery", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2019-04-01", "journal": {"name": "World Journal of Plastic Surgery", "pages": "135 - 145", "volume": "8"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "150104067", "name": "Fatemeh Salehahmadi"}, {"authorId": "51129441", "name": "F.
