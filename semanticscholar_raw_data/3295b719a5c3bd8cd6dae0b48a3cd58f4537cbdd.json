In this paper, we use conditioned neural language models to learn vector representations for 510 online communities. We use these representations to measure linguistic variation between commu-nities and investigate the degree to which linguistic variation corresponds with social connections between communities. We find that our sociolinguistic embeddings are highly correlated with a social network-based representation that does not use any linguistic input.", "venue": "NLPCSS", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the Fifth Workshop on Natural Language Processing and Computational Social Science (NLP+CSS)"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2074687981", "name": "Bill Noble"}, {"authorId": "2065998688", "name": "Jean-Philippe Bernardy"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "d2d96dc3bbf9d63c85f445e3fa08ad695457a532", "title": "LLM Agents in Interaction: Measuring Personality Consistency and Linguistic Alignment in Interacting Populations of Large Language Models"}, {"paperId": "7564a279f7f27e219783033e675ee4f909ab4b3d", "title": "Investigating Online Community Engagement through Stancetaking"}]}
