Unfortunately, these characteristics hinder automated shell-script distribution, often necessary for dealing with large datasets that do not fit on a single computer. This paper introduces D I S H , a system that distributes the execution of dynamic shell scripts operating on distributed filesys-tems. D I S H is designed as a shim that applies program analyses and transformations to leverage distributed computing, while delegating all execution to the underlying shell available on each computing node. As a result, D I S H does not require modifications to shell scripts and maintains compatibility with existing shells and legacy functionality. We evaluate D I S H against several options available to users today: (i) Bash, a single-node shell-interpreter baseline, (ii) P A S H , a state-of-the-art automated-parallelization system, and (iii) Hadoop Streaming, a MapReduce system that supports language-agnostic third-party components. Combined, our results demonstrate that D I S H offers significant performance gains, requires no developer effort, and handles arbitrary dynamic behaviors pervasive in real-world shell scripts.", "venue": "Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"pages": "341-356"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2187456660", "name": "Tammam Mustafa"}, {"authorId": "91973722", "name": "Konstantinos Kallas"}, {"authorId": "2285075080", "name": "Pratyush Das"}, {"authorId": "2220400096", "name": "Nikos Vasilakis"}], "citations": []}
