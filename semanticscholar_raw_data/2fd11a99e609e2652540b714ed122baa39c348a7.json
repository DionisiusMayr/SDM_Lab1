The first part covered two major algorithmic approaches to large-scale optimization, namely, decomposition methods and hybridization methods, such as memetic algorithms and local search. In this part, we focus on sampling and variation operators, approximation and surrogate modeling, initialization methods, and parallelization. We also cover a range of problem areas in relation to large-scale global optimization, such as multiobjective optimization, constraint handling, overlapping components, the component imbalance issue and benchmarks, and applications. The article also includes a discussion on pitfalls and challenges of the current research and identifies several potential areas of future research.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-10-01", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation", "pages": "823-843", "volume": "26"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2636102", "name": "M.
