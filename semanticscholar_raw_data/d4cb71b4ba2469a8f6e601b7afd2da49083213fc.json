However, the existing researches mainly focus on a single respective in this field, which motivates in comprehensively providing a forward\u2010looking guidance and development direction for scholars and engineers. To this end, the latest developments of SD\u2010ICN is presented. First, the widely\u2010accepted concepts and impacts on traditional networks are introduced. Second, the shortcomings of SDN and ICN over conventional networks are respectively analyzed to illustrate the necessity of SD\u2010ICN. Third, based on extensive analysis and deep deliberation, a methodical taxonomy for existing combination studies is proposed. They are divided into SDN over ICN, ICN over SDN, and mutual immersive pattern. Fourth, the performances of three integration categories are compared and the limitations of related works are highlighted. Fifth, the maturity index from six development indicators are evaluated. Further, the maturity and practicality of these schemes are generalized. Based on the above studies and comparisons, the lessons learned by SDN and ICN developments are concluded. Finally, future research directions and opportunities are discussed for the\u00a0readers.", "venue": "IET Communications", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-11-11", "journal": {"name": "IET Commun.", "pages": "2237-2274", "volume": "17"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "30142783", "name": "Zhengyang Ai"}, {"authorId": "2266424684", "name": "Ming Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2243245976", "name": "Weiting Zhang"}, {"authorId": "145993626", "name": "Jiawen Kang"}, {"authorId": "2266419179", "name": "Lingling Tong"}, {"authorId": "2266429108", "name": "Yunqiang Duan"}], "citations": []}
