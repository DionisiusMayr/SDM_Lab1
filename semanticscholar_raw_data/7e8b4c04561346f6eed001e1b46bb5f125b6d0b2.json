We explore ONN technology potentials from device to analog circuit-level simulations. We report that ONN behaves like an associative memory and can implement energy-based models such as Hopfield Neural Networks on edge devices. Finally, as a proof of concept, a reconfigurable digital ONN is implemented on FPGA for pattern recognition tasks.", "venue": "IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-07-01", "journal": {"name": "2021 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI (ISVLSI)", "pages": "326-331"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2115013041", "name": "Corentin Delacour"}, {"authorId": "7990765", "name": "S.
