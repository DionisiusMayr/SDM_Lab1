Due to several reasons, such as better quality of produce, less expensive alternative, and with the accessibility of the Internet, it has been made possible for people to gain the information they need for gardening and equipment. The recent advancement and dependence on the Internet today, allowed the development of Internet of things (IoT). With IoT, it is possible to connect anything to the \"cloud\" using hardware such as a microcontroller units. Application of this technology could be seen from agriculture, manufacturing, health and home security. This study focused on the integration of urban agriculture on indoor gardening. The developed system provided plant owners and enthusiasts a possible way of monitoring plants' condition in an indoor setup through a mobile application. The mobile application gives updates and information, such as light and water plant needs, through the use of microcontroller unit sensors and other components. Sensors used and connected to the indoor plants provide information like the indoor temperature and humidity, plant's soil moisture and the water level of the water source. By using a mobile application, analysis of the plant conditions can be determined and known by the plant owners through a connection with the cloud. This study shows that the developed system is highly recommended as a means of alternative urban gardening and has a high commercial viability.", "venue": "Proceedings of the 2019 2nd International Conference on Information Science and Systems", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2019-03-16", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Information Science and Systems"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "9307946", "name": "M.
