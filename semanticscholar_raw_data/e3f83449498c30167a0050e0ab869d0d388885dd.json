English tweets were collected from Twitter's free streaming Application Programming Interface (API). The Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm was applied to extract latent topics from the tweets. User sentiments were extracted using the NRC Affect Intensity Lexicon and SentiStrength tools. This study explored the benefits, challenges, and future implications of integrating GAI chatbots in higher education. The findings shed light on the potential power of such tools, exemplified by Bard, in enhancing the learning process and providing support to students throughout their educational journey.", "venue": "2023 International Conference on Big Data, Knowledge and Control Systems Engineering (BdKCSE)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-11-02", "journal": {"name": "2023 International Conference on Big Data, Knowledge and Control Systems Engineering (BdKCSE)", "pages": "1-6"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3425298", "name": "Samer Muthana Sarsam"}, {"authorId": "143744741", "name": "A.
