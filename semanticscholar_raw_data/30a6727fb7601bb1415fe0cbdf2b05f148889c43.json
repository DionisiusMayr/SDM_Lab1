This paper introduces NII Table Linker, a dataset searching framework designed for the two English and Japanese sub-tasks of the NTCIR-15 Data Search Task (DST). In particular, we study the capacity of the standard information retrieval techniques on DST and introduce the four re-ranking models based on (1) pre-trained contextualized embeddings, (2) entity-centric, (3) data file content, and (4) cluster-based approach. On the English sub-task, the model using pre-trained contextualized embeddings achieves the 2 nd in the primary metric (nDCG@10) and the 1 st in the remaining metrics in the official evaluation. On the Japanese sub-task, our Japanese runs also achieve promising performance unofficial evaluation; the run of BM25 fine-tuned produces the 1 st in the nERR metrics.", "venue": "", "year": null, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2056638783", "name": "P.
