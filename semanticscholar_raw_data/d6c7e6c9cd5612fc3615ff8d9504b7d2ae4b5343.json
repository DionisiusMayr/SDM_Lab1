However, with the continuous expansion of the scale of HSR, the competition between the two has become increasingly fierce, and HSR has gradually been substituted for aviation in some regions. Therefore, based on HSR flow and airline flow data, we depicted the spatio-temporal evolution pattern of China\u2019s urban network from 2017 to 2021 by constructing the HSR\u2013aviation composite network, then identified the spatial scope and network form of the substitution of HSR for aviation through classifying the four types of segments, and analyzed the influencing factors of this substitution effect. The results showed that the spatial form of the HSR\u2013aviation composite network is \u201cspindle-shaped\u201d and has a right-skewness distribution; the spatial scope of HSR completely or partially substituting for aviation is mainly distributed in the \u201cdiamond-shaped\u201d space with Beijing\u2013Shanghai\u2013Guangzhou\u2013Chengdu as the apex; and 0\u2013770\u2009km is the absolute advantage distance range of HSR. Moreover, the scale expansion of the composite network, the comparative advantages of HSR in shaping the urban network, the personal travel preference for HSR, and the distance between cities and city attributes are the main factors that make HSR a substitute for aviation.", "venue": "Transportation Research Record", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-12-26", "journal": {"name": "Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2265725488", "name": "Xueguang Ma"}, {"authorId": "2265630453", "name": "Ce Jiang"}, {"authorId": "2276979310", "name": "Zhao Zhang"}], "citations": []}
