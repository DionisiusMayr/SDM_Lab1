A total of 60 postgraduate students were invited to participate in this study. In addition, students\u2019 perceptions of library-supported learning were analysed via drawing analysis.\n\n\nFindings\nIntroducing ASQE-based learning into an IL learning activity promoted reflection and thought and had positive effects on students\u2019 problem-solving awareness and on the critical thinking tendency of students with different levels of growth mindset. Additionally, the drawing analysis indicated that most of the students with low levels of growth mindset believed that learners should actively study in the library and students with higher levels of growth mindset preferred more motivating and enjoyable learning environments.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThe findings of this study demonstrate that the ASQE-based learning approach can improve higher order thinking skills of students with different levels of growth mindset. In addition, this study examined the perceptions of students with different levels of growth mindset of library-supported learning via drawing analysis.\n", "venue": "Electronic library", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-04-28", "journal": {"name": "Electron.
