The presence of differences between body types could lead to different behavior of wearable and fitness-devote products. A new wearable based on machine learning techniques for the exercise detection and repetitions count is described in this work. A proper dataset has been obtained in order to offline train the network. Eventually, the machine learning algorithm has been implemented inside an edge device for real-time test e verification.", "venue": "2020 IEEE 20th Mediterranean Electrotechnical Conference ( MELECON)", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2020-06-01", "journal": {"name": "2020 IEEE 20th Mediterranean Electrotechnical Conference ( MELECON)", "pages": "212-215"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "34547690", "name": "M.
