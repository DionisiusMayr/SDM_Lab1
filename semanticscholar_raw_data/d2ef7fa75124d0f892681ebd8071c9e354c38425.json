Compared to existing solutions, TAPA has two major advantages. First, TAPA provides a set of convenient APIs that allows users to easily express flexible and complex inter-task communication structures. Second, TAPA adopts a coarse-grained floorplanning step during HLS compilation for accurate pipelining of potential critical paths. In addition, TAPA implements several optimization techniques specifically tailored for modern HBM-based FPGAs. In our experiments with a total of 43 designs, we improve the average frequency from 147 MHz to 297 MHz (a 102% improvement) with no loss of throughput and a negligible change in resource utilization. Notably, in 16 experiments, we make the originally unroutable designs achieve 274 MHz, on average. The framework is available at https://github.com/UCLA-VAST/tapa and the core floorplan module is available at https://github.com/UCLA-VAST/AutoBridge", "venue": "ACM Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-09-06", "journal": {"name": "ACM Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems", "pages": "1 - 31", "volume": "16"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "150187567", "name": "Licheng Guo"}, {"authorId": "153850982", "name": "Yuze Chi"}, {"authorId": "147099359", "name": "Jason Lau"}, {"authorId": "2719313", "name": "Linghao Song"}, {"authorId": "73427792", "name": "Xingyu Tian"}, {"authorId": "2184145208", "name": "Moazin Khatti"}, {"authorId": "35492800", "name": "W.
