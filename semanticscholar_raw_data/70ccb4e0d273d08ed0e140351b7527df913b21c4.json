These languages also provide a unified formalism that can express important classes of queries including fixpoint, while, and all computable queries. They can also incorporate in a natural fashion updates and nondeterminism. Datalog variants with forward chaining semantics have been adopted in a variety of settings, including active databases, production systems, distributed data exchange, and data-driven reactive systems.", "venue": "ACM SIGACT-SIGMOD-SIGART Symposium on Principles of Database Systems", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle", "Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2021-06-20", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 40th ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGAI Symposium on Principles of Database Systems"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1765187", "name": "V.
