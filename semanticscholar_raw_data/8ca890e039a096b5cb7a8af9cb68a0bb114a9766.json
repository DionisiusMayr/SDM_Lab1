However, data science and machine learning workloads today typically involve recursive or iterative computation. In this work, we propose a novel framework for optimizing recursive queries using methods from program synthesis. In particular, we introduce a simple yet powerful optimization rule called the \"FGH-rule\" which aims to find a faster way to evaluate a recursive program. The solution is found by making use of powerful tools, such as a program synthesizer, an SMT-solver, and an equality saturation system. We demonstrate the strength of the optimization by showing that the FGH-rule can lead to speedups up to 4 orders of magnitude on three, already optimized Datalog systems.", "venue": "SIGMOD Conference", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-02-21", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 2022 International Conference on Management of Data"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2115869792", "name": "Y.
