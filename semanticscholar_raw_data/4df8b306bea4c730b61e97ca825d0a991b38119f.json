Key technologies including the big data acquisition and integration, big data mining and knowledge sharing mechanism were developed for the big data analytics for AM.\n\n\nFindings\nThe presented framework was demonstrated by an application scenario from a company of three-dimensional printing solutions. The results show that the proposed framework benefited customers, manufacturers, environment and even all aspects of manufacturing phase.\n\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nThis study only proposed a framework, and did not include the realization of the algorithm for data analysis, such as association, classification and clustering.\n\n\nPractical implications\nThe proposed framework can be used to optimize the quality, energy consumption and production efficiency of the AM process.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThis paper introduces the concept of big data in the field of AM. The proposed framework can be used to make better decisions based on the big data during manufacturing process.\n", "venue": "Rapid prototyping journal", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2019-03-04", "journal": {"name": "Rapid Prototyping Journal"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "88175938", "name": "A.
