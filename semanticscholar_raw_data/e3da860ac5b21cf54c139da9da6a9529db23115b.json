However, due to the different configurations of machines, the traditional CUDA + GPU technology has obvious limitations in portability and seamlessness. According to gridding algorithm in MingantU SpEctral Radioheliograph (MUSER) data processing, the OpenCL technology is used in parallel to implement multi-thread programming. The experimental results show that the gridding algorithm based on OpenCL can not only can run on various GPUs, but also merely on CPUs. While choosing execution on GPU, the execution efficiency of gridding algorithm is approximately equal with it based on CUDA. At the same time, the algorithm is not limited to the NVIDIA\u2019s GPU, which has solved the problem of environmental dependence of CUDA+GPU. And the algorithm also has an acceptable execution efficiency high implementation with the merely CPU, which is suitable for development and testing astronomy software with a single machine , but also and will facilitate the application and promotion of astronomical software.", "venue": "", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2055370748", "name": "Feng Yong"}, {"authorId": "2114324775", "name": "Wang Feng"}, {"authorId": "2061441662", "name": "Deng Hui"}, {"authorId": "2263920582", "name": "Shoulin Wei"}, {"authorId": "2048648108", "name": "Mei Ying"}, {"authorId": "2114005235", "name": "Dai Wei"}, {"authorId": "8798175", "name": "Congming Shi"}], "citations": []}
