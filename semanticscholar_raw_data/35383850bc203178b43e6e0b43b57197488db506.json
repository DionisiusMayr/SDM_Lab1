Unlike DBMS, however, Python applications may lose important data, such as trained models and extracted features, due to machine failures or human errors, leading to a waste of time and resources. Specifically, they lack four essential properties that could make ML more reliable and user-friendly---durability, atomicity, replicability, and time-versioning (DART). This paper presents our vision of Transactional Python that provides DART without any code modifications to user programs or the Python kernel, by non-intrusively monitoring application states at the object level and determining a minimal amount of information sufficient to reconstruct a whole application. Our evaluation of a proof-of-concept implementation with public PyTorch and scikit-learn applications shows that DART can be offered with overheads ranging 1.5%--15.6%.", "venue": "DEEM@SIGMOD", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book"], "publicationDate": "2023-05-15", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the Seventh Workshop on Data Management for End-to-End Machine Learning"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "41022386", "name": "Supawit Chockchowwat"}, {"authorId": "2040810002", "name": "Zhaoheng Li"}, {"authorId": "40155297", "name": "Yongjoo Park"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "2aa4f898e28e4cdea16f6c7baa403a7db5d91eb5", "title": "ElasticNotebook: Enabling Live Migration for Computational Notebooks (Technical Report)"}]}
