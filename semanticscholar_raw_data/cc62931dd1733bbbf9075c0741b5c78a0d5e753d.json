In particular we make use of state-of-the-art decision tree algorithms for detecting whether a Web site is able to perform phishing activities. If this is the case, the Web site is classified as a Web-phishing site. Our experimental evaluation confirms the benefits of applying machine learning methods to the well-known web-phishing detection problem.", "venue": "International Database Engineering and Applications Symposium", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book"], "publicationDate": "2019-06-10", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 23rd International Database Applications & Engineering Symposium"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "145046124", "name": "A.
