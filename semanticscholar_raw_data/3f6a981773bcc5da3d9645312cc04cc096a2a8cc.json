Meanwhile, the dramatic in-crease in energy consumption of ICT calls for new methodologies to reduce the ecological impact of application orchestration, making it environmentally sustainable. This article conducts a systematic literature review of the state-of-the-art related to environmentally sustainable orchestration of containerised applications in Cloud-Edge settings. Ultimately, it points to open challenges and directions for future work in the field.", "venue": "International Symposium on Service Oriented Software Engineering", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-07-01", "journal": {"name": "2023 IEEE International Conference on Service-Oriented System Engineering (SOSE)", "pages": "250-261"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1390050126", "name": "Marco Gaglianese"}, {"authorId": "2265546", "name": "J.
