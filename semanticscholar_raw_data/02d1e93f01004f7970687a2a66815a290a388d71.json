We discuss our work in the context of workload analysis and monitoring. As an example, evolving system usage patterns in a database system can cause load imbalance and performance regressions which can be controlled by monitoring system usage patterns, i.e., a representative workload, over time. To construct such a workload in a principled manner, we formalize the notions of workload\n representativity\n and\n coverage.\n These metrics capture the intuition that the distribution of features in a compressed workload should match a target distribution, increasing representativity, and include common queries as well as outliers, increasing coverage. We show that solving this problem optimally is computationally hard and present a novel greedy algorithm that provides approximation guarantees. We compare our techniques to established algorithms in this problem space such as sampling and clustering, and demonstrate advantages and key trade-offs.\n", "venue": "Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-11-01", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2011.05549"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "34691891", "name": "Shaleen Deep"}, {"authorId": "3202556", "name": "Anja Gruenheid"}, {"authorId": "1713920", "name": "Paraschos Koutris"}, {"authorId": "5151034", "name": "J.
