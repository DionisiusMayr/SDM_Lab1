This study employs surveys and case studies to gather data and information, subsequently analyzing it to identify opportunities and challenges. The proposed solutions encompass remote sensing, technology integration, farmer education, and stakeholder engagement. The research delves into smart technologies in animal production, addressing opportunities, challenges, and potential solutions. Smart agriculture employs modern technology to improve efficiency, sustainability, and animal welfare in livestock farming. This includes remote monitoring, GPS-based animal care, robotic milking, smart health collars, predictive disease control, and other innovations. Despite the great promise of smart animal production, there are existing challenges such as cost, data management, and connectivity. To overcome these challenges, potential solutions involve remote sensing, technology integration, and farmer education. Smart agriculture provides opportunities for increased efficiency, improved animal welfare, and enhanced environmental conservation. A well-planned approach is crucial to maximize the benefits of smart livestock production while ensuring its long-term sustainability. This study confirms the growing adoption of smart agriculture in livestock production, with the potential to support the sustainable development goals and deliver benefits such as increased productivity and resource efficiency. To fully realize these benefits and ensure the sustainability of livestock farming, addressing cost and education challenges is essential. Therefore, this study recommends promoting a positive outlook among livestock stakeholders and embracing smart agriculture to enhance farm performance.", "venue": "Ruminants", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2024-01-26", "journal": {"name": "Ruminants"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "51123014", "name": "M.
