Nevertheless, the results of the PKPPD report in DTP 3.0 showed that the management of big data in PPD does not reach the set standards. Therefore, a study was conducted to identify the need and importance of developing a PPD big data management model in Malaysia. A total of 10 big data personnel from 10 PPDs in different states were interviewed. The findings of the study showed that there are seven requirements and three importances of developing the PPD big data management model in Malaysia. Therefore, there is a need for the development of a big data management model in PPD as a guide and reference for all PPD\u2019s big data personnnel in Malaysia.", "venue": "Journal of Business and Social Development", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-03-31", "journal": {"name": "JOURNAL OF BUSINESS AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "120665028", "name": "Nordin Mohamad"}, {"authorId": "2264144438", "name": "Norfariza MOHD RAZI"}, {"authorId": "2060553461", "name": "Zuraidah Abdullah"}], "citations": []}
