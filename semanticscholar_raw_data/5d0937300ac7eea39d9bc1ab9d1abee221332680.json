The developed tool aims to automatically detect aircrafts on satellite imagery at very high resolution (<1m). It relies on the Scaled YOLOv4 deep learning model which has proven to be a good object detector. Trained on open-source annotated datasets, our model shows very good performance to detect common commercial airplanes on Pl\u00e9iades images, but misses small planes or other types of aircrafts. We indicate several possible improvements, thanks to a large dataset of Pl\u00e9iades images that we annotated ourselves and thanks to the production of synthetic images combining Pl\u00e9iades data with artificial superimposed aircrafts.", "venue": "Joint Urban Remote Sensing Event", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-05-17", "journal": {"name": "2023 Joint Urban Remote Sensing Event (JURSE)", "pages": "1-4"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2219803882", "name": "Benjamin Palmaerts"}, {"authorId": "47671786", "name": "B.
