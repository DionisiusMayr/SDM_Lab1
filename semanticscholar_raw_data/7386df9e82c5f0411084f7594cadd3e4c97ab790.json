The promise of decreased latencies, increased computational parallelism, and higher storage densities with crossbar non-volatile memory (NVM) based in-memory-computing/processing-in-memory techniques is not without its caveats. This paper surveys this rich landscape and highlights the advantages and challenges of emerging NVMs as multi-level synaptic emulators in various neural network types and applications. Current and potential methods for reliably programming these devices in a crossbar matrix are discussed, as well as techniques for reliably integrating and propagating matrix products to emulate the well-known MAC-like operations throughout the neural network. This paper complements previous surveys, but most importantly uncovers further areas of ongoing research relating to the viability of analog-based ANN implementations based on state-of-the-art NVM technologies in the context of hardware accelerators. While many previous reviews of analog-based ANN focus on device characteristics, this review presents the perspective of crossbar arrays, peripheral circuitry and the required architectural and system considerations for an emerging memory crossbar neural network.", "venue": "Neuromorph.
