Over the past decade, numerous endeavors have contributed to the evolution of TSP solutions, uncovering similarities and distinctions among them. Despite these advances, a universally accepted standard approach for integrating transactional functionality with stream processing remains to be established. Existing TSP solutions predominantly concentrate on specific application characteristics and involve complex design trade-offs. This survey intends to introduce TSP and present our perspective on its future progression. Our primary goals are twofold: to provide insights into the diverse TSP requirements and methodologies, and to inspire the design and development of groundbreaking TSP systems.", "venue": "The VLDB journal", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-08-21", "journal": {"name": "VLDB J.", "pages": "451-479", "volume": "33"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2188004", "name": "Shuhao Zhang"}, {"authorId": "34415034", "name": "Juan Soto"}, {"authorId": "1733290", "name": "V.
