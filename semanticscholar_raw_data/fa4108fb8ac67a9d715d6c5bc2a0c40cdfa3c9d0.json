Students generally look for the outcome and, in this case, it is being placed. Every institution strives to have a strong Placement team. The aim of this research paper is to enhance the overall performance of the system by introducing a student placement prediction system. The goal lies in increasing the accuracy of the system as a whole. Various parameters are taken into consideration to predict if the student is placed or not. This paper studies different machine learning algorithms such as Logistic regression, Random Forest, KNN, SVM. These machine learning algorithms will be used to predict the results on a common database individually. The final result will be compared in order to each other in order to study which algorithm has the highest accuracy and works best for the system.", "venue": "2023 2nd International Conference on Edge Computing and Applications (ICECAA)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-07-19", "journal": {"name": "2023 2nd International Conference on Edge Computing and Applications (ICECAA)", "pages": "903-907"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2231808133", "name": "Gurivireddy Mary Spandana"}, {"authorId": "79691001", "name": "L.
