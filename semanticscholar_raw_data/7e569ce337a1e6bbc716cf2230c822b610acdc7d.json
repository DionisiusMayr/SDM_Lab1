Timely identification of students at risk has high practical value in effective students\u2019 retention services. Big Data mining and machine learning methods are applied to manipulate, analyze and predict students\u2019 failure, supporting self-directed learning. Despite the extensive application of data mining to education, the imbalance problem in minority classes of students\u2019 attrition is often overlooked in conventional models. This document proposes a large data frame using the Hadoop ecosystem and the application of machine learning techniques to different datasets of an academic year at the Hellenic Open University. Datasets were divided into thirty-five weeks. Thirty-two classifiers were created, compared and statistical analyzed to address the minority classes\u2019 imbalance of student\u2019s failure. The algorithms metacost-SMO, and C4.5 provide the most accurate performance for each target class. Early predictions of timeframes determine a remarkable performance, while the importance of written assignments and specific quizzes is noticeable. The models\u2019 performance in any week is exploited by developing a prediction tool for student attrition, contributing to timely and personalized intervention.", "venue": "Interactive Learning Environments", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2019-10-25", "journal": {"name": "Interactive Learning Environments", "pages": "568 - 582", "volume": "30"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "30469865", "name": "Andreas F.
