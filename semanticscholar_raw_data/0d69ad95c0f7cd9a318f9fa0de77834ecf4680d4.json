In this paper, we give a systematic way to review data mining in knowledge view, technique view, and application view, including classification, clustering, association analysis, time series analysis and outlier analysis. And the latest application cases are also surveyed. As more and more devices connected to IoT, large volume of data should be analyzed, the latest algorithms should be modified to apply to big data. We reviewed these algorithms and discussed challenges and open research issues. At last a suggested big data mining system is proposed.", "venue": "Int. J. Distributed Sens.
