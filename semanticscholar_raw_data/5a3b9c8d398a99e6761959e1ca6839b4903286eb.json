While the use of simulation is already the state of the art in almost every engineering discipline, e.g., dynamic systems, plant engineering, and logistics, it is less common for edge computing. This work discusses different use cases concerning edge computing in IIoT that can profit from the use of OT simulation methods. In addition to enabling machine learning, the focus of this work is on the virtual commissioning of data stream processing systems. To evaluate the proposed approach, an exemplary application of the middleware layer, i.e., a multi-agent reinforcement learning system for intelligent edge resource allocation, is combined with a physical simulation model of an industrial plant. It confirms the feasibility of the proposed use of simulation for virtual commissioning of an industrial edge computing system using Hardware-in-the-Loop. In summary, edge computing in IIoT is highlighted as a new application area for existing simulation methods from the OT perspective. The benefits in IIoT are exemplified by various use cases for the logic or middleware layer using physical simulation of the target environment. The relevance for real-life IIoT systems is confirmed by an experimental evaluation, and limitations are pointed out.", "venue": "Italian National Conference on Sensors", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-03-28", "journal": {"name": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "volume": "23"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2151907603", "name": "Julia Rosenberger"}, {"authorId": "145755596", "name": "A.
