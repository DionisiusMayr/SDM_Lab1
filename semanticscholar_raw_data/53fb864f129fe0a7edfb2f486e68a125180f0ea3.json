This paper selects talent training in the field of agriculture as the goal to explore the intelligent push of network resources in the field of agricultural education. Combined with the establishment of collaborative association rules and the AutoSVD hybrid recommendation model, the K-Means algorithm was adopted to cluster the agricultural teaching resources information in the teaching resources retrieval model obtained in the early stage. Different types of resource clusters were obtained, and the resources with the most user preferences in each cluster were also obtained. Finally, the users in the same cluster were recommended. RMSE and MAE are calculated for comparison. Experiments verify that the performance of the hybrid model proposed in this paper is superior to that of the current mainstream models. The development and exploration of the theory of personalized learning will be beneficial from it. Thus, this study has some innovations.", "venue": "Intelligent Systems, Communications, and Computer Networks", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2023-06-16", "journal": {"pages": "1270213 - 1270213-5", "volume": "12702"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2215617105", "name": "Qi Wang"}, {"authorId": "2151300202", "name": "Guanghai Li"}], "citations": []}
