As part of the National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI), the German Human Genome-Phenome Archive (GHGA) strives to connect the data from German researchers and their institutions to the international landscape of genome research. To achieve this, GHGA partners up with international activities such as the federated European Genome-Phenome Archive (EGA) [1] and the recently funded European Genomic Data Infrastructure (GDI) project to enable participation in international studies while ensuring at the same time the proper protection of the sensitive patient data included in GHGA.", "venue": "CoRDI", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-09-07", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the Conference on Research Data Infrastructure"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2238701901", "name": "Luiz Gadelha"}, {"authorId": "2238707352", "name": "Jan Eufinger"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "ba4ec711731c0275ad730adef364f1f19f57def4", "title": "SODAR: managing multiomics study data and metadata"}]}
