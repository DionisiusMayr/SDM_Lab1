To address this problem, we explore a new approach that turns networking overheads into assets, repurposing the transport protocol and network stack features, some of which can be offloaded to the NIC hardware, for implementing the storage properties particularly for the PM devices.", "venue": "ACM Workshop on Hot Topics in Networks", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-11-04", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 20th ACM Workshop on Hot Topics in Networks"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1895414", "name": "Michio Honda"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "a490646bc1857939c94f9593d8398832fde0aeac", "title": "CPU-free Computing: A Vision with a Blueprint"}, {"paperId": "3f61775cb652637f9bec1b3ba93f11dfc8f45018", "title": "Hyperion: A Case for Unified, Self-Hosting, Zero-CPU Data-Processing Units (DPUs)"}]}
