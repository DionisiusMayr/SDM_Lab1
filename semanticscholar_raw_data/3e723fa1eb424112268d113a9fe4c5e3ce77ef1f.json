As persistent data is increasingly being created and maintained programmatically, prior work that infers data relationships from data statistics misses an important opportunity. We present Coco, the first tool that identifies data relationships by analyzing database-backed applications. Once identified, Coco leverages the constraints to optimize the application's physical design and query execution. Instead of developing a fixed set of predefined rewriting rules, Coco employs an enumerate-test-verify technique to automatically exploit the discovered data constraints to improve query execution. Each resulting rewrite is provably equivalent to the original query. Using 14 real-world web applications, our experiments show that Coco can discover numerous data constraints from code analysis and improve real-world application performance significantly.", "venue": "Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-05-05", "journal": {"name": "Proc.
