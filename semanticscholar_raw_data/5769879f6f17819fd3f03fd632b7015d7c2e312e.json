World models have emerged as a transformative approach, enabling autonomous driving systems to synthesize and interpret vast amounts of sensor data, thereby predicting potential future scenarios and compensating for information gaps. This paper provides an initial review of the current state and prospective advancements of world models in autonomous driving, spanning their theoretical underpinnings, practical applications, and the ongoing research efforts aimed at overcoming existing limitations. Highlighting the significant role of world models in advancing autonomous driving technologies, this survey aspires to serve as a foundational reference for the research community, facilitating swift access to and comprehension of this burgeoning field, and inspiring continued innovation and exploration.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2024-03-05", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2403.02622"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2283730555", "name": "Yanchen Guan"}, {"authorId": "2269958997", "name": "Haicheng Liao"}, {"authorId": "2273365115", "name": "Zhenning Li"}, {"authorId": "2290002927", "name": "Guohui Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2272208211", "name": "Chengzhong Xu"}], "citations": []}
