The fundamental inspiration for GAO is the mechanism of recognizing the position of the female species by the male species during the mating season and the hunting strategy of green anacondas. GAO\u2019s mathematical modeling is presented based on the simulation of these two strategies of green anacondas in two phases of exploration and exploitation. The effectiveness of the proposed GAO approach in solving optimization problems is evaluated on twenty-nine objective functions from the CEC 2017 test suite and the CEC 2019 test suite. The efficiency of GAO in providing solutions for optimization problems is compared with the performance of twelve well-known metaheuristic algorithms. The simulation results show that the proposed GAO approach has a high capability in exploration, exploitation, and creating a balance between them and performs better compared to competitor algorithms. In addition, the implementation of GAO on twenty-one optimization problems from the CEC 2011 test suite indicates the effective capability of the proposed approach in handling real-world applications.", "venue": "Biomimetics", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-03-01", "journal": {"name": "Biomimetics", "volume": "8"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2132379761", "name": "Mohammad Dehghani"}, {"authorId": "2150730612", "name": "Pavel Trojovsk\u00fd"}, {"authorId": "2128305375", "name": "O.
