This problem is NP-hard, and therefore there is not a known polynomial time approach to solve it. To find a close-to-optimal solution to the problem in a reasonable time, we present for the first time a clustering-enhanced memetic algorithm (CMA) that combines four components, i.e., (i) population initialization with clustering mechanism, (ii) a tabu-based nearby exploration phase to search nearby local optima in a restricted area, (iii) a three-parent combination operator to generate promising offspring solutions, and (iv) a mutation operator using L\u00e9vy distribution to prevent the population from premature. Computational experiments are carried on 36 benchmark instances from 3 standard sets, and the results show that the proposed algorithm is competitive with the state-of-the-art approaches. In particular, it reports improved upper bounds for the 25 most challenging instances with unproven optimal solutions, while matching the best-known results for all but 2 of the remaining instances. Additional analysis highlights the contribution of the clustering mechanism and combination operator to the performance of the algorithm.", "venue": "Entropy", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-12-31", "journal": {"name": "Entropy", "volume": "25"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "153327601", "name": "Shufan Zhang"}, {"authorId": "48384115", "name": "Jianlin Mao"}, {"authorId": "1992789317", "name": "Niya Wang"}, {"authorId": "2200190634", "name": "Dayan Li"}, {"authorId": "2200492388", "name": "Chengan Ju"}], "citations": []}
