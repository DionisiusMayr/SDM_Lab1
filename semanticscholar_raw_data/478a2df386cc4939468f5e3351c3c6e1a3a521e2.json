Driven by the breakthrough in deep learning (DL), organizations that have deployed these cameras start to use DL-based techniques for live video analytics. Although existing systems aim to optimize live video analytics from a variety of perspectives, they are agnostic to the workload dynamics in real-world deployments. In this work, we present Distream, a distributed live video analytics system based on the smart camera-edge cluster architecture, that is able to adapt to the workload dynamics to achieve low-latency, high-throughput, and scalable live video analytics. The key behind the design of Distream is to adaptively balance the workloads across smart cameras and partition the workloads between cameras and the edge cluster. In doing so, Distream is able to fully utilize the compute resources at both ends to achieve optimized system performance. We evaluated Distream with 500 hours of distributed video streams from two real-world video datasets with a testbed that consists of 24 cameras and a 4-GPU edge cluster. Our results show that Distream consistently outperforms the status quo in terms of throughput, latency, and latency service level objective (SLO) miss rate.", "venue": "ACM International Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2020-11-16", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 18th Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "97610749", "name": "Xiao Zeng"}, {"authorId": "2796901", "name": "Biyi Fang"}, {"authorId": "3050154", "name": "Haichen Shen"}, {"authorId": "48985664", "name": "Mi Zhang"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "63e5b3ea98e7e7aeaf1290e0f96a086906311225", "title": "CrossVision: Real-Time On-Camera Video Analysis via Common RoI Load Balancing"}, {"paperId": "6341106eb245e41737a47d14e1949e3373963524", "title": "Crowdsourcing Upon Learning: Energy-Aware Dispatch With Guarantee for Video Analytics"}, {"paperId": "249869ad503dbae9774bb340909b8a5a4911b406", "title": "Mondrian: On-Device High-Performance Video Analytics with Compressive Packed Inference"}, {"paperId": "33f226c1a22288313454eb92b642c840a80629c3", "title": "Live Migration of Video Analytics Applications in Edge Computing"}, {"paperId": "4e67da5c45fedebabbe2674446f9d44366360019", "title": "SplitStream: Distributed and workload-adaptive video analytics at the edge"}, {"paperId": "177fb44f7e994eb1eb03c133d385ce1194a52867", "title": "Enabling Cross-Camera Collaboration for Video Analytics on Distributed Smart Cameras"}, {"paperId": "3dfc6c80487868e6b84aa444d38edeff6eaee3c2", "title": "Distributed Task-Oriented Communication Networks with Multimodal Semantic Relay and Edge Intelligence"}, {"paperId": "5fa1b22748392dbd1bafe8b5a8587cd0b05bc0b5", "title": "SDN-LB: A novel server workload balancing algorithm for IoT video analytics"}, {"paperId": "be2880ca67d3a88ee9c1c2c0cfc8921598fedd8b", "title": "Collaborative Inference via Dynamic Composition of Tiny AI Accelerators on MCUs"}, {"paperId": "149e4aac8e626cb6bd849abb10ac6b0a93fba306", "title": "AdaMEC: Towards a Context-adaptive and Dynamically Combinable DNN Deployment Framework for Mobile Edge Computing"}, {"paperId": "7cf0edcb5a88c756f3f898d18dc149c62b32e589", "title": "Resource and Bandwidth-Aware Video Analytics with Adaptive Offloading"}, {"paperId": "68d17fa66d32c46af6db03db237c549047ef3d98", "title": "Large-scale Video Analytics with Cloud\u2013Edge Collaborative Continuous Learning"}, {"paperId": "cab1fda6d3f485d5e198958f24cf4a828d2f68c8", "title": "Analysis of communication overheads for DNN inference offloading techniques in homogeneous edge networks"}, {"paperId": "9d0182278ed9ce7541b5d23a301027d01b12d266", "title": "AdaInf: Data Drift Adaptive Scheduling for Accurate and SLO-guaranteed Multiple-Model Inference Serving at Edge Servers"}, {"paperId": "2d8372b8ca82cb426e63c42df190dd069cc17034", "title": "Edge-Assisted On-Device Model Update for Video Analytics in Adverse Environments"}, {"paperId": "f44bd2121b833e2f2ddda35cc37f9841eaf0695b", "title": "Dystri: A Dynamic Inference based Distributed DNN Service Framework on Edge"}, {"paperId": "6ec49e2ddbeae0e5a8204379d543375d62e4bc45", "title": "ESMO: Joint Frame Scheduling and Model Caching for Edge Video Analytics"}, {"paperId": "7034d45160c8cac0afb8e3a3c99ac3d8fec74145", "title": "Towards Timely Edge-assisted Video Analytics Services"}, {"paperId": "300eedd416faa7a08f998a027a31e4c2668c13ab", "title": "DeepStream: Bandwidth Efficient Multi-Camera Video Streaming for Deep Learning Analytics"}, {"paperId": "4f9045bb545e4936596ec1f09c59beca2219a985", "title": "Breaking On-device Training Memory Wall: A Systematic Survey"}, {"paperId": "ac393cc9907cdf1d5f179eec862a1c0a976327c1", "title": "Tracking Targets in Hyper-Scale Cameras Using Movement Predication"}, {"paperId": "287f54c5d71fecbea10f8e5a418c715425e4a1ff", "title": "Cross-Camera Inference on the Constrained Edge"}, {"paperId": "eb0ceb94a8c533467d1c3a7c84ff86ccba0264df", "title": "Exploiting the Common Case When Accelerating Input-Dependent Stream Processing by FPGA"}, {"paperId": "f1ac75d96c85121f4e0e52ff8c001ac7f3173f8b", "title": "Federated learning for secure IoMT-applications in smart healthcare systems: A comprehensive review"}, {"paperId": "5fdd55c4166c8d5b3c9e5e48238d7b1823225cf1", "title": "Performance Improvement Strategies of Edge-Enabled Social Impact Applications"}, {"paperId": "bdb671d3cb0a08ca9482b3cf6ac6612b859bbf27", "title": "Resource Management in Mobile Edge Computing: A Comprehensive Survey"}, {"paperId": "51a3e715046f3a4528eb84ceb3a77c1a3d21d686", "title": "Real-World Community-in-the-Loop Smart Video Surveillance -
