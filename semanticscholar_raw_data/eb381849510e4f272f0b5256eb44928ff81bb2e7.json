One important challenge in big data processing using Hadoop is proper scheduling of jobs executed in the framework, because correct and optimal execution of jobs hinges upon predicting their execution time. This study aimed at estimating the execution time of jobs. To this end, butterfly optimization algorithm was used to select important job features and the artificial neural network was used for learning. Analyses showed lower error rates for butterfly optimization algorithm compared to Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm, the Spotted Hyena Optimization algorithm, and the Firefly algorithm. Results showed that the value of the objective function for feature selection decreased in the proposed iteration-based method. In order to predict job execution time, the initial population in this method increased, which in turn, reduced the Root Mean Square Error by about 25.85%. The proposed method showed a lower execution time estimation error in comparison to other methods like Multilayer Neural Network, Recursive Neural Network, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2122902784", "name": "Hadi Mollanoori"}, {"authorId": "144072785", "name": "Abolfazl Gandomi"}, {"authorId": "2285897950", "name": "\u06cc\u0631\u0648\u0646\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u06cc\u062f\u0627\u0647"}, {"authorId": "2285918997", "name": "\u06cc\u0645\u062f\u0646\u06af \u0644\u0636\u0641\u0644\u0627\u0648\u0628\u0627"}], "citations": []}
