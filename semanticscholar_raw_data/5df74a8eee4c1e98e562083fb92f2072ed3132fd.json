This virus causes serious respiratory illness and affects several other organs of the body differently for different patient. Worldwide, several waves of this infection have been reported, and researchers/doctors are working hard to develop novel solutions for the COVID diagnosis. Imaging and vision-based techniques are widely explored for the prediction of COVID-19; however, COVID infection percentage estimation is under explored. In this work, we propose a novel framework for the estimation of COVID-19 infection percentage based on deep learning techniques. The proposed network utilizes the features from vision transformers and CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks), specifically EfficientNet-B7. The features of both are fused together for preparing an information-rich feature vector that contributes to a more precise estimation of infection percentage. We evaluate our model on the Per-COVID-19 dataset (Bougourzi et al., 2021b) which comprises labeled CT data of COVID-19 patients. For the evaluation of the model on this dataset, we employ the most widely-used slice-level metrics, i.e., Pearson correlation coefficient (PC), Mean absolute error (MAE), and Root mean square error (RMSE). The network outperforms the other state-of-the-art methods and achieves 0 . 9886 \u00b1 0 . 009 , 1 . 23 \u00b1 0 . 378 , and 3 . 12 \u00b1 1 . 56 , PC, MAE, and RMSE, respectively, using a 5-fold cross-validation technique. In addition, the overall average difference in the actual and predicted infection percentage is observed to be < 2% . In conclusion, the detailed experimental results reveal the robustness and efficiency of the proposed network.", "venue": "", "year": null, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "87712604", "name": "Joohi Chauhan"}, {"authorId": "2175479697", "name": "Jatin Bedi"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "9c71dda80bd4bc204a336fce0dd35b0529ccae08", "title": "A feature extraction and time warping based neural expansion architecture for cloud resource usage forecasting"}, {"paperId": "413ca29fe3b4d04d40bb2f97274c92408304df19", "title": "A TransSE-ResNet Deep Learning Model with Multi-Head Attention Mechanism for Covid-19 Chest CT Image Classification"}]}
