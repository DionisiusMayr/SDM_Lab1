The next step in the evolution of the practical use of AI is the automation of these systems. Since these systems hinge largely on the quality, volume, and careful management of data for training, optimization, and validation of data science models, the promise of AI automation hinges significantly on the ability to efficiently handle data ingestion, ensure real-time processing, and respond swiftly to changes in data.There is a requirement of a multi-faceted approach in terms of data engineering to help practitioners implement automated AI. The need for robust data engineering practices that ensure scalability, efficiency, and reliability in AI applications and their automation is evident. Comprehensive investigations of the impact of these practices on the automation of AI are required to create future-proof, reliable AI systems.This paper will highlight some areas of data engineering that are important for automation of AI, the challenges they pose and the impact they have on performance of AI systems. There is a solution section for each problem that gives the scope of automation and human involvement required along with the tools that are currently being used.", "venue": "2023 International Conference on Computing, Electronics & Communications Engineering (iCCECE)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-08-14", "journal": {"name": "2023 International Conference on Computing, Electronics & Communications Engineering (iCCECE)", "pages": "107-112"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2238039196", "name": "Deexith Reddy"}], "citations": []}
