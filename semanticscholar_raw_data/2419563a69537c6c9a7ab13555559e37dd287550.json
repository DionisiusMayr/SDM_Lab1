To answer this question: we describe the design, implementation, and evaluation of PRIVAPPROX, a data analytics system for privacy-preserving stream processing. PRIVAPPROX provides three properties: (i) Privacy: zero-knowledge privacy guarantees for users, a privacy bound tighter than the state-of-the-art differential privacy; (ii) Utility: an interface for data analysts to systematically explore the trade-offs between the output accuracy (with error-estimation) and query execution budget; (iii) Latency: near real-time stream processing based on a scalable \"synchronization-free\" distributed architecture. The key idea behind our approach is to marry two existing techniques together: namely, sampling (used in the context of approximate computing) and randomized response (used in the context of privacy-preserving analytics). The resulting marriage is complementary - it achieves stronger privacy guarantees and also improves performance, a necessary ingredient for achieving low-latency stream analytics.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2017-01-19", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/1701.05403"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2265023", "name": "D.
