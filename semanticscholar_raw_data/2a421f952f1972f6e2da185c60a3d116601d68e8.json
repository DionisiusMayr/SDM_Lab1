Therefore, a variety of FL frameworks are released to facilitate the development and application of federated learning. Despite the considerable amount of research on the security and privacy of FL models and systems, the security issues in FL frameworks have not been systematically studied yet. In this paper, we conduct the first empirical study on 1,112 FL framework bugs to investigate their characteristics. These bugs are manually collected, classified, and labeled from 12 open-source FL frameworks on GitHub. In detail, we construct taxonomies of 15 symptoms, 12 root causes, and 20 fix patterns of these bugs and investigate their correlations and distributions on 23 logical components and two main application scenarios. From the results of our study, we present nine findings, discuss their implications, and propound several suggestions to FL framework developers and security researchers on the FL frameworks.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2308.05014"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2055088890", "name": "Weijie Shao"}, {"authorId": "2267036905", "name": "Yuyang Gao"}, {"authorId": "2266850562", "name": "Fu Song"}, {"authorId": "2267022815", "name": "Sen Chen"}, {"authorId": "41075481", "name": "Lingling Fan"}], "citations": []}
