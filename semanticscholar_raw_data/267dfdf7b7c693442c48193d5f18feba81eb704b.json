Data Mining (DM) emerges as an important tool for extracting information about energy consumption in databases and identifying consumption patterns. This paper presents a short review on DM, with a focus on the characterization of electricity customers supported on knowledge discovery in database (KDD) process. The study includes several steps: first, few concepts of the KDD process are presented; following, a short review of clustering algorithms is presented including partitional, hierarchical, fuzzy, evolutionary methods, and Self-Organizing Maps; finally, the main concepts and methods for load classification, based on load shape indices are presented. The main objective of this work is to present a short review of DM techniques applied to identify typical load profiles in electrical systems and new customers\u2019 classification.", "venue": "2019 IEEE PES GTD Grand International Conference and Exposition Asia (GTD Asia)", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2019-03-19", "journal": {"name": "2019 IEEE PES GTD Grand International Conference and Exposition Asia (GTD Asia)", "pages": "194-199"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "121497420", "name": "Samuel S.
