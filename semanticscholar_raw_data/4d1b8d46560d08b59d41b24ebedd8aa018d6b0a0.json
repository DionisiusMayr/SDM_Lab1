As the stream processing technology matures and more organizations invest in digital transformations, new applications of stream analytics will be identified and implemented across a wide spectrum of industries. One of the challenges in developing a streaming analytics infrastructure is the difficulty in selecting the right stream processing framework for the different use cases. With a view to addressing this issue, in this paper we present a taxonomy, a comparative study of distributed data stream processing and analytics frameworks, and a critical review of representative open source (Storm, Spark Streaming, Flink, Kafka Streams) and commercial (IBM Streams) distributed data stream processing frameworks. The study also reports our ongoing study on a multilevel streaming analytics architecture that can serve as a guide for organizations and individuals planning to implement a real-time data stream processing and analytics framework.", "venue": "IEEE Access", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2019-10-10", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Access", "pages": "154300-154316", "volume": "7"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "37989093", "name": "Haruna Isah"}, {"authorId": "35700640", "name": "Tariq Abughofa"}, {"authorId": "36835448", "name": "Sazia Mahfuz"}, {"authorId": "1387243832", "name": "Dharmitha Ajerla"}, {"authorId": "1717045", "name": "F.
