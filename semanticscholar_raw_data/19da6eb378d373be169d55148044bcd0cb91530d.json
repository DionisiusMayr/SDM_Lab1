The ongoing development and innovation have also reached various other domains. However, there are still some significant security measures and trust issues that need to be resolved to make the Internet of Things more secure and reliable. Blockchain technology emerged as one potential solution for the security-related goals of IoTs. There has been a growing interest in exploring the potential for integrating blockchain technology with the Internet of Things(IoTs). Blockchain provides distributed immutable ledger that keeps track of transactions done by nodes connected to its network. However, security risks remain, such as the potential inclusion of malicious nodes in the blockchain network. To address this, we propose a method that uses TLS certificates to identify and prevent malicious nodes from joining the blockchain network, ensuring the reliability and security of the distributed ledger.", "venue": "2023 International Conference on Computer, Electronics & Electrical Engineering & their Applications (IC2E3)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-06-08", "journal": {"name": "2023 International Conference on Computer, Electronics & Electrical Engineering & their Applications (IC2E3)", "pages": "1-4"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2248056549", "name": "Shubham Kumar"}, {"authorId": "2248845552", "name": "Shalini Singh"}, {"authorId": "2248407360", "name": "Binod Prasad"}], "citations": []}
