Reported in-cidences of aneurysms range from 5% to > 60% [1]. While of-ten without significant clinical sequela,patients may experience complications such as an inability to dialyze owing to rupture risk and\u2014in rare cases\u2014rupture without warning and with po-tentially catastrophic, life- and limb-threatening consequences [1\u20134]. We developed a novel approach to monitoring of AV aneurysms that builds on the analysis of digital AV access images by a cloud-based deep learning system [5]. We used tablets to take digital images of AV accesses before cannulation in a large and diverse group of hemodialysis patients from 20 dialy-sisclinicsacrosssixUSstates.Theimagesincludedthecannula- tion site and the adjacent skin. A white background was used to enhance contrast. Images were taken with standard resolution and at ambient light. Using a newly developed app, deidentified images were instantaneously uploaded to the cloud in compli-ance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. Images were then adjudicated", "venue": "Clinical Kidney Journal", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-12-16", "journal": {"name": "Clinical Kidney Journal", "pages": "829 - 830", "volume": "15"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "49724027", "name": "Hanjie Zhang"}, {"authorId": "4503391", "name": "D.
