It is typically conducted by parallel processing with a cluster of machines, and is considered a privilege of big companies that can afford the resources. This position paper argues that big data analytics is accessible to small companies with constrained resources. As an evidence, we present BEAS, a framework for querying big relations with constrained resources, based on bounded evaluation and data-driven approximation.", "venue": "", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2017-07-27", "journal": {"name": "Data Analysis and Knowledge Discovery", "pages": "1-7", "volume": "1"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2115994496", "name": "Cao Yang"}, {"authorId": "2264360510", "name": "Wenfei Fan"}, {"authorId": "2057819667", "name": "Tengfei Yuan"}], "citations": []}
