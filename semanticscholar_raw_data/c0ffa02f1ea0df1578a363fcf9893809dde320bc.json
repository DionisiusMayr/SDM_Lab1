The purpose of the study is to develop a SIEM-like (Security Information and Event Management) architecture for offline analysis of DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) archive integrity and users\u2019 activity. To achieve amenable accuracy when validating DICOM archive integrity, two aspects are taken into account: correctness of periodicity of the incoming data stream and correctness of the image data (time series) itself for the considered modality. Validation of users\u2019 activity assumes application of model-driven approaches using state-of-the-art machine learning methods. This paper proposes a network architecture with guard clusters to protect sensitive components like the DICOM archive and application server of the MIS. New server roles were designed to perform traffic interception, data analysis and alert management without reconfiguration of production software components. The cluster architecture allows the analysis of incoming big data streams with high availability, providing horizontal scalability and fault tolerance. To minimize possible harm from spurious DICOM files the approach should be considered as an addition to other securing techniques like watermarking, encrypting and testing data conformance with a standard.", "venue": "Applied Sciences", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2021-02-26", "journal": {"name": "Applied Sciences"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "67038065", "name": "S.
