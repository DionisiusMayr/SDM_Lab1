However, even though it has become ubiquitous, just collecting large-scale social media data involves a high degree of engineering skill set and computational resources. In fact, research is often times gated by data engineering problems that must be overcome before analysis can proceed. This has resulted recognition of datasets as meaningful research contributions in and of themselves.Reddit, the so called \u201cfront page of the Internet,\u201d in particular has been the subject of numerous scientific studies. Although Reddit is relatively open to data acquisition compared to social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, the technical barriers to acquisition still remain. Thus, Reddit's millions of subreddits, hundreds of millions of users, and billions of comments are at the same time relatively accessible, but time consuming to collect and analyze systematically.In this paper, we present the Pushshift Reddit dataset. Pushshift is a social media data collection, analysis, and archiving platform that since 2015 has collected Reddit data and made it available to researchers. Pushshift's Reddit dataset is updated in real-time, and includes historical data back to Reddit's inception. In addition to monthly dumps, Pushshift provides computational tools to aid in searching, aggregating, and performing exploratory analysis on the entirety of the dataset. The Pushshift Reddit dataset makes it possible for social media researchers to reduce time spent in the data collection, cleaning, and storage phases of their projects.", "venue": "International Conference on Web and Social Media", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-01-23", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2001.08435"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2058611087", "name": "Jason Baumgartner"}, {"authorId": "3447293", "name": "Savvas Zannettou"}, {"authorId": "145832870", "name": "Brian Keegan"}, {"authorId": "3314746", "name": "Megan Squire"}, {"authorId": "144728530", "name": "Jeremy Blackburn"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "fe498a23171656ac57297956fd557e21586f02ed", "title": "Predicting the Performance of Foundation Models via Agreement-on-the-Line"}, {"paperId": "0ef96db48c716188120d7d23020a2a154e3bc119", "title": "A Holistic Indicator of Polarization to Measure Online Sexism"}, {"paperId": "3c448b8dbd00d459e4b5b861302a2ce2398faa7c", "title": "Semantic change and socio-semantic variation: the case of COVID-related neologisms on Reddit"}, {"paperId": "097d26af3bd536537a9a679ca5e0156082e9ebf5", "title": "Can Large Language Models Identify Authorship?"}, {"paperId": "e33bd615b021ba90f87e02c036c3acae834d3893", "title": "Authorship Style Transfer with Policy Optimization"}, {"paperId": "4b1b52a631ec3aed6185aef5cee8cd34fd50dcab", "title": "Hybrid Human-LLM Corpus Construction and LLM Evaluation for Rare Linguistic Phenomena"}, {"paperId": "99a24c7f52625d5add31994268fa49cb8ddab620", "title": "Hierarchical graph fusion network and a new argumentative dataset for multiparty dialogue discourse parsing"}, {"paperId": "7644d9053eaa314dc5b439d15bb8a5cb1a393b79", "title": "Contrastive Hawkes graph neural networks with dynamic sampling for event prediction"}, {"paperId": "91b1d4b727be7fe2933a1b840f6eac0497ae7907", "title": "Clustering polycystic ovary syndrome laboratory results extracted from a large internet forum with machine learning"}, {"paperId": "38f4f27bfdc6cdc4c72d714a097541f1e6ca98f2", "title": "Inductive Graph Alignment Prompt: Bridging the Gap between Graph Pre-training and Inductive Fine-tuning From Spectral Perspective"}, {"paperId": "7418519415c830d876d0059d59df718eeb0babdc", "title": "Applying Named Entity Recognition and Graph Networks to Extract Common Interests from Thematic Subfora on Reddit"}, {"paperId": "1e81de58a48dd540e014eb0a80af619a0c899c31", "title": "Amplifying Training Data Exposure through Fine-Tuning with Pseudo-Labeled Memberships"}, {"paperId": "7798dc4f3fd72807d90219df0b95407a174be29a", "title": "Studying Differential Mental Health Expressions in India"}, {"paperId": "08436b3ddafd2edc798753ebc87f6ceffed6e8df", "title": "KnowTuning: Knowledge-aware Fine-tuning for Large Language Models"}, {"paperId": "81738232a8275b65cba357150a50b1856c6f97fe", "title": "Eliciting Personality Traits in Large Language Models"}, {"paperId": "8c93ba189dcab521acc2235beda592c0a89a6f2e", "title": "Teleoscope: Exploring Themes in Large Document Sets By Example"}, {"paperId": "13876ab6fb7ae5c778c787c17d9597624aedd2c1", "title": "A Longitudinal Study of Italian and French Reddit Conversations Around the Russian Invasion of Ukraine"}, {"paperId": "b88b25aba67d7a391eb480563fbfd5b4a6625444", "title": "Long Is More for Alignment: A Simple but Tough-to-Beat Baseline for Instruction Fine-Tuning"}, {"paperId": "1a524ddd684c9ac546183c5b0d6b67f7f7003817", "title": "Attention Allocation of Investors on Social Media: The Role of Prospect Theory"}, {"paperId": "d456a1b018616e9ffb1abc3a4ff250b99e1871ed", "title": "How do medical professionals make sense (or not) of AI?
