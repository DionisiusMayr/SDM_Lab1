The fundamental inspiration of the proposed SABO is to use the subtraction average of searcher agents to update the position of population members in the search space. The different steps of the SABO\u2019s implementation are described and then mathematically modeled for optimization tasks. The performance of the proposed SABO approach is tested for the optimization of fifty-two standard benchmark functions, consisting of unimodal, high-dimensional multimodal, and fixed-dimensional multimodal types, and the CEC 2017 test suite. The optimization results show that the proposed SABO approach effectively solves the optimization problems by balancing the exploration and exploitation in the search process of the problem-solving space. The results of the SABO are compared with the performance of twelve well-known metaheuristic algorithms. The analysis of the simulation results shows that the proposed SABO approach provides superior results for most of the benchmark functions. Furthermore, it provides a much more competitive and outstanding performance than its competitor algorithms. Additionally, the proposed approach is implemented for four engineering design problems to evaluate the SABO in handling optimization tasks for real-world applications. The optimization results show that the proposed SABO approach can solve for real-world applications and provides more optimal designs than its competitor algorithms.", "venue": "Biomimetics", "year":
