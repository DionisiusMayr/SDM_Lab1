The unsupervised Dirichlet Process (DP) and the supervised Support Vector Machine (SVM) techniques can be executed for mapping hydrothermal alteration zones associated with porphyry copper deposits. The main objective of this investigation is to practice an algorithm that can accurately model the best training data as input for supervised methods such as SVM. For this purpose, the Zefreh porphyry copper deposit located in the Urumieh-Dokhtar Magmatic Arc (UDMA) of central Iran was selected and used as training data. Initially, using ASTER data, different alteration zones of the Zefreh porphyry copper deposit were detected by Band Ratio, Relative Band Depth (RBD), Linear Spectral Unmixing (LSU), Spectral Feature Fitting (SFF), and Orthogonal Subspace Projection (OSP) techniques. Then, using the DP method, the exact extent of each alteration was determined. Finally, the detected alterations were used as training data to identify similar alteration zones in full scene of ASTER using SVM and Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) methods. Several high potential zones were identified in the study area. Field surveys and laboratory analysis were used to validate the image processing results. This investigation demonstrates that the application of the SVM algorithm for mapping hydrothermal alteration zones associated with porphyry copper deposits is broadly applicable to ASTER data and can be used for prospectivity mapping in many metallogenic provinces around the world.", "venue": "Minerals", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2021-11-06", "journal": {"name": "Minerals"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2141576163", "name": "Mastoureh Yousefi"}, {"authorId": "104912030", "name": "S.
