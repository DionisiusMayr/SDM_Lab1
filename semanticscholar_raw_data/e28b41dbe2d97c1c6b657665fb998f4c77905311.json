The focal point is the utilization of the Bi-modal Transformer (BMT) model and the Vid2Seq model for video captioning, employing the UCF Crime dataset for experimentation. By employing various LLMs such as GPT3.5, GPT4, and LLAMA, the objective is to create an efficient search system that can pinpoint specific moments within videos. The paper outlines a methodology involving the generation of text-based captions using the BMT and Vid2Seq model. Furthermore, it conducts experiments using different LLMs and prompts, with evaluation metrics defined to assess system performance and event occurrence accuracy. The findings acquired provide insights into the capabilities and constraints of LLMs and prompts, illustrating their potential to enhance video captioning and transform video search functionalities. This research makes a valuable contribution by exploring LLM-based video querying techniques and their potential to improve video search efficiency.", "venue": "2023 7th International Conference on Computer Applications in Electrical Engineering-Recent Advances (CERA)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-10-27", "journal": {"name": "2023 7th International Conference on Computer Applications in Electrical Engineering-Recent Advances (CERA)", "pages": "1-6"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2290081213", "name": "Ameya G.
