This steady adoption has led to a significant increase in the number and volume of available RDF datasets, exceeding the capabilities of traditional RDF stores. This scenario has introduced severe big semantic data challenges when it comes to managing and querying RDF data at Web scale. Despite the existence of various off-the-shelf Big Data platforms, processing RDF in a distributed environment remains a significant challenge. In this position paper, based on an in-depth analysis of the state of the art, we propose to manage large RDF datasets in Flink, a well-known scalable distributed Big Data processing framework.", "venue": "International Conference on Big Data Innovations and Applications", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2018-08-01", "journal": {"name": "2018 4th International Conference on Big Data Innovations and Applications (Innovate-Data)", "pages": "9-16"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "20829758", "name": "Amr Azzam"}, {"authorId": "2601335", "name": "S.
