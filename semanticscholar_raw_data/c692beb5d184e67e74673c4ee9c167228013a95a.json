Performance is a critical component in the cloud environment concerning constraints like economic, time, and hardware issues. Various characteristics and conditions for providing solutions and designing strategies must be dealt with in different situations to perform better. For example, task scheduling and resource allocation are significant challenges in cloud management. Adopting proper techniques in such conditions leads to performance improvement. This paper surveys existing scheduling algorithms concerning the macro design idea. We classify these algorithms into four main categories: deterministic algorithms, metaheuristic algorithms, learning algorithms, and algorithms based on game theory. Each category is discussed by citing appropriate studies, and the MapReduce review is addressed as an example.", "venue": "Multiagent and Grid Systems", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-08-30", "journal": {"name": "Multiagent Grid Syst.", "pages": "119-148", "volume": "18"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2757572", "name": "M.
