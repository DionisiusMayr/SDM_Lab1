Scaling video analytics to massive camera deployments, however, presents a new and mounting challenge, as compute cost grows proportionally to the number of camera feeds. This paper is driven by a simple question: can we scale video analytics in such a way that cost grows sublinearly, or even remains constant, as we deploy more cameras, while inference accuracy remains stable, or even improves. We believe the answer is yes. Our key observation is that video feeds from wide-area camera deployments demonstrate significant content correlations (e.g. to other geographically proximate feeds), both in space and over time. These spatio-temporal correlations can be harnessed to dramatically reduce the size of the inference search space, decreasing both workload and false positive rates in multi-camera video analytics. By discussing use-cases and technical challenges, we propose a roadmap for scaling video analytics to large camera networks, and outline a plan for its realization.", "venue": "Workshop on Mobile Computing Systems and Applications", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2018-09-07", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 20th International Workshop on Mobile Computing Systems and Applications"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "40896248", "name": "Samvit Jain"}, {"authorId": "2849491", "name": "Ganesh Ananthanarayanan"}, {"authorId": "1727978", "name": "Junchen Jiang"}, {"authorId": "39596641", "name": "Yuanchao Shu"}, {"authorId": "49988044", "name": "Joseph E.
