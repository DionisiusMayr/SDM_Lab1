The increased reliance on technology to drive daily lives of people is the main reason why many believe that smart technology is a major part of intelligent cities. By design, intelligent cities are heavily reliant on connected devices. Consequently, reliance on technology poses the risk that any disruption of technology-based services may put human lives in danger. In this context, attacks on technological frameworks can mean attacks on the entire city. Unfortunately, there is no existing technology that is able to successfully defend against such cyberattacks. In this research, the authors review the concepts, principles, and technologies, and propose an approach for a cyber defence system, based on artificial intelligence and machine learning, to detect and prevent an integrated cyberattack.", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "", "pages": "271-299", "volume": ""}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2014023404", "name": "Jared Piconi"}, {"authorId": "1399714285", "name": "Omaru Maruatona"}, {"authorId": "46201673", "name": "Alex Ng"}, {"authorId": "144366819", "name": "A.
