More speci\ufb01cally, we intend to predict grades of a student for future exams, based on his/her previous results and the past grades received by all students from the same series/group. We have tried several machine learning methods for predicting future student grades, and \ufb01nally we obtained good results, namely a mean absolute prediction error smaller than 1. The best variant proved to be the one based on neural networks that leads to a mean absolute prediction error smaller than 0.5. These results show the practical applicability of our proposed methodology, and consequently, we built, based on these, a practical recommendation system available to students as a web application.", "venue": "International Conference on Agents and Artificial Intelligence", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"pages": "285-292"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "52259206", "name": "H.
