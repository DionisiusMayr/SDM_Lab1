During this process, users can switch between different sessions. Mobile networks are designed with this as one of their key focuses. People have noted that call dropping occurs as a result of latency whenever there is a significant amount of activity involving handovers. The amount of work that needs to be done by HMM is related to the magnitude of the RSS characteristics, while the accuracy of the predictions that are created is dependent on the amount of time that has elapsed since the predictions were first made. The simulation is conducted in matlab to show the efficacy of the proposed handover model over various models. The results of simulation shows that the proposed method achieves higher rate of accuracy than other methods.", "venue": "International Conference on Database Theory", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-05-11", "journal": {"name": "2023 International Conference on Disruptive Technologies (ICDT)", "pages": "51-56"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2289011433", "name": "Dr. V.
