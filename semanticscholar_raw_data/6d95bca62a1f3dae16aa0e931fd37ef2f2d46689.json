This optimization produces a more efficient computation that preserves the soundness and completeness for the predicates specified by the integrity constraints. Complex algorithms, including greedy algorithms, can now be specified via simpler programs that are stratified with respect to min and max, and then implemented via optimized rules that use these aggregates in the seminaive fixpoint computation to achieve more efficient execution. This rewriting is not limited to extrema, but in many situations a similar optimization is applicable to other constraints as well. The relationships of this optimization technique with recent works on monotonic aggregates and their combined efficient implementation in the seminaive fixpoint method are also elucidated.", "venue": "", "year": 2016, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "", "volume": ""}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1712630", "name": "C.
