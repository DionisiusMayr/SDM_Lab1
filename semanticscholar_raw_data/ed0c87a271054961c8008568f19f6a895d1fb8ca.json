Since developing ML applications requires multidisciplinary effort, it is important to eliminate knowledge mismatch about security among the team members in the early design phase. In this paper, we present a collection of security patterns for the data-oriented stages in the ML workflow, including data collection, data storage, and data preparation. This provides a concise guidance on how to protect each stage from known threats, as well as a communication vocabulary for different roles to consider security without being security experts.", "venue": "European Conference on Pattern Languages of Programs", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book"], "publicationDate": "2022-07-06", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 27th European Conference on Pattern Languages of Programs"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2137413528", "name": "Xinrui Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2197680", "name": "Jason Jaskolka"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "9bcf2ccd4f0bad390a463d53fe45eed2b98bceaf", "title": "Conceptualizing the Secure Machine Learning Operations (SecMLOps) Paradigm"}]}
