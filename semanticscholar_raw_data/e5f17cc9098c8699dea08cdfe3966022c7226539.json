The traditional interpretation methods, heavily reliant on human interpretation, are replaced with a more reliable deep-learning-based methodology. We explored the enhancement of model accuracy via transfer learning and scrutinized the influence of three distinct pre-training datasets on the model\u2019s performance. The results indicate that GoogleNet facilitated effective identification, with accuracy and precision rates exceeding 90%. Furthermore, pre-training with the ImageNet dataset increased prediction accuracy by about 10% compared to the model without pre-training. The model\u2019s prediction ability was best promoted by pre-training datasets in the following order: Marine-PULSE \u2265 ImageNet > SeabedObjects-KLSG. Our study shows that pre-training dataset categories, dataset volume, and data consistency with predicted data are crucial factors affecting pre-training outcomes. These findings set the stage for future research on automatic pipeline detection using deep learning techniques and emphasize the significance of suitable pre-training dataset selection for CNN models.", "venue": "Remote Sensing", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-10-08", "journal": {"name": "Remote.
