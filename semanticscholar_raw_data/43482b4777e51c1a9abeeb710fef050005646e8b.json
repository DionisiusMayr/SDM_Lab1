However, manufacturing corporations are facing a data tsunami which brings new challenges to predictive maintenance (PdM). In recent years, many approaches and architecture for predictive maintenance have been proposed to solve some of these problems to varying degrees. This paper introduces a general framework based on the Internet of Things, cloud computing and big data analytics for PdM of industrial equipment. In this framework, smart sensors are installed on the device to obtain electrical data, which is then encrypted and uploaded to the cloud platform to predict the health condition by deep learning methods. Several working instances including feature selection, feature fusion, and Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction are provided. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated by real-world cases.", "venue": "Journal of Physics: Conference Series", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Physics"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2021-11-01", "journal": {"name": "Journal of Physics: Conference Series", "volume": "2083"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2142838985", "name": "Kun Pan"}, {"authorId": "50262160", "name": "Yuchen Jiang"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "e77bd8b6205ec28eb3291fd023ae66dea2bfa372", "title": "Research on cloud computing resource scheduling based on improved ant colony optimization algorithm"}]}
