To face this global problem, a better knowledge about these diseases becomes crucial to characterize chronic patients. Our aim is two-fold: (1) to provide an efficient visual tool for identifying clinical patterns in high-dimensional data; and (2) to characterize the patient health-status through a data-driven approach using electronic health records of healthy, hypertensive and diabetic populations. We propose a two-stage methodology that uses diagnosis and drug codes of healthy and chronic patients associated to the University Hospital of Fuenlabrada in Spain. The first stage applies the Self-Organizing Map on the aforementioned data to get a set of prototype patients which are projected onto a grid of nodes. Each node has associated a prototype patient that captures relationships among clinical characteristics. In the second stage, clustering methods are applied on the prototype patients to find groups of patients with a similar health-status. Clusters with distinctive patterns linked to chronic conditions were found, being the most remarkable highlights: a cluster of pregnant women emerged among the hypertensive population, and two clusters of diabetic individuals with significant differences in drug-therapy (insulin and non-insulin dependant). The proposed methodology showed to be effective to explore relationships within clinical data and to find patterns related to diabetes and hypertension in a visual way. Our methodology raises as a suitable alternative for building appropriate clinical groups, becoming a promising approach to be applied to any population due to its data-driven philosophy. A thorough analysis of these groups could spawn new and fruitful findings.", "venue": "IEEE Access", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Psychology"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-07-27", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Access", "pages": "137019-137031", "volume": "8"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1879302232", "name": "David Chushig-Muzo"}, {"authorId": "1397324826", "name": "C.
