Our life and research environment have continually evolved, often accompanied by controversial opinions about new methodologies. In this paper, we embrace this change by introducing a new approach to qualitative analysis in HCI using Large Language Models (LLMs). We detail a method that uses LLMs for qualitative data analysis and present a quantitative framework using SBART cosine similarity for performance evaluation. Our findings indicate that LLMs not only match the efficacy of traditional analysis methods but also offer unique insights. Through a novel dataset and benchmark, we explore LLMs' characteristics in HCI research, suggesting potential avenues for further exploration and application in the field.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-01-07", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2401.04138"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2172227262", "name": "M.
