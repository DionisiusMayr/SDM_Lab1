A description of the designed information-technology platform for telemetry accounting of water, heat, gas and electricity consumption aimed at the implementation in the \u201cSmart cities\u201d projects is presented. The basic version of the offered platform uses several generations of digital devices for transmiting telemetry data with the ability of Internet connection by means of network interfaces (LANs) and mobile networks. It is suggested to combine the technology of Internet devices and BigData in order to analyze and process a large number of data sets collected from heterogeneous sources, which in turn are characterized by weak structuring and high speed of updating.", "venue": "International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technologies", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2018-09-01", "journal": {"name": "2018 IEEE 13th International Scientific and Technical Conference on Computer Sciences and Information Technologies (CSIT)", "pages": "72-75", "volume": "2"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "51930110", "name": "Duda Oleksii"}, {"authorId": "51933926", "name": "M.
