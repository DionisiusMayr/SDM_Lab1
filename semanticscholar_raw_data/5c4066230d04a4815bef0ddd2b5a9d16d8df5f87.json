Several studies demonstrated that FA could successfully deal with several engineering and theoretical optimization problems. Nevertheless, there are some weak points in FA, such as parameter dependence and high computational complexity. To overcome the above issues, this paper proposes a modified FA based on neighborhood search (MFANS). In MFANS, there are three modifications. First, a modified attraction strategy is employed to reduce the complexity. Then, a neighborhood search method is used to search around the best neighborhood solutions. Third, the step parameter is dynamically adjusted. Performance of MFANS is compared with two improved FAs. Results show the effectiveness of MFANS.", "venue": "Concurrency and Computation", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-10-26", "journal": {"name": "Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience", "volume": "33"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "145786165", "name": "Gan Yu"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "37c99cd4dd6bec83906a72ec7abc3d42fac5f81f", "title": "Modified Firefly Optimization Algorithm-Based IDS for Nature-Inspired Cybersecurity"}, {"paperId": "bf0b8f10059865e2aa99ca1aecd3311cfd2ea245", "title": "Quantum firefly algorithm with stochastic search strategies"}, {"paperId": "fbee5ec541400fe38d6223eeb76de662b9f0e139", "title": "Enhancing Firefly Algorithm with Dual-Population Topology Coevolution"}, {"paperId": "47107d4a01a0730f3cf2de7401dee3c5ced6333d", "title": "An advanced hybrid algorithm for nonlinear function optimization with real world applications"}, {"paperId": "3c50db3f6199ba4461d8224e8f2623e2ee6c98ae", "title": "An efficient firefly algorithm based on modified search strategy and neighborhood attraction"}]}
