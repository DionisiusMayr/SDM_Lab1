Different data query patterns have been evaluated. Cloudera\u2019s open-source Apache Hadoop distribution CDH 5.4 has been chosen for the experiments presented in this article. The results show that compact data formats (Avro and Parquet) take up less storage space when compared with plain text data formats because of binary data format and compression advantage. Furthermore, data queries from the column based data format Parquet are faster when compared with text data formats and Avro.", "venue": "", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2017-07-04", "journal": {"name": "Mokslas - Lietuvos Ateitis", "pages": "267-276", "volume": "9"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "31327689", "name": "Daiga Plase"}, {"authorId": "2047176", "name": "Laila Niedrite"}, {"authorId": "1944120", "name": "R.
