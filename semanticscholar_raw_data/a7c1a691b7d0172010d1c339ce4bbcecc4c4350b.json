Besides, the incorporation of automatic inventory and replenishment systems \u2013 that hospitals are undertaking \u2013 requires developed and accurate forecasting systems. Researchers propose different artificial intelligence (AI)-based forecasting models to predict hospital assets consumption (AC) for everyday activity case and prove that AI-based models generally outperform many forecasting models in this framework. The purpose of this paper is to identify the appropriate AI-based forecasting model(s) for predicting hospital AC under disruptive incidents to improve hospitals' response to disasters/pandemics situations.Design/methodology/approachThe authors select the appropriate AI-based forecasting models according to the deduced criteria from hospitals' framework analysis under disruptive incidents. Artificial neural network (ANN), recurrent neural network (RNN), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and learning-FIS (FIS with learning algorithms) are generally compliant with the criteria among many AI-based forecasting methods. Therefore, the authors evaluate their accuracy to predict a university hospital AC under a burn mass casualty incident.FindingsThe ANFIS model is the most compliant with the extracted criteria (autonomous learning capability, fast response, real-time control and interpretability) and provides the best accuracy (the average accuracy is 98.46%) comparing to the other models.Originality/valueThis work contributes to developing accurate forecasting systems for hospitals under disruptive incidents to improve their response to disasters/pandemics situations.", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2021-05-27", "journal": {"name": "", "volume": ""}, "authors": [{"authorId": "8672006", "name": "Sara Jebbor"}, {"authorId": "2121091624", "name": "Chiheb Raddouane"}, {"authorId": "9427498", "name": "Abdellatif El Afia"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "a779f5dd28c8aaab0e1bdceeb6700f17d655c0a4", "title": "The Role of AI in Hospitals and Clinics: Transforming Healthcare in the 21st Century"}, {"paperId": "a33bf4f63911a2a4942cc6a3b306fa9595289477", "title": "A multi-MLP prediction for inventory management in manufacturing execution system"}, {"paperId": "09d257061fa23478155a9ec54ba08bd7df2e26fd", "title": "Demand Forecasting in Retail for Diabetes Medicine"}, {"paperId": "be6e6d5478bd73f2e11bbce379d2ce44b4c03783", "title": "Guest editorial: The COVID-19 impact on humanitarian operations: lessons for future disrupting events"}]}
