This combination has led to the development of a variety of SQL-on-Hadoop systems that are in use today. While the various SQL-on-Hadoop systems target the same class of analytical workloads, their different architectures, design decisions and implementations impact query performance. In this work, we perform a comparative analysis of four state-of-the-art SQL-on-Hadoop systems (Impala, Drill, Spark SQL and Phoenix) using the Web Data Analytics micro benchmark and the TPC-H benchmark on the Amazon EC2 cloud platform. The TPC-H experiment results show that, although Impala outperforms other systems (4.41x\u20136.65x) in the text format, trade-offs exists in the parquet format, with each system performing best on subsets of queries. A comprehensive analysis of execution profiles expands upon the performance results to provide insights into performance variations, performance bottlenecks and query execution characteristics.", "venue": "2017 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2017-12-01", "journal": {"name": "2017 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "pages": "1349-1356"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2786856", "name": "A.
