Our own research identified a new class of software bugs called energy bugs [1-4] that cause mobile software to quickly drain battery. We built and released numerous tools to detect and mitigate these bugs [2,4,5]. We also suggested energy optimizations in the OS; for instance, OS can suppress activities of background apps that are not being opened by the user [6].", "venue": "Proceedings of the 26th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2020-04-16", "journal": {"name": "GetMobile: Mobile Computing and Communications", "pages": "5 - 8", "volume": "26"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2112116341", "name": "Mingliang Li"}, {"authorId": "2152782112", "name": "Hao Lin"}, {"authorId": "2116905759", "name": "Cai Liu"}, {"authorId": "2110122923", "name": "Zhenhua Li"}, {"authorId": "2053324508", "name": "Feng Qian"}, {"authorId": "2051647248", "name": "Yunhao Liu"}, {"authorId": "2056680846", "name": "N.
