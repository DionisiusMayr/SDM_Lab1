In the article, we conducted a study on students\u2019 learning behavior analysis and student performance prediction based on the data about students\u2019 behavior logs in three consecutive years of blended teaching in a college\u2019s \u201cJava Language Programming\u201d course. Firstly, the data from diverse platforms such as MOOC, Rain Classroom, PTA, and cnBlog are integrated and preprocessed. Secondly, a novel multiclass classification framework, combining the genetic algorithm (GA) and the error correcting output codes (ECOC) method, is developed to predict the grade levels of students. In the framework, GA is designed to realize both the feature selection and binary classifier selection to fit the ECOC models. Finally, key factors affecting grades are identified in line with the optimal subset of features selected by GA, which can be analyzed for teaching significance. The results show that the multiclass classification algorithm designed in this article can effectively predict grades compared with other algorithms. In addition, the selected subset of features corresponding to learning behaviors is pedagogically instructive.", "venue": "Scientific Programming", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-08-20", "journal": {"name": "Sci.
