This has paved a new paradigm in information processing for the consumers. Due to cloud\u2019s inherent characteristics, most service providers shift to the cloud and its data centers. To retain cloud service reliability, it\u2019s essential to carry out the minimum latency tasks and cost-effectively. Various techniques to improve performance and use of assets are focused on load control, task management, resource management, service quality, and workload management. Data load balancing helps data centers to avoid overload/underload of virtual machines, a difficulty in the world of cloud computing. This study reports a state-of-the-art analysis of current load balancing approaches, problems, and complexities to design more successful algorithms.", "venue": "International Journal of Information Retrieval Research", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "Int.
