Since the nodes in UWSNs are restricted to inbuilt batteries, the effective utilization of available energy becomes essential. Clustering and routing approaches can be employed as energy-efficient solutions for UWSNs. However, the cluster-based routing techniques developed for conventional wireless networks cannot be employed for a UWSN because of the low bandwidth, spread stay, underwater current, and error probability. To resolve these issues, this article introduces a novel chaotic search-and-rescue-optimization-based multi-hop data transmission (CSRO-MHDT) protocol for UWSNs. When using the CSRO-MHDT technique, cluster headers (CHs) are selected and clusters are prearranged, rendering a range of features, including remaining energy, intracluster distance, and intercluster detachment. Additionally, the chaotic search and rescue optimization (CSRO) algorithm is discussed, which is created by incorporating chaotic notions into the classic search and rescue optimization (SRO) algorithm. In addition, the CSRO-MHDT approach calculates a fitness function that takes residual energy, distance, and node degree into account, among other factors. A distinctive aspect of the paper is demonstrated by the development of the CSRO algorithm for route optimization, which was developed in-house. To validate the success of the CSRO-MHDT method, a sequence of tests were carried out, and the results showed the CSRO-MHDT method to have a packet delivery ratio (PDR) of 88%, whereas the energy-efficient clustering routing protocol (EECRP), the fuzzy C-means and moth\u2013flame optimization (FCMMFO), the fuzzy scheme and particle swarm optimization (FBCPSO), the energy-efficient grid routing based on 3D cubes (EGRC), and the low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy based on expected residual energy (LEACH-ERE) methods have reached lesser PDRs of 83%, 81%, 78%, 77%, and 75%, respectively, for 1000 rounds. The CSRO-MHDT technique resulted in higher values of number of packets received (NPR) under all rounds. For instance, with 50 rounds, the CSRO-MHDT technique attained a higher NPR of 3792%.", "venue": "Italian National Conference on Sensors", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-04-01", "journal": {"name": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "volume": "22"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "40022063", "name": "D.
