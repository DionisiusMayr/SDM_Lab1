The RCDS problem is NP-hard. To facilitate solving, presolving and problem reduction techniques are developed. In addition, three integer program formulations are obtained using single commodity flow, Dantzig\u2013Fulkerson\u2013Johnson and Miller\u2013Tucker\u2013Zemlin ideas to enforce graph connectedness. For a realistic power network repository (MATPOWER 7) including graphs with 70k nodes, our presolving and reduction procedures simplify problem instances to on average 30% of the original sizes. All reduced instances, when modeled by our formulations, can be solved with optimality gap less than 0.5% within 20 min using a PC with Gurobi 9.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Control of Network Systems", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-12-01", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Transactions on Control of Network Systems", "pages": "1780-1792", "volume": "9"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "34988240", "name": "K.
