Adapting the Quality of Result allows for targeted processing times by selecting various approximations. Feature models can be employed to manage the resulting multitude of possible configurations. However, the deployment and (re)-configuration process is very time-consuming, making it impractical for mission-critical applications. In this work, we introduce a processing pipeline with components that significantly accelerate online (re)-configuration based on changing latencies compared to the state-of-the-art. Additionally, we address the edge-specific discovery of potential microservice chains capable of executing the application.", "venue": "IFIP International Information Security Conference", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-12-06", "journal": {"name": "2023 IEEE/ACM Symposium on Edge Computing (SEC)", "pages": "264-266"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2283153969", "name": "Uwe Gropengie\u00dfer"}, {"authorId": "2283151389", "name": "Julian Liphardt"}, {"authorId": "2283151399", "name": "Michael Matth\u00e9"}, {"authorId": "2270533626", "name": "Max M\u00fchlh\u00e4user"}], "citations": []}
