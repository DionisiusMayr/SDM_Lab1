This paper proposes two improved multiplier designs based on a new 4:2 approximate compressor circuit to simplify the hardware at the partial product reduction stage. The proposed multiplier designs are targeted towards error-tolerant applications. Exhaustive error and hardware analysis has been carried out on the existing and proposed multiplier designs. The results prove that the proposed approximate multiplier architecture performs better than the existing architectures without significant compromise on quality metrics. Experimental results show that die-area and power consumed are reduced upto 28%, and 25.29% respectively in comparison with the existing designs without significant compromise on accuracy.", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2021-08-01", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering", "pages": "2953-2961", "volume": "11"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2006673948", "name": "U.
