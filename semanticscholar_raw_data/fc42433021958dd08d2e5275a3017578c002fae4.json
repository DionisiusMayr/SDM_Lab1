Therefore, this research is focused on evaluating and comparing widely-used database systems that are employed in the analysis of spatio-temporal data. Specifically, three database systems are evaluated and compared with each other, namely PostGIS, MobilityDB, and MongoDB, in their ability to perform range, temporal aggregate, distance and nearest-neighbor queries. To this end, a subset of the BerlinMOD benchmark queries is employed for evaluation purposes over vessel tracking data. The experimental results presented in this paper are only preliminary in an attempt to drive future research in the field of industrial use case surveillance.", "venue": "International Conference on Mobile Data Management", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-06-01", "journal": {"name": "2022 23rd IEEE International Conference on Mobile Data Management (MDM)", "pages": "388-393"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3415310", "name": "Ioannis Kontopoulos"}, {"authorId": "50526299", "name": "Antonios Makris"}, {"authorId": "2182908446", "name": "Stylianos Nektarios Xyalis"}, {"authorId": "1771972", "name": "K.
