However, graph analytics applications suffer from poor locality, limited bandwidth, and low parallelism owing to the irregular sparse structure, explosive growth, and dependencies of graph data. To address those challenges, several programming models, execution modes, and messaging strategies are proposed to improve the utilization of traditional hardware and performance. In recent years, novel computing and memory devices have emerged, e.g., HMCs, HBM, and ReRAM, providing massive bandwidth and parallelism resources, making it possible to address bottlenecks in graph applications. To facilitate understanding of the graph analytics domain, our study summarizes and categorizes current software systems implementation and domain-specific architectures. Finally, we discuss the future challenges of graph analytics.", "venue": "Intelligent Computing", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-10-29", "journal": {"name": "Intelligent Computing"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "145914251", "name": "Hai Jin"}, {"authorId": "2189329751", "name": "Hao Qi"}, {"authorId": "2109972322", "name": "Jin Zhao"}, {"authorId": "2161256436", "name": "Xinyu Jiang"}, {"authorId": "2108860901", "name": "Yu Huang"}, {"authorId": "73767790", "name": "Chuangyi Gui"}, {"authorId": "2109183880", "name": "Qinggang Wang"}, {"authorId": "3234791", "name": "Xinyang Shen"}, {"authorId": "2206397280", "name": "Yi Zhang"}, {"authorId": "1842300439", "name": "Ao Hu"}, {"authorId": "2182623372", "name": "Dan Chen"}, {"authorId": "2152505362", "name": "Chao Liu"}, {"authorId": "2177399757", "name": "Haifeng Liu"}, {"authorId": "2176647706", "name": "Haiheng He"}, {"authorId": "2147245034", "name": "Xiangyu Ye"}, {"authorId": "2128117199", "name": "Runze Wang"}, {"authorId": "2165688103", "name": "Jingrui Yuan"}, {"authorId": "2099667639", "name": "Pengcheng Yao"}, {"authorId": "72095113", "name": "Yu Zhang"}, {"authorId": "9135861", "name": "Long Zheng"}, {"authorId": "144925807", "name": "Xiaofei Liao"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "d9f1ae12e9a9d5b8eec465b4127285bae265112b", "title": "GraphTune: An Efficient Dependency-Aware Substrate to Alleviate Irregularity in Concurrent Graph Processing"}, {"paperId": "6cb7dee7e24a0bc77e7b10412d21e9ac501a46b2", "title": "Towards a Protein-Protein Interactions Framework using Graph Analytics on Apache Spark"}]}
