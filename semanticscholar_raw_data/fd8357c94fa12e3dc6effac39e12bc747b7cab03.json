In this paper, we analyze Reddit\u2019s previous administrative interventions to understand one aspect of this dilemma: the relationship between the media and administrative interventions. More specifically, we make two primary contributions. First, using a mediation analysis framework, we find evidence that Reddit\u2019s interventions for violating their content policy for toxic content occur because of media pressure. Second, using interrupted time series analysis, we show that media attention on communities with toxic content only increases the problematic behavior associated with that community (both within the community itself and across the platform). However, we find no significant difference in the impact of administrative interventions on subreddits with and without media pressure. Taken all together, this study provides evidence of a media-driven moderation strategy at Reddit and also suggests that such a strategy may not have a significantly different impact than a more proactive strategy.", "venue": "International Conference on Web and Social Media", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-10-29", "journal": {"pages": "275-286"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "146891136", "name": "Hussam Habib"}, {"authorId": "2405355", "name": "Rishab Nithyanand"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "de82c0e640646086a462b2fca99a82625c60cc1d", "title": "Sadness, Anger, or Anxiety: Twitter Users' Emotional Responses to Toxicity in Public Conversations"}, {"paperId": "8688fcb4cf38ff01af9d6d19f9b3b571c0cd74a4", "title": "The Dark Threads That Weave the Web of Shame: A Network Science-Inspired Analysis of Body Shaming on Reddit"}, {"paperId": "0b4637c42260a3b7e966dbb671f01b2789dc69fc", "title": "Towards Intersectional Moderation: An Alternative Model of Moderation Built on Care and Power"}, {"paperId": "dc4abd75cb5e9a07b2533cf588bc5da41c131981", "title": "A Study of Slang Representation Methods"}, {"paperId": "de7dbffe5622ada1b83e80a4fbae34375771d4f9", "title": "Multimodal and Explainable Internet Meme Classification"}, {"paperId": "4a7bb730127b5148a9c0144359bd862e42968fc8", "title": "Nobody Wants to Work Anymore: An Analysis of r/antiwork and the Interplay between Social and Mainstream Media during the Great Resignation"}, {"paperId": "160762eaab73ef24bc15668e13fcf836735fe45e", "title": "Explainable Classification of Internet Memes"}, {"paperId": "da67c1bcd7c5cf9530a4294ab44379ff240b0d5b", "title": "Fighting Misinformation on Social Media: An Empirical Investigation of the Impact of Prominence Reduction Policies"}]}
