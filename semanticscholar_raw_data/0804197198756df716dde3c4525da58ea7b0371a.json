A multiple-case study with two types of actors \u2013 six HOs and three donors\u2014is used to describe the applications of the PM process and analyze the level of integration between the actors.\n\n\nFindings\nThe activities in the PM process could sometimes be only vaguely described. Both actors emphasized improving CE, with less emphasis on LTE. Both actors have a low level of integration in each PM process activity, decreasing the CE and LTE. Therefore, guidelines for improving the level of PM process integration are provided.\n\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nTo the best of the authors\u2019 knowledge, this study is one of the first to combine literature on HSCs and PM process integration, thereby contributing to both literature fields. The concrete contribution of this study is a framework for PM process application and integration among and between HOs and donors.\n\n\nPractical implications\nThe PM process framework can be used to assess PM process application, as well as current and increased level of integration, to improve CE and LTE. The current applications can also inspire other HOs and donors.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nPrevious studies indicate the lack of frameworks in the PM domain of HSCs, especially in the stage of natural disaster preparedness.\n", "venue": "Journal of Humanitarian Logistics and Supply Chain Management", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-04-11", "journal": {"name": "Journal of Humanitarian Logistics and Supply Chain Management"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2006191293", "name": "Ester Lisnati Jayadi"}, {"authorId": "11755991", "name": "H.
