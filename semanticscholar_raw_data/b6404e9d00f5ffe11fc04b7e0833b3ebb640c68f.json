Existing methods predominantly rely on adaptive buffering, but often fall short in performance, thereby constraining practical applications. We introduce PECJ, a solution that proactively incorporates unobserved data to enhance accuracy while reducing latency, thus requiring robust predictive modeling of stream oscillation. At the heart of PECJ lies a mathematical formulation of the posterior distribution approximation (PDA) problem using variational inference (VI). This approach circumvents error propagation while meeting the low-latency demands of SWJ. We detail the implementation of PECJ, striking a balance between complexity and generality, and discuss both analytical and learning-based approaches. Experimental evaluations reveal PECJ's superior performance. The successful integration of PECJ into a multi-threaded SWJ benchmark testbed further establishes its practical value, demonstrating promising advancements in enhancing data stream processing capabilities amidst out-of-order data.", "venue": "Proceedings of the ACM on Management of Data", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-03-12", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the ACM on Management of Data"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2111551824", "name": "Xianzhi Zeng"}, {"authorId": "2294042212", "name": "Shuhao Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2294155430", "name": "Hongbin Zhong"}, {"authorId": "2294199912", "name": "Hao Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2159707363", "name": "Mian Lu"}, {"authorId": "2115549840", "name": "Zhao Zheng"}, {"authorId": "2219968792", "name": "Yuqiang Chen"}], "citations": []}
