This approach extends related works by considering the uncertainties generated by variations in network conditions and the parameter imprecision affecting the behavior of network flow, which increases the complexity to reach high accuracy in identifying the network traffic. Some evaluations using the interval-valued logic approach for video streaming traffic classification are presented using application tools and datasets to validate the proposal.", "venue": "IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-07-18", "journal": {"name": "2022 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE)", "pages": "1-8"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2129489983", "name": "Eduardo M.
