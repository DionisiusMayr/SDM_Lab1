The task becomes even more complex when the pipelines process nested data. Provenance solutions that track the derivation process of individual data items assist data engineers while debugging these pipelines. However, state-of-the-art solutions do not precisely track nested data items. We demonstrate Pebble, a system for capturing and querying a new type of provenance on nested data in Spark called structural provenance. It captures access and modification of top-level as well as nested data items, and allows querying the provenance of nested items based on tree-pattern-matching. Implemented as a standalone library on top of Apache Spark, it seamlessly leverages the underlying infrastructure for scalability. Through the graphical user interface implemented in a Jupyter notebook we showcase ten debugging scenarios of Spark programs on real-world datasets.", "venue": "SIGMOD Conference", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2019-06-25", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 2019 International Conference on Management of Data"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "23695815", "name": "Ralf Diestelk\u00e4mper"}, {"authorId": "143677452", "name": "Melanie Herschel"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "6a77a10a3f5b3b70dcd5238303967de2903af1b5", "title": "Collecting and visualizing data lineage of Spark jobs"}, {"paperId": "db2513ef61b1f96a7b4f922f3e9dd1cc543ea6a7", "title": "Distributed Tree-Pattern Matching in Big Data Analytics Systems"}, {"paperId": "90f4d52b94ff7b62e800c283bd292d59dfdd3ab3", "title": "Advances in Databases and Information Systems: 24th European Conference, ADBIS 2020, Lyon, France, August 25\u201327, 2020, Proceedings"}, {"paperId": "059c3805891ac1d1442cca6cc37a59ee9864e0da", "title": "Tracing nested data with structural provenance for big data analytics"}]}
