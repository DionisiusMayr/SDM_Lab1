Since, cloud supports various applications, it requires immediate attention for serious security and privacy issues. Research must focus on efficient security mechanism for cloud-based networks, also it is essential to explore the techniques to maintain the integrity and confidentiality of the data. This paper highlights research challenges and directions concerning the security as a comprehensive study through intensive analysis of various literatures in the last decade, and it is summarized in terms of architecture types, evaluation strategies and security model. We surveyed, investigated and reviewed the articles in every aspect related to security and privacy preserving concepts and identified the following tasks: 1) architecture of wireless body area networks in cloud, 2) security and privacy in cloud based WBAN, 3), Cloud security and privacy issues in cloud 4) diverse authentication and cryptographic approaches, 4) optimization strategies to improve the security performance.", "venue": "Innovations in Information and Communication Technology Series", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2020-12-30", "journal": {"name": "Innovations in Information and Communication Technology Series"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2137894366", "name": "Gomathy B"}, {"authorId": "2137482970", "name": "Ramesh Sm"}, {"authorId": "2137145293", "name": "Shanmugavadivel G"}], "citations": []}
