Considering the general assumption that TinyML can only run inference, growing interest in the domain has led to work that makes them reformable, i.e., solutions that permit models to improve once deployed. This work presents a survey on reformable TinyML solutions with the proposal of a novel taxonomy. Here, the suitability of each hierarchical layer for reformability is discussed. Furthermore, we explore the workflow of TinyML and analyze the identified deployment schemes, available tools, and the scarcely available benchmarking tools. Finally, we discuss how reformable TinyML can impact a few selected industrial areas and discuss the challenges, and future directions, and its fusion with next-generation AI.", "venue": "ACM Computing Surveys", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Engineering"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-04-02", "journal": {"name": "ACM Computing Surveys", "pages": "1 - 30", "volume": "55"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2044354712", "name": "Visal Rajapakse"}, {"authorId": "65739028", "name": "Ishan Karunanayake"}, {"authorId": "2069486128", "name": "Nadeem Ahmed"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "c0f4a265d4adc56defdc78cb1101a9de126c8b37", "title": "Investigating the Suitability of Time Series Classification Algorithms for Embedded Systems: A Case Study on Bicycle Pedaling Detection"}, {"paperId": "35763a8caa5a465fc477ba6a759d10b6128939e5", "title": "End-to-end deep learning pipeline for on-board extraterrestrial rock segmentation"}, {"paperId": "f1afde82a733022bf27fc0070a6acdbd0cc02112", "title": "On the adversarial robustness of full integer quantized TinyML models at the edge"}, {"paperId": "dbc69345104c012b01327e7607d54c0097976e35", "title": "Swift-CNN: Leveraging PCM Memory\u2019s Fast Write Mode to Accelerate CNNs"}, {"paperId": "dcf62a211deefebca9b0fc72140f309ef169bd59", "title": "Integrating a Neural Network Library in Embedded Federated Learning"}, {"paperId": "9c713bf42d9cd4aa57b1a09b2e60e7405d8ed43d", "title": "To Personalize or Not To Personalize?
