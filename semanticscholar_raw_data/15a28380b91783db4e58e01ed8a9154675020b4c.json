Choosing and integrating single services into a combined service to fulfill the client's requests requires higher emphasis. However, by increasing customers' trend to utilize CMfg, service providers are encouraged to publish services with various functional and non\u2010functional characteristics. Thus, service composition and optimal selection has become one of the most challenging topics in CMfg. Hence, an inclusive review of current studies on this NP\u2010hard issue is extremely desirable. This article first, selects the recent studies in the field of single\u2010objective service composition in CMfg and classifies and surveys them comprehensively in terms of QoS parameters, energy consumption, user constraint, and so forth. This article aims to provide a useful roadmap for future researchers who are intended to explore novel work in this field.
