In this paper, we propose a method that uses a combination of word embeddings together with \u201cclassical\u201d, domain-engineered features, to obtain reliable classification models for malicious URLs detection. Additionally, we explore different traditional techniques to address class imbalance \u2013 such as synthetic oversampling or cost-sensitive learning \u2013 and several classification techniques. We find that the best overall results are obtained by using a cost-sensitive neural network \u2013 with a precision that exceeds 99% and an accuracy above 90%, while maintaining a recall rate above 89%. We have performed an analysis of the importance of the features proposed, and found that while word embeddings produce better results than bi-gram based features, domain-specific features are necessary for obtaining a high precision in detecting malicious URLs.", "venue": "International Conference on Computational Photography", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2020-09-03", "journal": {"name": "2020 IEEE 16th International Conference on Intelligent Computer Communication and Processing (ICCP)", "pages": "187-193"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "82952858", "name": "Andrei Crisan"}, {"authorId": "119227955", "name": "G.
