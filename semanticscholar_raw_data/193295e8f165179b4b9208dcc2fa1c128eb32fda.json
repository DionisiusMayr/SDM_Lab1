We aimed to identify meal-specific dietary patterns and their contribution to habitual dietary patterns. This cross-sectional study was conducted on 838 adults, both sexes who attended the health centres in Tehran. Dietary data were recorded by three 24-h dietary recalls (24hDR). Dietary patterns were identified by using principal component analysis on meal-specific and overall food intakes. Intraclass correlation (ICC) was used as a measurement of consistency across meals and days. Correlation analysis and linear regression (partial R 2) were used for meals contribution. Four habitual dietary patterns were derived from average dietary intake of 3-d 24hDR labelled as \u2018Western\u2019, \u2018Healthy\u2019, \u2018Traditional\u2019 and \u2018Legume and broth\u2019. Also, we identified two major dietary patterns on each meal level (factor 1 and 2 for breakfast, lunch, afternoon snack and dinner). The highest contribution of energy intake was observed in lunch (25\u00b77 %), followed by dinner (20\u00b781 %). Consistency of food groups was the highest across days (ICC tea = 0\u00b758) and breakfasts (ICC tea = 0\u00b760). Dinner had a strong correlation coefficient with the \u2018Western\u2019 habitual dietary pattern then followed by lunch. Similarly, dinner and lunch contributed the most (r and partial R 2) to the \u2018Western\u2019 habitual dietary pattern. Our results suggest that habitual dietary patterns to several extents are formed at meal levels, and dinner has a greater contribution to the habitual dietary patterns in Iranian people. This may help planning for local dietary guidelines according to the time of eating to promote public health.", "venue": "British Journal of Nutrition", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-05-11", "journal": {"name": "British Journal of Nutrition", "pages": "262 - 271", "volume": "129"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "11171473", "name": "Azadeh Lesani"}, {"authorId": "4507367", "name": "K.
