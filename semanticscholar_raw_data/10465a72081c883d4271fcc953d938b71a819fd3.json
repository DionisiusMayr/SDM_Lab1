Moreover, the volume and variety of data on the data warehouse are very important which involves more effort and investment to minimize the cost of refreshment and data update. Our aim in this paper is to describe the state of the art of research works dealing with the optimization approaches in big data environments especially, the techniques based on indexes selection problems. We will explain the principle of each technique and its particularities approved by our experimental data. In addition, we\u2019ll conclude by the comparison of all these approaches developed in the literature.", "venue": "International Conference on Wireless Networks and Mobile Communications", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-10-26", "journal": {"name": "2023 10th International Conference on Wireless Networks and Mobile Communications (WINCOM)", "pages": "1-7"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2185885478", "name": "Mohamed Ridani"}, {"authorId": "2236001", "name": "M.
