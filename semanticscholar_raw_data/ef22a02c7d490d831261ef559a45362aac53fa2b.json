Their impact on society might as well be more profound, with a radical restructuring of the economy of knowledge and dramatic consequences for social and institutional balances. Different attitudes to control these systems have emerged rooted in the classical pillars of legal systems, proprietary rights, and social responsibility. We show how an illusion of control might be guiding governments and regulators, while autonomous systems might be driving us to inescapable delusion.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-03-02", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2403.01292"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2289844360", "name": "St'ephane Grumbach"}, {"authorId": "2289843842", "name": "Giorgio Resta"}, {"authorId": "2289843882", "name": "Riccardo Torlone"}], "citations": []}
