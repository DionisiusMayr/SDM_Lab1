In addition to well-known open problems in this area, there are many new research challenges that have surfaced as a result of the first interaction of AQP technology with commercial and real-world customers. We categorize these into deployment, planning, and interface challenges. At the same time, AQP settings introduce many interesting opportunities that would not be possible in a database with precise answers. These opportunities create hopes for overcoming some of the major limitations of traditional database systems. For example, we discuss how a database can reuse its past work in a generic way, and become smarter as it answers new queries. Our goal in this talk is to suggest some of the exciting research directions in this field that are worth pursuing.", "venue": "SIGMOD Conference", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"],
