This research develops a probability flood map for floods resulting from climate change in the future. Two models of Flexible Discrimination Analysis (FDA) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) were used. Two optimistic (RCP2.6) and pessimistic (RCP8.5) climate change scenarios were considered for mapping future rainfall. Moreover, to produce probability flood occurrence maps, 263 locations of past flood events were used as dependent variables. The number of 13 factors conditioning floods was taken as independent variables in modeling. Of the total 263 flood locations, 80% (210 locations) and 20% (53 locations) were considered model training and validation. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and other statistical criteria were used to validate the models. Based on assessments of the validated models, FDA, with a ROC-AUC = 0.918, standard error (SE = 0.038), and an accuracy of 0.86% compared to the ANN model with a ROC-AUC = 0.897, has the highest accuracy in preparing the flood probability map in the study area. The modeling results also showed that the factors of distance from the River, altitude, slope, and rainfall have the greatest impact on floods in the study area. Both models\u2019 future flood susceptibility maps showed that the highest area is related to the very low class. The lowest area is related to the high class.", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Environmental Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2021-01-05", "journal": {"name": "", "pages": "25", "volume": "11"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1397319656", "name": "Mohammadtaghi Avand"}, {"authorId": "28966955", "name": "H.
