It has been recently reported, however, that these systems fail to translate hardware improvements, such as increased network bandwidth, into a higher throughput. This is particularly the case for applications that have inherent sequential, computationally intensive phases. In this paper, we analyze the data processing cores of state-of-the-art big data systems to find the cause for these scalability problems. We identify design patterns in the code that are suitable for pipeline and task-level parallelism, potentially increasing application performance. As a proof of concept, we rewrite parts of the Hadoop MapReduce framework in an implicit parallel language that exploits this parallelism without adding code complexity. Our experiments on a data analytics workload show throughput speedups of up to 3.5x.", "venue": "PMAM@PPoPP", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2018-02-24", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 9th International Workshop on Programming Models and Applications for Multicores and Manycores"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3704023", "name": "Sebastian Ertel"}, {"authorId": "40047362", "name": "Justus Adam"}, {"authorId": "144195575", "name": "J.
