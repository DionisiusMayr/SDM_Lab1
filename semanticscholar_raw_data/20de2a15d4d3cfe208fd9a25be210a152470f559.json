The system can estimate the angle of arrival (AoA) of a Bluetooth low energy tag by an appropriately designed anchor point. Both the anchor point and the tag are described in detail from the hardware perspective, the direction finding algorithm is briefly explained, the novelties of the system are identified and the measurement results validate the proof of concept for the AoA application targeted with the proposed system.", "venue": "European Conference on Antennas and Propagation", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-03-26", "journal": {"name": "2023 17th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP)", "pages": "1-5"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2218637666", "name": "Ioannis Gouzouasis"}, {"authorId": "2703598", "name": "S.
