Exploring and analyzing diabetes data is a timely concern because it may prompt a variety of serious illnesses, including stroke, kidneyfailure,heartattacks,etc.Severalexistingpiecesofresearchhaverevealedthatdiabetesdata,suchassystolicbloodpressure(SBP),diastolicbloodpressure(DBP),weight,height,age,etc.,canprovideinsightfulinformationaboutpatientsdiabetesstates.

Objective: This study aims to design an interactive Visualization system (Vis) to explore diabetes mellitus (DM) insights and its associated factors in Bangladesh. Methods: In this study, first, a case study method has employed to understand diabetes data. Second, we examine the potential of user-centered technology in addressing these challenges and design a Vis named \u201c DiaVis \u201d to process and present raw data in the form of graphics, graphs, and processed text, as well as a variety of user interaction possibilities. It helps to extract valuable data and present it in a simple and easy-to-understand way. Moreover, we highlight some key insights from our study that may help explore the healthcare community. Results: A user study with 20 individuals is used to evaluate our system. By allowing iterative exploration and modification of data in a dashboard with multiple-coordinated views, the DiaVis system improves the flow of visual analysis. Conclusion: This study suggests that the healthcare community should pay more attention to developing appropriate policy measures to reduce the risk of DM. \u00a9 2021 The Authors .
