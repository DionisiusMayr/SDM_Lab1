The existing big data workflows unify the data processing practices to utilize the cloud\u2019s native computational potentials to offer advanced machine learning and BI capabilities. Spark is an open-source massively parallel in-memory data processing framework, the current state-of-the-art. The primary approach is to break down the job into granular-level executed tasks, enabling parallelization. In the discussed case study, through IoT \u2013 cloud solutions, the plant data can be converted into an analyzable form to let the farther machine learning modules produce added value. To maximize the efficiency of the processing and accumulation, cloud-based components are introduced. Based on the data insights, the appropriate operative actions can be taken. The cost and performance optimization methods were also discussed in the study. Through achieving higher degree of digitalization, the control over the production increased.", "venue": "Acta Electrotechnica et Informatica", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-06-01", "journal": {"name": "Acta Electrotechnica et Informatica", "pages": "19 - 26", "volume": "22"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "35429224", "name": "Istv\u00e1n P\u00f6l\u00f6skei"}], "citations": []}
