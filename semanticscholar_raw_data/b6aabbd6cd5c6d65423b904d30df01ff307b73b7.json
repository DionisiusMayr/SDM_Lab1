Exploiting the large degrees of parallelism of GPU to improve the performance of online analytical processing (OLAP) in database system is a common practice in the industry. Meanwhile, it is a common practice to exploit the large degrees of parallelism of GPU to improve the performance of online analytical processing (OLAP) in database systems. This demo presents GHive, which enables Apache Hive to accelerate OLAP queries by jointly utilizing CPU and GPU in intelligent and efficient ways. The takeaways for SIGMOD attendees include: (1) the superior performance of GHive compared with vanilla Hive that only uses CPU; (2) intuitive visualizations of execution statistics for Hive and GHive to understand where the acceleration of GHive comes from; (3) detailed profiling of the time taken by each operator on CPU and GPU to show the advantages of GPU execution.", "venue": "SIGMOD Conference", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-06-10", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 2022 International Conference on Management of Data"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2143856694", "name": "Haotian Liu"}, {"authorId": "2084612700", "name": "Bo Tang"}, {"authorId": "2169863164", "name": "Jiashu Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2170046802", "name": "Yangshen Deng"}, {"authorId": "3155405", "name": "Xinying Zheng"}, {"authorId": "2647686", "name": "Qiaomu Shen"}, {"authorId": "145837716", "name": "Xiao Yan"}, {"authorId": "39422721", "name": "Dan Zeng"}, {"authorId": "2169798543", "name": "Zunyao Mao"}, {"authorId": "1931691545", "name": "Chaozu Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2120458025", "name": "Zhengxin You"}, {"authorId": "2169824091", "name": "Zhihao Wang"}, {"authorId": "2169798086", "name": "Runzhe Jiang"}, {"authorId": "7572514", "name": "Fang Wang"}, {"authorId": "1722082", "name": "Man Lung Yiu"}, {"authorId": "2143213767", "name": "Huan Li"}, {"authorId": "2111857152", "name": "Mingji Han"}, {"authorId": "2170038947", "name": "Qian Li"}, {"authorId": "2169789115", "name": "Zhenghai Luo"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "cde959deaf38e5bfaeb1f66cc0b77d21d6dcd09d", "title": "QEVIS: Multi-Grained Visualization of Distributed Query Execution"}, {"paperId": "b9c07803a64b63a79470005573d37128df409ae7", "title": "DHive: Query Execution Performance Analysis via Dataflow in Apache Hive"}, {"paperId": "47da72a952b4d9e724242e45f6d3a9402479ce27", "title": "Towards Building The Next Generation Computation Engine"}]}
