Current systems to process large-scale videos are suboptimal due to the following reasons: (1) machine learning modules such as feature extractors and classifiers generate huge intermediate data and place heavy burden to the storage and network, and (2) task scheduling is explicit; manually configuring the machine learning modules on the cluster is tedious and inefficient. In this work, we propose Elastic Streaming Sequential data Processing system (ESSP) that supports automatic task scheduling; multiple machine learning components are automatically parallelized. Further, our system prevents extensive disc I/O by applying the in-memory dataflow scheme. Evaluation on real-world video classification datasets shows many-fold improvements.", "venue": "LSVC '17", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2017-10-27", "journal": {"name": "", "pages": "1-7", "volume": ""}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2110930164", "name": "Yao Peng"}, {"authorId": "151486061", "name": "Hao Ye"}, {"authorId": "11320042", "name": "Yining Lin"}, {"authorId": "3393850", "name": "Yixin Bao"}, {"authorId": "153023018", "name": "Zhijian Zhao"}, {"authorId": "31567595", "name": "Haonan Qiu"}, {"authorId": "2143370796", "name": "Yao Lu"}, {"authorId": "2152717310", "name": "Li Wang"}, {"authorId": "3015119", "name": "Yingbin Zheng"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "ee79afe717b7a6ae31483ec20b3730e46206a43d", "title": "Event and Activity Recognition in Video Surveillance for Cyber-Physical Systems"}, {"paperId": "28b1de50f2e1f228e94691e19dc9996c43bbf0cb", "title": "LightDB: A DBMS for Virtual Reality Video"}, {"paperId": "38a3a6831a5bba2830ccc29d43a2b97253676183", "title": "VisualWorldDB: A DBMS for the Visual World"}]}
