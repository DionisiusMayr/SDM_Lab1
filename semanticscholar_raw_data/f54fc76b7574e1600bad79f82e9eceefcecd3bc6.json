ML Operations (MLOps) represents an effective strategy for bringing ML models from academic resources to useful tools for solving problems in the corporate world. The current literature on MLOps is still mostly disconnected and sporadic. In this work, we review the existing scientific literature and we propose a taxonomy for clustering research papers on MLOps. In addition, we present methodologies and operations aimed at defining a ML pipeline to simplify the release of ML applications in industry. The pipeline is based on ten steps: business problem understanding, data acquisition, ML methodology, ML training & testing, continuous integration, continuous delivery, continuous training, continuous monitoring, explainability, and sustainability. The scientific and business interest and the impact of MLOps have grown significantly over the past years. The definition of a clear and standardized methodology for conducting MLOps projects is the main contribution of this paper.", "venue": "IEEE Access", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "IEEE Access", "pages": "1-1", "volume": "PP"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2169705357", "name": "Matteo Testi"}, {"authorId": "2169697262", "name": "Matteo Ballabio"}, {"authorId": "1721130", "name": "E.
