Machine Learning (ML) algorithms as a popular approach for NTC can promise reasonable accuracy in classification and deal with encrypted traffic. However, ML-based NTC techniques suffer from the shortage of labeled traffic data which is the case in many real-world applications. This study investigates the applicability of an active form of ML, called Active Learning (AL), in NTC. AL reduces the need for a large number of labeled examples by actively choosing the instances that should be labeled. The study first provides an overview of NTC and its fundamental challenges along with surveying the literature on ML-based NTC methods. Then, it introduces the concepts of AL, discusses it in the context of NTC, and review the literature in this field. Further, challenges and open issues in AL-based classification of network traffic are discussed. Moreover, as a technical survey, some experiments are conducted to show the broad applicability of AL in NTC. The simulation results show that AL can achieve high accuracy with a small amount of data.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2021-06-13", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking", "pages": "422-439", "volume": "8"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "143730558", "name": "A.
