The edge server aims to provide additional computing resources to the end-users for processing the delay-sensitive tasks. However, at the same time, it becomes a challenging issue when some of the tasks demand lower response time compared to the other tasks. We present a priority-aware task offloading and scheduling strategy that allocates the computing resources to the high-priority tasks. The hard-deadline tasks are processed first. Later, the remaining computing resources are used to tolerate longer average response time for the soft-deadline tasks. Moreover, we derive a lower bound of the average response time for all hard- and soft-deadline tasks. Through extensive simulations, we show that the proposed task scheduling manages to allocate the computing resources of both end-users and edge server to the hard-deadline tasks while scheduling the soft-deadline tasks with low priority.", "venue": "Global Communications Conference", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2020-12-01", "journal": {"name": "GLOBECOM 2020 - 2020 IEEE Global Communications Conference", "pages": "1-5"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3114683", "name": "M.
