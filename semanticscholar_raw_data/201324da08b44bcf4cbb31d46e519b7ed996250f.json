A lot of new frameworks have been proposed to deal with the problem of processing, analysis and storage of big data. As one of them, Apache Flink is an open source platform allowing for distributed stream and batch data processing. Cypher, a declarative query language developed by Neo4j, shows its significant strengths when it encounters graph database compared to traditional relational query languages. However, by now the newest released version of Cypher still has limitations on its data parallelism and scalability. In this thesis, we first formulate an algebra for expressing Cypher queries. Then we describe the implementation of basic operators of Cypher algebra on Flink that allows the representation of a subset of Cypher queries. To our knowledge, there is no previous work in this field. Based on our observations, a cost-based query optimizer and a rule-based query optimizer are proposed to build efficient query plans. We compare the performance of these two query optimizers and finally analyze the advantages and disadvantages of these two optimization strategies.
