In recent years, there has been a significant rise in the number of studies that look at how intelligent transportation systems (ITS) can be used and what role it plays in making roads safer in different countries. Nevertheless, there are still relatively few in-depth quantitative and qualitative analyses published on the topic of ITS's role in ensuring road safety. For this purpose, the main goal of this study is to look at a thorough quantitative and qualitative analysis of how ITS is used in road safety as a part of transportation engineering. In this study, we reviewed the scientific studies done on the use of ITS in studies of road safety from 1990s to 2022. These studies were published in journals or presented at conferences that were part of the Web of Science (WoS) Index. The analysis in this study gives a thorough map of the field, showing how it has changed over time and pointing the way to new areas of research.", "venue": "", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "3309290", "name": "G.
