In Generative AI, human involvement is essential, thus HCI literature has investigated how to effectively create collaborations between humans and GenAI systems. However, the current literature lacks a comprehensive framework to better understand Human-GenAI Interactions, as the holistic aspects of human-centered GenAI systems are rarely analyzed systematically. In this paper, we present a survey of 291 papers, providing a novel taxonomy and analysis of Human-GenAI Interactions from both human and Gen-AI perspectives. The dimensions of design space include 1) Purposes of Using Generative AI, 2) Feedback from Models to Users, 3) Control from Users to Models, 4) Levels of Engagement, 5) Application Domains, and 6) Evaluation Strategies. Our work is also timely at the current development stage of GenAI, where the Human-GenAI interaction design is of paramount importance. We also highlight challenges and opportunities to guide the design of Gen-AI systems and interactions towards the future design of human-centered Generative AI applications.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-10-11", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2310.07127"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2214757731", "name": "Jingyu Shi"}, {"authorId": "2257044862", "name": "Rahul Jain"}, {"authorId": "2257037244", "name": "Hyungjun Doh"}, {"authorId": "2257038535", "name": "Ryo Suzuki"}, {"authorId": "2150139980", "name": "Karthik Ramani"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "b5710193dc676e0b9043f00759d776d10d3f6ea5", "title": "PlantoGraphy: Incorporating Iterative Design Process into Generative Artificial Intelligence for Landscape Rendering"}]}
