In this paper, we explore the case for direct storage access inside the accelerator applications, and discuss the problem, design options and benefits of this architecture. We demonstrate that our architecture can improve throughputs of LevelDB by 12\u201389%, and reduce the execution time by 33\u201346 % in a bioinformatics application in comparison to the baseline where the host system mediates the storage accesses.", "venue": "USENIX Workshop on Hot Topics in Storage and File Systems", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "", "volume": ""}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2095111745", "name": "Shinichi Awamoto"}, {"authorId": "2878377", "name": "E.
