We describe a novel load balancing scheme to address this problem. Our scheme is implemented in the IrGL compiler to allow users to generate efficient load balanced code for a GPU from high-level sequential programs. We evaluated several graph analytics applications on up to 16 distributed GPUs using IrGL to compile the code and the Gluon substrate for inter-GPU communication. Our experiments show that this scheme can achieve an average speed-up of 2.2x on inputs that suffer from severe load imbalance problems when previous state-of-the-art load-balancing schemes are used.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2019-11-20", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/1911.09135"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3263059", "name": "Vishwesh Jatala"}, {"authorId": "47348084", "name": "Loc Hoang"}, {"authorId": "1925460", "name": "Roshan Dathathri"}, {"authorId": "49983901", "name": "G.
