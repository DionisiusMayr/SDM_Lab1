Existing research has focused mainly on measuring two paired sentences. However, to find possible identical texts between two datasets, the sentences are not paired. To avoid pair-wise comparison, this thesis proposed a semantic similarity measuring system equipped with a precategorization module. It applies a hybrid question classification module, which subdivides all texts to coarse categories. The sentences are then paired from these subcategories. The core task is to detect identical texts between two sentences, which relates to the semantic textual similarity task in the NLP field. We built a short text semantic textual similarity measuring module. It combined conventional NLP techniques, including both semantic and syntactic features, with a Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network to accomplish an ensemble model. We also conducted a set of empirical evaluations. The results show that our system possesses a degree of generalization ability, and it performs well on heterogeneous sources.", "venue": "", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2114968512", "name": "Yu Qiu"}, {"authorId": "145069202", "name": "S.
