This paper presents a collection of efficient parallel algorithms for hypergraph processing, including algorithms for betweenness centrality, maximal independent set, k-core decomposition, hypertrees, hyperpaths, connected components, PageRank, and single-source shortest paths. For these problems, we either provide new parallel algorithms or more efficient implementations than prior work. Furthermore, our algorithms are theoretically-efficient in terms of work and depth. To implement our algorithms, we extend the Ligra graph processing framework to support hypergraphs, and our implementations benefit from graph optimizations including switching between sparse and dense traversals based on the frontier size, edge-aware parallelization, using buckets to prioritize processing of vertices, and compression. Our experiments on a 72-core machine and show that our algorithms obtain excellent parallel speedups, and are significantly faster than algorithms in existing hypergraph processing frameworks.", "venue": "ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles & Practice of Parallel Programming", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2020-02-19", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 25th ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles and Practice of Parallel Programming"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2045944", "name": "Julian Shun"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "fbc65422b768b91a19f73a2bfa987b1db8c3dc72", "title": "Influence maximization in hypergraphs: A self-optimizing algorithm based on electrostatic field"}, {"paperId": "fe98c13e437d031949cdc7bb9516c04d43ccecb4", "title": "Core maintenance for hypergraph streams"}, {"paperId": "65b1e73fe34cdfa714b8a504e0e8edfa9bf02d92", "title": "A Survey on Hypergraph Representation Learning"}, {"paperId": "b739ec5306307f3575547f83c5ab2cf7c65c4a17", "title": "Hyper-distance Oracles in Hypergraphs"}, {"paperId": "2cc04a6982bf2cb75e0cf95537f067cdc0c991a1", "title": "Distances in Higher-Order Networks and the Metric Structure of Hypergraphs"}, {"paperId": "7e7ee64fafdb6cce884ab1def2d55359a370e473", "title": "High-Performance and Flexible Parallel Algorithms for Semisort and Related Problems"}, {"paperId": "e4a5110c8338eeec32f08e9dd1cf12d7c985990a", "title": "Finer-Grained Engagement in Hypergraphs"}, {"paperId": "c3e03d1151cf2aa88ad80b915bcd296cf8bc8ce6", "title": "Revisiting Core Maintenance for Dynamic Hypergraphs"}, {"paperId": "b419da0b37426bb237399691a362df31d0f1eed5", "title": "Neighborhood-based Hypergraph Core Decomposition"}, {"paperId": "3f5701f0b8ae2a039635d2486123f52bb6a1711c", "title": "Glign: Taming Misaligned Graph Traversals in Concurrent Graph Processing"}, {"paperId": "9d0b6b233fe4cb1453263e89c3878681615b2a5f", "title": "A Data-Centric Accelerator for High-Performance Hypergraph Processing"}, {"paperId": "25cf0ff2b3ed84c4969cdd83dd449bd3f7aa83d2", "title": "Toward maintenance of hypercores in large-scale dynamic hypergraphs"}, {"paperId": "bb9ba9422cec8891dc57fec690609309c341fde8", "title": "Distributed Hypergraph Processing Using Intersection Graphs"}, {"paperId": "1610f126a51d49d8a0c49779b2575684970023ff", "title": "Optimal and Robust Category-Level Perception: Object Pose and Shape Estimation From 2-D and 3-D Semantic Keypoints"}, {"paperId": "c4c1697147225ccea598e17402aae9da75627e4c", "title": "A Parallel Algorithm Template for Updating Single-Source Shortest Paths in Large-Scale Dynamic Networks"}, {"paperId": "48d8c591814b71462fe930089a7f6e2574948cff", "title": "Mashup: making serverless computing useful for HPC workflows via hybrid execution"}, {"paperId": "11968104f2a6924c5f77361a2b31dc1392a338ee", "title": "High-order Line Graphs of Non-uniform Hypergraphs: Algorithms, Applications, and Experimental Analysis"}, {"paperId": "07ac451fec00be24a4cc3f4f623b9f9fa7519d9f", "title": "The Cost of Compositionality: A High-Performance Implementation of String Diagram Composition"}, {"paperId": "19920acbb4d3c9d867dffee219d2c66a7b6258b3", "title": "Shared-Memory Scalable k-Core Maintenance on Dynamic Graphs and Hypergraphs"}, {"paperId": "d732c3a2f1dbe4c608166f252784e3790bad4502", "title": "Hypercore Maintenance in Dynamic Hypergraphs"}, {"paperId": "1756e9ad7115cb6dfc7aca417a2230a5950d191b", "title": "Mathematics of Digital Hyperspace"}, {"paperId": "ab722a9ee7c45e2bfda50f9d87eb32d538501153", "title": "Cache-Efficient Fork-Processing Patterns on Large Graphs"}, {"paperId": "6752b295719730aca4db295bc61a744d94e4519a", "title": "Efficient Computation of High-Order Line Graphs of Hypergraphs"}, {"paperId": "4b134c6a250efe9410dd561f0e48a8f2d526dcdf", "title": "Parallel Algorithms and Heuristics for Efficient Computation of High-Order Line Graphs of Hypergraphs"}, {"paperId": "71a42ecba04a76c376e767adbe8443afcf47bd62", "title": "Distributed Algorithms for Matching in Hypergraphs"}, {"paperId": "7353ae775839606761ca2a8630d5c7891f1285ed", "title": "The Graph Based Benchmark Suite (GBBS)"}, {"paperId": "92a050b515543cdfb614857a2a68ada9c97f6f05", "title": "An Efficient and Scalable Distributed Hypergraph Processing System"}]}
