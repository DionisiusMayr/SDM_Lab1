For this purpose, a data set was created by using the equivalent earthquake load method according to the Building Earthquake Code of Turkey (2018). Data mining methods such as feature selection, detection and removing of outlier values, dimensionality reduction were used on the created data set, and how the results changed with which methods were discussed. The results revealed that short-period spectral acceleration coefficient taken from AFAD map (SS) and total building height (HN) are not required for successful prediction of earthquake force acting on reinforced concrete buildings without shear wall with machine learning methods.", "venue": "Eski\u015fehir Osmangazi \u00dcniversitesi M\u00fchendislik ve Mimarl\u0131k Fak\u00fcltesi Dergisi", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-05-17", "journal": {"name": "Eski\u015fehir Osmangazi \u00dcniversitesi M\u00fchendislik ve Mimarl\u0131k Fak\u00fcltesi Dergisi"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2179255073", "name": "Tarkan Kara\u00e7ay"}, {"authorId": "2179252232", "name": "Tolga A\u00e7ikg\u00f6z"}], "citations": []}
