It introduces a few small extensions to the SQL query language that allow clients to express progressive analytical queries. These extensions are processed in the ProgressiveDB middleware that sits between a database application and the underlying database providing interactive query processing as well as query steering capabilities to the user. In our demo, we show how this system allows a database application with a graphical user interface to interact with different backends, while providing the user with immediate feedback during exploratory data exploration of an on-time flight database. ProgressiveDB also supports efficient query steering by providing a new technique, called progressive views, which allows the intermediate results of one progressive query to be shared and reused by multiple concurrent progressive queries with refined scope.
