In those complex frameworks, optimizing code by hand is hard and time-consuming, making automated optimization particularly necessary. In order to automate optimization, a prerequisite is to find suitable abstractions to represent programs; for instance, algebras based on monads or monoids to represent distributed data collections. Currently, however, such algebras do not represent recursive programs in a way which allows for analyzing or rewriting them. In this paper, we extend a monoid algebra with a fixpoint operator for representing recursion as a first class citizen and show how it enables new optimizations. Experiments with the Spark platform illustrate performance gains brought by these systematic optimizations.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-06-13", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2306.07690"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "150293437", "name": "Sarah Chlyah"}, {"authorId": "3166816", "name": "N.
