Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was used to validate the model.FindingsThe results reveal that all hypotheses were accepted. Business value was the construct that had the most explanatory power in the model. It is necessary to invest more in analytical tools, as well as people trained in the analysis of these models, in addition to a change of mindset, which will dictate the bias of the firm's strategic decision-making. The Big Data analysis is evident from firms' growing investments, particularly those that operate in complex and fast-paced environments.Practical implicationsThe proposed theoretical model makes it possible to verify firms' analytical structure and whether they are better positioned to analyze customer data and information in real-time, generate insights and implement solutions to maintain and improve their market position.Originality/valueThe contribution of this article is to present a proposal to expand the research models in the literature that analyzed the direct and indirect relationship between \u201cBig Data Analytics Capability\u201d and \u201cProduct Innovation Performance\u201d.", "venue": "Journal of Enterprise Information Management", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2021-08-03", "journal": {"name": "J.
