The main problem is that the big data system is based on Hadoop technology, especially MapReduce for processing. This latter is a high scalability and fault tolerant framework. It also processes a large amount of data in batches and provides perception blast insight of older data, but it can only process a limited set of data. MapReduce is not appropriate for real time stream processing, and is very important to process data the moment they arrive at a fast response and a good decision making. Ergo the need for a new architecture that allows real-time data processing with high speed along with low latency. The major aim of the paper at hand is to give a clear survey of the different open sources technologies that exist for real-time data stream processing including their system architectures. We shall also provide a brand new architecture which is mainly based on previous comparisons of real-time processing powered with machine learning and storm technology.", "venue": "", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications", "volume": "8"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "51151784", "name": "S.
