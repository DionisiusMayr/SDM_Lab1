We implement the algorithm and develop a distributed framework called BigDataflow running on a large-scale cluster.The experimental results validate the promising performance of BigDataflow \u2013 it can finish analyzing the program of millions lines of code in minutes. Compared with the state-of-the-art, BigDataflow achieves much more analysis efficiency.", "venue": "ESEC/SIGSOFT FSE", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book"], "publicationDate": "2023-11-30", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 31st ACM Joint European Software Engineering Conference and Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2268821024", "name": "Zewen Sun"}, {"authorId": "2268809423", "name": "Duanchen Xu"}, {"authorId": "2268821977", "name": "Yiyu Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2268822857", "name": "Yun Qi"}, {"authorId": "2268802312", "name": "Yueyang Wang"}, {"authorId": "145057220", "name": "Zhiqiang Zuo"}, {"authorId": "2268854213", "name": "Zhaokang Wang"}, {"authorId": "2268800448", "name": "Yue Li"}, {"authorId": "2268821532", "name": "Xuandong Li"}, {"authorId": "2268809474", "name": "Qingda Lu"}, {"authorId": "2268809920", "name": "Wenwen Peng"}, {"authorId": "2268821895", "name": "Shengjian Guo"}], "citations": []}
