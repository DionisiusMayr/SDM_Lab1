The current IOT management platform has a low data processing e\ufb03ciency and a high mistake rate when it comes to \ufb01nding anomalous data. Furthermore, the e\ufb00ective selection and optimum decision of the convolutional neural network\u2019s structural parameters has a signi\ufb01cant impact on prediction performance. Based on this, the paper proposes a decision algorithm for locating anomalous data in an IOT integrated management platform using a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a global optimization decision of key structural parameters of a convolutional neural network using an improved particle swarm optimization (APSO) algorithm. First, an index model is created to determine if the data retrieved from the IOT management platform is anomalous or not. Second, the structure of the convolutional neural network-based decision method for \ufb01nding anomalous data is examined. Following that, an enhanced particle swarm optimization technique is developed to optimize the structural parameters of the convolutional neural network, and an APSO-CNN with improved performance for anomalous data localization is generated. Finally, the established algorithm\u2019s correctness, feasibility, and e\ufb03cacy were evaluated using the Adam optimizer. The results reveal that the established APSO-CNN-based decision algorithm for anomaly data localization o\ufb00ers considerable bene\ufb01ts in terms of accuracy and running time, with extremely interesting application potential.", "venue": "", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2143859870", "name": "Yuan-Kai Liu"}, {"authorId": "2146263757", "name": "Qiang Li"}, {"authorId": "2093549046", "name": "Dingwen Cai"}, {"authorId": "151481228", "name": "Weizhi Lu"}, {"authorId": "2286125901", "name": "Liu Yuan"}, {"authorId": "2286153355", "name": "\u4e28.
