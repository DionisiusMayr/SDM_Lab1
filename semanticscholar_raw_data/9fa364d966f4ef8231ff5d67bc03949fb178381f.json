Modern analytical systems leverage innovative execution methods, such as vectorization and compilation, or enable parallelizing execution at the operator level to reduce single-query runtimes. Unfortunately, further developments to improve single-query execution performance have failed to yield significant improvements and are providing diminishing performance returns. To extend beyond the limits of single-query performance improvements, we propose a codesign method to align database and queueing theory research in workload and architectureaware scheduling policies. In this work, we present the addition of a scheduling component to a highly optimized execution engine and the design of new scheduling algorithms combining awareness of query characteristics and the execution hardware. Our proposed scheduling policies order and assign query sub-tasks to compute resources to enhance performance on analytical workloads in a modern, in-memory execution environment. Further improvements to the execution framework address imbalanced data access patterns and enable locality-aware execution. By optimizing for resource efficiency, our developments decrease the average system latency by over 30%.", "venue": "", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2057858242", "name": "D.
