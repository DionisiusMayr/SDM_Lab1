It can be used for optimizing the performance of interventions such as marketing campaigns and product designs. Uplift modeling can be used to estimate which users are likely to benefit from a treatment and then prioritize delivering or promoting the preferred experience to those users. An important but so far neglected use case for uplift modeling is an experiment with multiple treatment groups that have different costs, such as for example when different communication channels and promotion types are tested simultaneously. In this paper, we extend standard uplift models to support multiple treatment groups with different costs. We evaluate the performance of the proposed models using both synthetic and real data. We also describe a production implementation of the approach.", "venue": "International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2019-08-14", "journal": {"name": "2019 IEEE International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics (DSAA)", "pages": "422-431"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2152619879", "name": "Zhenyu Zhao"}, {"authorId": "30426642", "name": "Totte Harinen"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "dc51ed9f03cb3acdfffe1e71418ea92899306742", "title": "Distribution-consistency Structural Causal Models"}, {"paperId": "cc31aaae0b2c780410af7e31a709ad1e53e19c50", "title": "An Industrial Framework for Personalized Serendipitous Recommendation in E-commerce"}, {"paperId": "6fdc38cad2499b0fc43f6ed0ef0a0952279d5e6c", "title": "Uplift Modeling: From Causal Inference to Personalization"}, {"paperId": "86485720399ddae7bbc5080fd268bd45e99b0acd", "title": "DNet: Distributional Network for Distributional Individualized Treatment Effects"}, {"paperId": "2a24078aef433e13455050e18b8a3c09fc907dab", "title": "A Consumer Compensation System in Ride-hailing Service"}, {"paperId": "54101015ed95794ee3cb4dc0bd8df71ab4891910", "title": "Incremental Profit per Conversion: a Response Transformation for Uplift Modeling in E-Commerce Promotions"}, {"paperId": "47b96d757ed9601b273894902d3ee64a10037be1", "title": "Qini Curves for Multi-Armed Treatment Rules"}, {"paperId": "de1b63023a392d98005ee1797ea9638f1b7900a6", "title": "Automating Pipelines of A/B Tests with Population Split Using Self-Adaptation and Machine Learning"}, {"paperId": "81247405e8dd725a56998270acf990ef49c1070d", "title": "Estimation of causality in economic growth and expansionary policies using uplift modeling"}, {"paperId": "9a4cf2645a3f5b853c8be12f9f15b72cde9d4b13", "title": "An End-to-End Framework for Marketing Effectiveness Optimization under Budget Constraint"}, {"paperId": "b35249403d91934de534a1192eb303f42f4772ad", "title": "Causal Inference Based Single-branch Ensemble Trees For Uplift Modeling"}, {"paperId": "68147f16a750daa8cf8e1d4f00a4cb5e0cd04ba6", "title": "Multiple Tiered Treatments Optimization with Causal Inference on Response Distribution"}, {"paperId": "2f8fea869d2d2e7a1b6f683863eb90b659025e8f", "title": "DESCN: Deep Entire Space Cross Networks for Individual Treatment Effect Estimation"}, {"paperId": "b825e463655ecee7a895fad05f054dd966814caf", "title": "Device-cloud Collaborative Recommendation via Meta Controller"}, {"paperId": "39ceb3b9901ed4fdc53326b69a694d504f1d0308", "title": "GRFlift: uplift modeling for multi-treatment within GMV constraints"}, {"paperId": "9574a9b5248743fd558572e80967b81ba4728c51", "title": "Comparison of meta-learners for estimating multi-valued treatment heterogeneous effects"}, {"paperId": "b611251da0c7cecf2539a24fe862b8514e674dd6", "title": "Personalized Prediction of Future Lesion Activity and Treatment Effect in Multiple Sclerosis from Baseline MRI"}, {"paperId": "34e31c490644ae588145032e3fbe76847b4a2b37", "title": "To do or not to do?
