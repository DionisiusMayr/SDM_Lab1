A number of applications require real-time processing and analysis of massive moving objects' trajectories. For instance, route guidance in emergency evacuation, patients tracking, etc. Existing scalable trajectory management systems lack support for real-time processing, while the real-time systems do not natively support spatial trajectory processing. This work presents TStream, a real-time and scalable trajectory stream processing and analysis framework. TStream utilizes grid index to support efficient processing of continuous range, kNN and join queries.", "venue": "SIGSPATIAL/GIS", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book"], "publicationDate": "2022-11-01", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 30th International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "21062251", "name": "Salman Ahmed Shaikh"}, {"authorId": "1687013", "name": "H.
