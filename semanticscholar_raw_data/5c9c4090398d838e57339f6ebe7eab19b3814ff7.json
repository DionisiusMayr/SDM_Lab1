Being able to process and analyze large quantities of such datasets is therefore critical. Spatial joins in classical geo-information systems do not scale well. Nevertheless, distributed implementations are promising to solve this. Various implementation variants for distributed spatial joins are documented in literature, with some being only suitable for specific use cases. We compared broadcast and multiple variants of a distributed spatially partitioned join. We anticipate that this comparison will give guidance to when to use which implementation strategy.", "venue": "2019 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2019-12-01", "journal": {"name": "2019 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "pages": "6071-6073"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "50101870", "name": "G.
