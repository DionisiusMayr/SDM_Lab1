The sliding-window-based stream join provides a precise result but consumes considerable computational resources. The current solutions lack support for the join predicates on large windows. These algorithms and their hardware accelerators are either limited to equi-join or use a nested loop join to process all the requests. \nIn this paper, we present a new algorithm called PanJoin which has high throughput on large windows and supports both equi-join and non-equi-join. PanJoin implements three new data structures to reduce computations during the probing phase of stream join. We also implement the most hardware-friendly data structure, called BI-Sort, on FPGA. Our evaluation shows that PanJoin outperforms several recently proposed stream join methods by more than 1000x, and it also adapts well to highly skewed data.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2018-11-13", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/1811.05065"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2068794160", "name": "Fei Pan"}, {"authorId": "145641161", "name": "H.
