This can result in serious productivity issues for \u201cnormal\u201d data scientists. This paper introduces AFrame, a new scalable data analysis package powered by a Big Data management system that extends the data scientists\u2019 familiar DataFrame operations to efficiently operate on managed data at scale. AFrame is implemented as a layer on top of Apache AsterixDB, transparently scaling out the execution of DataFrame operations and machine learning model invocation through a parallel, shared-nothing big data management system. AFrame incrementally constructs SQL++ queries and leverages AsterixDB\u2019s semistructured data management facilities, user-defined function support, and live data ingestion support. In order to evaluate the proposed approach, this paper also introduces an extensible micro-benchmark for use in evaluating DataFrame performance in both single-node and distributed settings via a collection of representative analytic operations. This paper presents the architecture of AFrame, describes the underlying capabilities of AsterixDB that efficiently support modern data analytic operations, and utilizes the proposed benchmark to evaluate and compare the performance and support for largescale data analyses provided by alternative DataFrame libraries.", "venue": "2019 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2019-08-19", "journal": {"name": "2019 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "pages": "359-371"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "40913517", "name": "Phanwadee Sinthong"}, {"authorId": "1703347", "name": "M.
