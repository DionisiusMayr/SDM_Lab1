It has become the foremost choice of researchers as of its effectiveness in producing decent results. This paper presents detailed and analytical literature starting from the very elementary level to the recent trends of this trending technology while focusing on the most used DL model, that is, convolutional neural network and its pretrained models for image classification and object detection. It also reviews diverse existing current literature based on this. Further, a brief introduction of AI, ML, and DL has also been presented, making the foundation for the readers. As pretrained models continuously give an upper edge to DL over ML and other technologies, 23 most popular pretrained models with their architectural diagrams have also been presented. This paper aims to summarize and analyze all the concepts used to formulate DL and its models. Also, we have emphasized more on the GoogleNet models and the entire Inception modules in detail. Finally, the fascinating applications and discussion on integral components of DL have been presented. This paper will definitely draw the attention of the students and researchers working in the area of DL and its models.", "venue": "Concurrency and Computation", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2021-12-13", "journal": {"name": "Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience", "volume": "34"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2059690899", "name": "Biswajit Jena"}, {"authorId": "50767915", "name": "G.
