In Taiwan, it was conventionally monitored by large environmental monitoring stations of the Environmental Protection Administration. However, only a small number of 77 monitoring stations are currently established. Recently, a project using a large number of small devices, called AirBoxes, was launched in March 2016 to monitor PM2.5 concentrations. Although thousands of AirBoxes have been deployed across Taiwan to give a broader coverage, they are mostly located in big cities and their measurements are less accurate. In this paper, we apply a robust kriging method that provides a smoothly varied real\u2010time PM2.5 concentration map and its associated standard error map. In addition, we develop a novel spatio\u2010temporal control chart that monitors anomalous measurements by utilizing neighboring AirBox information. Our method automatically adapts to different neighboring structures at different AirBox locations without the need to specify a neighborhood range. The proposed method has abilities to detect potential emission sources, malfunctioned AirBoxes, and AirBoxes that are wrongly put indoors.", "venue": "Environmetrics", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2018-10-11", "journal": {"name": "Environmetrics", "volume": "29"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2107530010", "name": "G.
