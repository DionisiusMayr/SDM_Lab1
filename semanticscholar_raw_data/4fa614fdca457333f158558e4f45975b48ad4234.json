At the same time, the scale of domestic mobile Internet market continues to expand, with more than 500 million users, bringing huge mobile Internet business data. In this context, the method of large-scale network data processing based on cloud computing big data processing technology is a very valuable research topic. From the perspective of the current situation of mobile Internet, on the one hand, mobile data services have risen sharply. And that puts a lot of pressure on the operator. Moreover, they need to invest more money in network construction and upgrading. Traditional voice and other SMS services are down. The operators then reached a point where they did not increase their earnings. Therefore, it is very important for communication operators to study the usage of large-scale mobile Internet data service resources obtained through service channels.", "venue": "2020 5th International Conference on Technologies in Manufacturing, Information and Computing (ICTMIC 2020)", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "2020 5th International Conference on Technologies in Manufacturing, Information and Computing (ICTMIC 2020)"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2119138959", "name": "Fanghai Gong"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "2c3c201968246782d0fcad7d14c3fa052023b7f7", "title": "Distributed Computer Solution Design of Tourism English Translation Strategy based on Cloud Real-Time Collaborative System"}]}
