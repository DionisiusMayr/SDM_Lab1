Proper processing of neuro-images can provide differences in brain tissues which may help in diagnosing the disease more effectively. But, due to the complex structures, this is a challenge in differentiating the brain tissues and classifying AD using traditional classification mechanisms. Deep Neural Network (DNN) is a machine learning technique that has the ability to absorb the most important information for classifying an object accurately. LeNet is a popular DNN based model with a simple and effective architecture that also consumes very less implementation time. As like most of the DNN models, LeNet also uses MaxPooling layer for dimensionality reduction by eliminating the information of minimum valued elements. In brain images low intensity valued pixels also may contain very important features. To keep the minimum valued elements too in the network, we have created a separate layer that performs Min-Pooling operation. MinPooling and MaxPooling layers are then concatenated together. Finally, we have replaced all MaxPooling Layers in LeNet by the concatenated layers. We have analysed and compared the performances of modified LeNet model with 20 other most commonly used DNN models, and some of the related works. It is observed that, the modified LeNet model achieved the highest performances. It is also observed that, original LeNet model can classify AD with a performance rate of 80%, whereas, the proposed modified LeNet model achieved an average performance rate of 96.64%.", "venue": "IEEE Access", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "IEEE Access", "pages": "161194-161207", "volume": "9"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "147913237", "name": "Ruhul Amin Hazarika"}, {"authorId": "104623485", "name": "Ajitha T.
