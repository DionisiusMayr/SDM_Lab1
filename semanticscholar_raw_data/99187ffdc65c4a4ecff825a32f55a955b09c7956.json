To test the feasibility of a deep learning (DL)\u2010based classifier as a screening tool for MSI status, we built a fully automated DL\u2010based MSI classifier using pathology whole\u2010slide images (WSIs) of CRCs. On small image patches of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) CRC WSI dataset, tissue/non\u2010tissue, normal/tumor and MSS/MSI\u2010H classifiers were applied sequentially for the fully automated prediction of the MSI status. The classifiers were also tested on an independent cohort. Furthermore, to test how the expansion of the training data affects the performance of the DL\u2010based classifier, additional classifier trained on both TCGA and external datasets was tested. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves were 0.892 and 0.972 for the TCGA and external datasets, respectively, by a classifier trained on both datasets. The performance of the DL\u2010based classifier was much better than that of previously reported histomorphology\u2010based methods. We speculated that about 40% of CRC slides could be screened for MSI status without molecular testing by the DL\u2010based classifier. These results demonstrated that the DL\u2010based method has potential as a screening tool to discriminate molecular alteration in tissue slides.", "venue": "International Journal of Cancer", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-04-13", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Cancer", "pages": "728 - 740", "volume": "149"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1459934591", "name": "Sung Hak Lee"}, {"authorId": "3721553", "name": "I.
