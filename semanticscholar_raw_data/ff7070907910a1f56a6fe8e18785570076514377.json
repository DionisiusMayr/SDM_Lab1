This survey focuses on the intelligence and spatiotemporal characteristics of four fundamental system components in ubiquitous semantic Metaverse, i.e., artificial intelligence (AI), spatiotemporal data representation (STDR), Semantic Internet of Things (SIoT), and semantic-enhanced digital twin (SDT). We thoroughly survey the representative techniques of the four fundamental system components that enable intelligent, personalized, and context-aware interactions with typical use cases of the ubiquitous semantic Metaverse, such as remote education, work and collaboration, entertainment and socialization, healthcare, and e-commerce marketing. Furthermore, we outline the opportunities for constructing the future ubiquitous semantic Metaverse, including scalability and interoperability, privacy and security, performance measurement and standardization, as well as ethical considerations and responsible AI. Addressing those challenges is important for creating a robust, secure, and ethically sound system environment that offers engaging immersive experiences for the users and AR/VR applications.", "venue": "IEEE Internet of Things Journal", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-07-13", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Internet of Things Journal", "pages": "21855-21872", "volume": "10"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2158257444", "name": "Kai Li"}, {"authorId": "2466702", "name": "Billy Pik Lik Lau"}, {"authorId": "2157408372", "name": "Xinnan Yuan"}, {"authorId": "2135558649", "name": "W.
