Load balancing is a key aspect of cloud computing and avoids the situation in which some nodes become overloaded while the others are idle or have little work to do. Load balancing can improve the Quality of Service (QoS) metrics, including response time, cost, throughput, performance and resource utilization. In this paper, we study the literature on the task scheduling and load-balancing algorithms and present a new classi \ufb01 cation of such algorithms, for example, Hadoop MapReduce load balancing category, Natural Phenomena-based load balancing category, Agent-based load balancing category, General load balancing category, application-oriented category, network-aware category, and work \ufb02 ow speci \ufb01 c category. Furthermore, we provide a review in each of these seven categories. Also. We provide insights into the identi \ufb01 cation of open issues and guidelines for future research.", "venue": "", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "17331644", "name": "Einollah Jafarnejad Ghomi"}, {"authorId": "144902225", "name": "A.
