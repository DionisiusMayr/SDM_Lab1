It enables timely and appropriate repairs to prevent system malfunctioning and reduce energy waste. In this paper, a proposed feature selection algorithm or a neurodynamic optimization algorithm based on information gain is used for selecting a certain number of significant features, and then a stacking classifier is utilized to classify data into several different fault types by using the selected features. Experimental results are elaborated to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method against baselines in terms of accuracy on most of the datasets.", "venue": "International Conference on Information and Software Technologies", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-12-08", "journal": {"name": "2023 13th International Conference on Information Science and Technology (ICIST)", "pages": "432-440"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2276983481", "name": "Xuntan Ye"}, {"authorId": "2745181", "name": "Hongzong Li"}, {"authorId": "2155754682", "name": "Jun Wang"}], "citations": []}
