Each expert is trained to analyze a portion of account information, e.g. username, and are combined to estimate the probability that the account is a bot. \nExperiments on 10 Twitter datasets show that BotBuster outperforms popular bot-detection baselines (avg F1=73.54 vs avg F1=45.12). \nThis is accompanied with F1=60.04 on a Reddit dataset and F1=60.92 on an external evaluation set.\nFurther analysis shows that only 36 posts is required for a stable bot classification. Investigation shows that bot post features have changed across the years and can be difficult to differentiate from human features, making bot detection a difficult and ongoing problem.", "venue": "International Conference on Web and Social Media", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-07-27", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2207.13658"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "14532516", "name": "L.
