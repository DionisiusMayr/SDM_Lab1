The main question is whether the emerging opportunities of the Internet of things devices can also be exploited in the industrial hospital information system landscape. This demonstrated research describes the most feasible way to integrate the Internet of things capability into hospital information production systems. The initial goal was the design and implementation of a single, unified telemedicine hub offering community-based solution for integrated medical systems. This solution allows the intercepted information to be collected and interpreted at community level. The designed and implemented system acts as a transmitter between the physician and patient. The software solution operates with sensor-based information collected from the individual. Emerging Internet of things devices and solutions open new horizons for today\u2019s health care systems.
