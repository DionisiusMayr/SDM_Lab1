Under the background, human activity recognition has drawn great attention in recent years. In this paper, we present a discriminant approach to recognize daily human activities recorded through accelerometer sensor. In the proposed approach, we first use S transform (ST) to extract features, and then introduce a supervised regularization-based robust subspace (SRRS) learning method to learn low-dimensional intrinsic feature representation from the original feature subspace. Particularly, ST has been described as a joint time-frequency representation, which is insensitive to noise. SRRS can learn more robust and discriminative features to reinforce the descriptions of samples while removing noise and redundancy. Experiments are conducted on three publicly available datasets, i.e., wireless sensor data mining, SCUT-NAA, and mHealth demonstrating the superior performance of our proposed scheme compared with state-of-the-art methods.", "venue": "IEEE Internet of Things Journal", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2019-04-01",
