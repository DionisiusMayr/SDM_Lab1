Data has become more valuable than ever in every domain, including Internet of Things(IoT) and especially Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). An important factor to maximize the production quality is to enable predictive maintenance in production. Manufacturing domain is one of the key sectors where IIoT solutions have become a necessity rather than an option to compete and shine out in the market. In this paper, a reference architectural model is proposed and applied for a manufacturing use case in practice which visualizes the immense effect of making use of big data frameworks and technologies in order to improve the predictive maintenance during the production process, resulting in the improvement of reliability.", "venue": "2022 24th International Microwave and Radar Conference (MIKON)", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-09-12", "journal": {"name": "2022 24th International Microwave and Radar Conference (MIKON)", "pages": "1-6"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2188875296", "name": "Mustafa Onur Izmitlioglu"}, {"authorId": "1898962", "name": "M.
