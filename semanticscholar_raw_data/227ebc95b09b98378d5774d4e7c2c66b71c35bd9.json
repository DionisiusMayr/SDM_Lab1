However, the large-scale installed sensors and devices expand the attack surfaces, as a vulnerable device exposed to cyber threats may also cause physical harm. Thus, monitoring and understanding cybersecurity status in a smart environment is critical. In this paper, we present the cyber-threats analysis of the layered Sigfox IoT system. To increase cybersecurity awareness in smart residential buildings, we propose visual analytic dashboards for monitoring both cybersecurity and safety status. The developed dashboards are tailored to three user groups - Admin users, House managers and Residents. Such security dashboards are applicable to other IoT use cases such as smart cities and smart logistics.", "venue": "World Forum on Internet of Things", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-10-26", "journal": {"name": "2022 IEEE 8th World Forum on Internet of Things (WF-IoT)", "pages": "1-6"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "11359837", "name": "Hanning Zhao"}, {"authorId": "1416585169", "name": "Tiina Schafeitel-T\u00e4htinen"}, {"authorId": "2220460853", "name": "Harri Verkkosaari"}, {"authorId": "2518229", "name": "Marko Helenius"}, {"authorId": "2133614", "name": "Bilhanan Silverajan"}], "citations": []}
