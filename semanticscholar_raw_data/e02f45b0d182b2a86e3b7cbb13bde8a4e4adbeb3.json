The disease severely affects the motor system and can lead to death of the patients. There is no cure available for the disease. The symptoms on motor system is seen very late which leads into difficulty in management of the disease. There is no cure for the disease which makes it more difficult when the disease is diagnosed later. For early stages of Parkinson\u2019s disease, there are some medications to improve the symptoms. There are certain symptoms like slurred speech, problems in utterances, etc. which are seen earlier. These symptoms can be leveraged to diagnose the disease in its earlier stages. Recently, computers and machine learning algorithms have been widely used in diagnosis of various diseases. Speech attributes can be analyzed using machine learning algorithms to build predictive models for detection of Parkinson\u2019s disease. In this paper, twin-support vector machine (TSVM) based on feature selection technique has been discussed along with other ML techniques for the early diagnosis of Parkinson\u2019s disease. Feature selection based TSVM has shown promising results in classification of Parkinson\u2019s disease patients from healthy subjects.", "venue": "2020 IEEE 8th R10 Humanitarian Technology Conference (R10-HTC)", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2020-12-01", "journal": {"name": "2020 IEEE 8th R10 Humanitarian Technology Conference (R10-HTC)", "pages": "1-6"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1978790638", "name": "Surendrabikram Thapa"}, {"authorId": "1992911761", "name": "Surabhi Adhikari"}, {"authorId": "2022628258", "name": "Awishkar Ghimire"}, {"authorId": "2051655985", "name": "A.
