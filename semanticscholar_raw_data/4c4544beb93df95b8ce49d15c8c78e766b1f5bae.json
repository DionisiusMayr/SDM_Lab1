Limitations arise from sensor-dependent data handling by manufacturers and user companies, hindering third-party access and comprehension. Initiatives like the European Data Act aim to enable high-quality access to sensor-generated data by regulating accuracy, completeness, and relevance while respecting intellectual property rights. Despite data availability, interoperability challenges impede sensor data reusability. For instance, sensor data shared in HTML formats requires an intricate, time-consuming processing to attain reusable formats like JSON or XML. This study introduces a methodology aimed at converting raw sensor data extracted from web portals into structured formats, thereby enhancing data reusability. The approach utilises large language models to derive structured formats from sensor data initially presented in non-interoperable formats. The effectiveness of these language models was assessed through quantitative and qualitative evaluations in a use case involving meteorological data. In the proposed experiments, GPT-4, the best performing LLM tested, demonstrated the feasibility of this methodology, achieving a precision of 93.51% and a recall of 85.33% in converting HTML to JSON/XML, thus confirming its potential in obtaining reusable sensor data.", "venue": "Italian National Conference on Sensors", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-01-01", "journal": {"name": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "volume": "24"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2149928003", "name": "Alberto Berenguer"}, {"authorId": "2278711579", "name": "Adriana Morej\u00f3n"}, {"authorId": "2269086334", "name": "David Tom\u00e1s"}, {"authorId": "145856759", "name": "J.
