In this study, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to explore the current state of research on smart healthcare for personalized healthcare. The review analyzed 482 articles from various sources, including academic journals, conference proceedings, and technical reports. The findings of this study indicate that smart healthcare for personalized healthcare is an emerging field of research with the potential to improve patient outcomes and healthcare delivery. However, the current research lacks standardization and a unified approach, making it difficult to compare and generalize the results. Furthermore, the lack of research in areas such as ethics, privacy, and security highlight the need for further investigation in these areas.", "venue": "International Conferences on Information Science and System", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-09-06", "journal": {"name": "2023 10th International Conference on ICT for Smart Society (ICISS)", "pages": "1-7"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "31064445", "name": "G.
