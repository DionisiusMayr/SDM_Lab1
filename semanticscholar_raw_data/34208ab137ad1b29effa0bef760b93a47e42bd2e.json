These data streams offer an opportunity to derive valuable insights and facilitate decision making for urban planning. However, processing and managing such data is challenging, given the size and multidimensionality of these data. Therefore, there is a growing interest in spatial approximate query processing depending on stratified-like sampling methods. However, in these solutions, as the number of strata increases, response time grows, thus counteracting the benefits of sampling. In this paper, we originally show the design and realization of a novel online geospatial approximate processing solution called GeoRAP. GeoRAP employs a front-stage filter based on the Ramer\u2013Douglas\u2013Peucker line simplification algorithm to reduce the size of study area coverage; thereafter, it employs a spatial stratified-like sampling method that minimizes the number of strata, thus increasing throughput and minimizing response time, while keeping the accuracy loss in check. Our method is applicable for various online and batch geospatial processing workloads, including complex geo-statistics, aggregation queries, and the generation of region-based aggregate geo-maps such as choropleth maps and heatmaps. We have extensively tested the performance of our prototyped solution with real-world big spatial data, and this paper shows that GeoRAP can outperform state-of-the-art baselines by an order of magnitude in terms of throughput while statistically obtaining results with good accuracy.", "venue": "Italian National Conference on Sensors", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-09-29", "journal": {"name": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "volume": "23"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "51980690", "name": "I.
