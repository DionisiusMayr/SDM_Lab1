At present, vehicles\u2019 intelligence and capabilities are rapidly improving, which will likely support many new and exciting applications. The network resources are well-utilized by exploiting neighboring vehicles\u2019 available resources while mitigating the VEC server\u2019s heavy burden. However, due to the vehicles\u2019 mobility, network topology, and the available computing resources change rapidly, which are difficult to predict. To tackle this problem, we investigate the task offloading schemes by utilizing vehicle to vehicle and vehicle to infrastructure communication modes and exploiting the vehicle\u2019s under-utilized computation and communication resources, and taking the cost and time consumption into account. We present a promising relay task-offloading scheme in vehicular edge computing (RVEC). According to this scheme, the tasks are offloaded in a vehicle to vehicle relay for computation while being transmitted to VEC servers. Numerical results illustrate that the RVEC scheme substantially enhances the network\u2019s overall offloading cost.", "venue": "PeerJ Computer Science", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-04-13", "journal": {"name": "PeerJ Computer Science", "volume": "7"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "41125832", "name": "Salman Raza"}, {"authorId": "40916002", "name": "Muhammad Ayzed Mirza"}, {"authorId": "2109859178", "name": "Shahbaz Ahmad"}, {"authorId": "3072484", "name": "M.
