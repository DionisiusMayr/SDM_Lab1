Among the recent technological advancement, high speed communication networks and Artificial Intelligence are notably the key driving factors for the evolution of such IDS from the rule-based to classic machine learning and recently, the deep learning using either manual feature engineering or representation learning techniques. This paper is a methodological literature review of various generations of machine learning-based IDS to assess their effectiveness. The review result is a pretext and blueprint for a new method that attempts to combine representation and manual feature learning techniques to effectively detect Distributed Denial of Service attacks (DDoS) in Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs).", "venue": "International Conference on Data Science, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2021-08-09", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the International Conference on Data Science, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "88882032", "name": "J.
