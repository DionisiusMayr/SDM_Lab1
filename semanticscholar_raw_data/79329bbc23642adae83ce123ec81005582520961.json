In this paper, we introduce a novel method to solve the problem as a generation task. Following the trending research of large language models (LLM) and prompt learning, the proposed method consists of three modules. Retrieval module incorporates external knowledge which is a multi-level semantic dictionary of Chinese polyphonic characters to format the sentence into a prompt. Generation module adopts the decoder-only Transformer architecture to induce the target text. Postprocess module corrects the generated text into a valid result if needed. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the existing methods on a public dataset called CPP. We also empirically study the impacts of different templates of the prompt, different sizes of training data, and whether to incorporate external knowledge.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-12-19", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2312.11920"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2275130022", "name": "Chen Li"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "1e0f707a9ad066664264682078bb1aa25d6f7c74", "title": "QACP: An Annotated Question Answering Dataset for Assisting Chinese Python Programming Learners"}]}
