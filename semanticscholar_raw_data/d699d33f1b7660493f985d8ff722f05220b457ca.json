Herein, a power\u2010managed GaN\u2010based TVNG is first proposed and a self\u2010powered wireless temperature monitoring system (SWTMS) is developed. The energy backflow from transition capacitor to TVNG is effectively suppressed by applying a high\u2010voltage\u2010resistant diode. Benefiting from the combination of the maximum power point tracking (MPPT and the buck converter, an autonomous power management unit (PMU) is designed. The internal impedance of TVNG with PMU decreases by ten times and the charging speed of capacitor increases by 7.18\u00a0times compared to those without PMU. Moreover, 100 LEDs and six parallel thermohygrometers can be constantly powered. The wireless temperature monitoring in industrial environments without external power supply is demonstrated through the developed SWTMS. This work proposes an effective power management strategy for TVNG with high output voltage, which exhibits great potential to promote the development of self\u2010powered sensors and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT).", "venue": "Advanced Energy Materials", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-03-20", "journal": {"name": "Advanced Energy Materials"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2165186391", "name": "Jie Cao"}, {"authorId": "2293731728", "name": "Zefang Dong"}, {"authorId": "2157136362", "name": "Zhi Zhang"}, {"authorId": "1397397047", "name": "Likun Gong"}, {"authorId": "89299288", "name": "Yikui Gao"}, {"authorId": "2292690730", "name": "Yiming Dai"}, {"authorId": "143778679", "name": "Guoxu Liu"}, {"authorId": "2150672566", "name": "Yuan Feng"}, {"authorId": "2198595133", "name": "Zhelin Jin"}, {"authorId": "2088827812", "name": "Ruifei Luan"}, {"authorId": "50218982", "name": "Zhaozheng Wang"}, {"authorId": "2157526637", "name": "Sicheng Dong"}, {"authorId": "2276303125", "name": "Guanggui Cheng"}, {"authorId": "2268758731", "name": "Chi Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2244168283", "name": "Jianning Ding"}], "citations": []}
