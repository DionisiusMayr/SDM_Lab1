Integration of Construction 4.0 drivers, such as business information modeling (BIM), procurement, construction safety, and structural health monitoring (SHM), with IoT devices, provides an effective framework for applications to enhance construction and operational efficiencies. IoT and Construction 4.0 driver integration research, however, is still in its infancy. It is necessary to understand the present state of IoT adoption in the Construction 4.0 context. This paper presented a comprehensive review to identify the IoT adoption status in the Construction 4.0 areas. Furthermore, this work highlighted the potential roadblocks to IoT\u2019s seamless adoption that are unique to the areas of Construction 4.0 in developing countries. Altogether, 257 research articles were reviewed to present the current state of IoT adoption in developed and developing countries, as well as the topmost barriers encountered in integrating IoT with the key Construction 4.0 drivers. This study aimed to provide a reference for construction managers to observe challenges, professionals to explore the hybridization possibilities of IoT in the context of Construction 4.0, and laymen to understand the high-level scientific research that underpins IoT in the construction industry.", "venue": "Sustainability", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-01-10", "journal": {"name": "Sustainability"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "145829754", "name": "K.
