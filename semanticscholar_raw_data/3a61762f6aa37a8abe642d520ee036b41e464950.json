The study argued that the recent developments in the field of IoT and blockchain prediction have involved the integration of innumerable classification schemes to establish a hybrid model. The introduction of the hybrid technique relies on the prediction performance that strives to override the limitations of any available architectural scheme. This study offers a comprehensive exploratory appraisal of the issues influencing the successful integration of IoT and blockchain in regards to functionality and effectiveness of security, trust, and flawless communication issues. The exploratory research methodology was used in analyzing the issues affecting the integration of blockchain, artificial intelligence (AI), and the internet of things (IoT). The findings indicated that the integration challenges influencing the effective operations of blockchain, AI, and IoT as a single system involve security, scalability, accountability, and trust of communications. The study recommends that successful and effective integration will enhance the development of new business models as well as the digital transformation of market corporations. Accordingly, new approaches to convergence should ensure that executives address the new technology demands to obtain significant gains in efficiency.", "venue": "International Journal of Computations Information and Manufacturing (IJCIM)", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2021-12-19", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Computations, Information and Manufacturing (IJCIM)"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "97584863", "name": "S.
