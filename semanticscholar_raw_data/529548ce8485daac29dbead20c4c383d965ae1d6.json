Meanwhile, advances in the symbolic reasoning capabilities of AI have led to systems that outperform humans in games like chess and Go (Silver et al., 2018). Chess commentary provides an interesting domain for bridging these two fields of research, as it requires reasoning over a complex board state and providing analyses in natural language. In this work we demonstrate how to combine symbolic reasoning engines with controllable language models to generate chess commentaries. We conduct experiments to demonstrate that our approach generates commentaries that are preferred by human judges over previous baselines.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-12-15", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2212.08195"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2116598740", "name": "Andrew Lee"}, {"authorId": "2171449416", "name": "David Wu"}, {"authorId": "31461304", "name": "Emily Dinan"}, {"authorId": "35084211", "name": "M.
