Then, each missing value in the test data set is decided by using the obtained rules. The advantage of our rule-based model is that the obtained rules are very easy to understand in comparison with other \u201dblack-box\u201d machine learning models. Furthermore, two algorithms preserve the logical property \u201dcompleteness,\u201d so they generate rules without excess and deficiency. In evaluation, the AUC measure seems unfavorable to our model, so we employed 3-fold cross-validation for the training data set, and we obtained a 94% mean score. This result ensures the validity of our model. We report several meaningful results in this experiment, as well as the estimation of missing values.", "venue": "2019 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2019-12-01", "journal": {"name": "2019 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "pages": "5888-5896"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1504656431", "name": "Zhiwen Jian"}, {"authorId": "48723587", "name": "H.
