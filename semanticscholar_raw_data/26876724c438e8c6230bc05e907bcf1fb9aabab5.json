The traditional methods are hard to remove the noise and restore the original signal. In this paper, a novel method based on fuzzy c-means clustering is proposed for EEG data preprocessing. This novel method can make up for the lack of traditional methods and can evaluate whether a certain stage of data meets the requirements. After excluding the data that does not meet the requirements, the model classification effect has been significantly improved. The proposed method has achieved a good performance across the data from the BCI competition IV dataset I.", "venue": "Cybersecurity and Cyberforensics Conference", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2018-07-01", "journal": {"name": "2018 37th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)", "pages": "9560-9563"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "81542041", "name": "Zhong-Tao Xie"}, {"authorId": "152924926", "name": "Jianguo Wang"}, {"authorId": "51436182", "name": "Wei-wei Deng"}, {"authorId": "2537953", "name": "Qiuxuan Wu"}, {"authorId": "153671298", "name": "Bang-hua Yang"}, {"authorId": "2110529808", "name": "Guo-Liang Wang"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "f8f25ef3d12d2759b3dbe710a5389dbfa8598e8a", "title": "EEG Signal Classifiaction with Optimized LSTM: A Meta-Heuristic Approach"}]}
