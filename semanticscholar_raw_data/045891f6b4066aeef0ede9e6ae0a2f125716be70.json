However, machine learning is moving to edge devices, creating the demand for AI applications at the edge, known as Edge-AI. Traditional data management practices applied in the cloud are proving to be inefficient for Edge-AI, due to resource and energy constraints of edge devices and real-time requirements of applications. This paper identifies the challenges associated with data processing for Edge-AI. We then discuss methods for efficient data processing at the edge, leading to data-centric Edge-AI. As a use case scenario, we discuss the symbolic representation of time series data and explain how it could help save the cost of data storage and processing in developing Edge-AI applications.", "venue": "International Conference on Edge Computing [Services Society]", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-07-01", "journal": {"name": "2023 IEEE International Conference on Edge Computing and Communications (EDGE)", "pages": "301-308"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "7796006", "name": "Shashikant Ilager"}, {"authorId": "39340098", "name": "Vincenzo De Maio"}, {"authorId": "24383606", "name": "Ivan Lujic"}, {"authorId": "1783686", "name": "I.
