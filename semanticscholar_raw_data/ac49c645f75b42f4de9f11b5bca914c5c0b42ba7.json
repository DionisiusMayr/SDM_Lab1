We propose adding a new construct to Epistemic Specifications called a world view constraint that provides a universal device for expressing global constraints in the various versions of the language. We further propose the use of subjective literals (literals preceded by K or M) in rule heads as syntactic sugar for world view constraints. Additionally, we provide an algorithm for finding the world views of such programs. 2012 ACM Subject Classification Software and its engineering \u2192 Constraints", "venue": "International Conference on Logic Programming", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"volume": "64"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "8507705", "name": "A.
