For data-intensive ML applications, data silos present a major challenge: the integration and transformation of data, demand a lot of manual work and computational resources. Sometimes, data cannot leave the local store, and the model has to be trained in a decentralized manner. In this work, we propose three matrix-based dataset relationship representations, which bridge the classical data integration (DI) techniques with the requirements of modern machine learning. We discuss how those matrices pave the path for utilizing DI formalisms and techniques for our vision of ML optimization and automation over data silos.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2205.09681"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "34610553", "name": "Rihan Hai"}, {"authorId": "1505828520", "name": "Yan Kang"}, {"authorId": "2073886702", "name": "Christos Koutras"}, {"authorId": "40601758", "name": "Andra Ionescu"}, {"authorId": "2138521152", "name": "Asterios Katsifodimos"}], "citations": []}
