This is because of the way students prepare their readiness to face national tests is inaccurate. On this study the hybrid method c4 algorithm.5 and the swarm particle optimization to produce a class readiness of students with high and accurate accuracy. This research suggests that by using hybridmethodC4.5 andParticle Swarm Optimizationgenerates accuracy as 97.13 %, Precisionas 96,58 %, andRecallas 100 %.
