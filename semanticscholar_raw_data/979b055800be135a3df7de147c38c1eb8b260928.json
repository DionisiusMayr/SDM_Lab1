Popular data mining approaches included decision trees or \u201cdata mining\u201d trees which consist of regression and classification trees, random forests, neural networks, and support vector machines. The advantages of each data mining approach as well as approaches to avoid overfitting are subsequently discussed. We also provide suggestions and examples for the mapping of problematic variables or classes, future or historical projections, and avoidance of model bias. Finally, we address the separate issues of parallel processing, error mapping, and incorporation of \u201cno data\u201d values into modeling processes. Given the improved availability of digital spatial products and remote sensing products, data mining approaches combined with parallel processing potentials should greatly improve the quality and extent of ecological datasets.", "venue": "GIScience & Remote Sensing", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2019-04-03", "journal": {"name": "GIScience & Remote Sensing", "pages": "406 - 429", "volume": "56"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "31989792", "name": "B.
