In STOC'18, Assadi et al. presented a distributed algorithm for maintaining an MIS with $O(1)$ (amortized) round complexity and $O(m^{3/4})$ message complexity, where $m$ denotes the dynamic number of edges in the graph. The algorithm of Assadi et al. is deterministic; to the best of our knowledge, the state-of-the-art distributed algorithm for this problem with a message complexity of $o(m^{3/4})$ incurs a round complexity of $\\Omega(m^{1/3})$. We propose a deterministic distributed algorithm that achieves an amortized message complexity of $\\tilde{O}(m^{2/3})$ and an amortized round complexity of $\\tilde{O}(1)$ under fully dynamic edge updates in the CONGEST model, where $\\tilde{O}(\\cdot)$ suppresses polylogarithmic factors.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-10-30", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2010.16177"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2007639139", "name": "Shiri Antaki"}, {"authorId": "21234724", "name": "Quanquan C.
