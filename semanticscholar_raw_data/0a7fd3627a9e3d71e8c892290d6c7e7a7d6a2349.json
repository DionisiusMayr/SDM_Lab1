This type of spatial query is characterized by a distance range over one or two datasets. The most representative and known DRQs are the \u03b5 Distance Range Query (\u03b5DRQ) and the \u03b5 Distance Range Join Query (\u03b5DRJQ). Given the increasing volume of spatial data, it is difficult to perform a DRQ on a centralized machine efficiently. Moreover, the \u03b5DRJQ is an expensive spatial operation, since it can be considered a combination of the \u03b5DR and the spatial join queries. For this reason, this paper addresses the problem of computing DRQs on big spatial datasets in SpatialHadoop, an extension of Hadoop that supports spatial operations efficiently, and proposes new algorithms in SpatialHadoop to perform efficient parallel DRQs on large-scale spatial datasets. We have evaluated the performance of the proposed algorithms in several situations with big synthetic and real-world datasets. The experiments have demonstrated the efficiency and scalability of our proposal.", "venue": "", "year": 2016, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "1410620391", "name": "Francisco Garc\u00eda-Garc\u00eda"}, {"authorId": "145747811", "name": "Antonio Corral"}, {"authorId": "1807223", "name": "L.
