Yet it can be observed that such a workflow consists of potentially many diverse components: like modules in different programming languages, database backends, or web frontends. In order to achieve high efficiency and reproducibility of the analysis, a sufficiently high level of software engineering for the different components as well as an overall software architecture that integrates and automates the different components is needed. For the use case of gene expression analysis, from a software quality point of view we analyze a newly developed web application that allows user-friendly access to the underlying workflow.", "venue": "International Database Engineering and Applications Symposium", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book"], "publicationDate": "2021-07-14", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 25th International Database Engineering & Applications Symposium"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1970342", "name": "L.
