It is not a software that you can download on your computer. These tools are used to running applications on big data which has huge in capacity,need to process quickly and can be in variety forms. To manage the big data HIVE used as a data warehouse system for Hadoop that facilitates ad-hoc queries and the analysis of large datasets stored in Hadoop .Hive provides a SQL-LIKE languages called HIVEQL. In this paper we explains how to use hive using Hadoop with a simple real time example and also explained how to create a table,load the data into table from external file ,retrieve the data from table and their different statistics like CPU time for each stage of query execution ,cumulative CPU time and time taken to fetch records.", "venue": "", "year": 2014, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2014-11-14", "journal": {"name": "International journal of engineering research and technology", "volume": "3"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "101559404", "name": "S.
