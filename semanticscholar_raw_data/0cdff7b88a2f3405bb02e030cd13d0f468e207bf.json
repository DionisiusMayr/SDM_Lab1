Indeed, the use of Big Data platforms can give way to the efficient management and analysis of large data amounts, but they require the user to concentrate on issues related to distributed computing, since their services are often too raw. The use of RAM3S greatly simplifies deploying non-parallel techniques to platforms like Apache Storm or Apache Flink, a fact that is demonstrated by the four different use cases we describe here. We detail the lessons we learned from exploiting RAM3S to implement the detailed use cases.", "venue": "International Conference on Information Integration and Web-based Applications & Services", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book"], "publicationDate": "2020-11-30", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on Information Integration and Web-based Applications & Services"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1716642", "name": "Ilaria Bartolini"}, {"authorId": "1742653", "name": "M.
