We propose an ef\ufb01cient, approximate algorithm to solve the problem of \ufb01nding frequent subgraphs in large streaming graphs. The graph stream is treated as batches of labeled nodes and edges. Our proposed algorithm \ufb01nds the set of frequent subgraphs as the graph evolves after each batch. The computational complexity is bounded to linear limits by looking only at the changes made by the most recent batch, and the historical set of frequent subgraphs. As a part of our approach, we also propose a novel sampling algorithm that samples regions of the graph that have been changed by the most recent update to the graph. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated using \ufb01ve large graph datasets, and our approach is shown to be faster than the state of the art large graph miners while maintaining their accuracy. We also compare our sampling algorithm against a well known sampling algorithm for network motif mining, and show that our sampling algorithm is faster, and capable of discovering more types of patterns. We provide theoretical guarantees of our algorithm\u2019s accuracy using the well known Chernoff bounds, as well as an analysis of the computational complexity of our approach.", "venue": "Intelligent Data Analysis", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2019-02-20", "journal": {"name": "Intell.
