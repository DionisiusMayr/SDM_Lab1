Utilizing IoT, actual items can be engaged to make, get and trade information in a consistent way. Different IoT applications center around computerizing various assignments and are attempting to enable the lifeless actual items to act with no human intercession. The current and impending IoT applications are exceptionally encouraging to build the degree of solace, effectiveness, and computerization for the clients. To have the option to execute a particularly world in a steadily developing design requires high security, protection, confirmation, and recuperation from assaults. In such manner, roll out the necessary improvements in the engineering of IoT applications for accomplishing start to finish secure IoT conditions. In this paper, a detailed review of the security-related difficulties and wellsprings of danger in IoT applications is introduced. In the wake of talking about the security issues, different arising and existing innovations zeroed in on accomplishing a serious level of confidence in IoT applications are examined. Four unique advancements: Blockchain, fog computing, edge computing and AI to expand the degree of safety in IoT are examined.", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2121457142", "name": "Darshan Deswal"}, {"authorId": "119804833", "name": "Rajiv"}, {"authorId": "2288901701", "name": "M.Tech Student"}], "citations": []}
