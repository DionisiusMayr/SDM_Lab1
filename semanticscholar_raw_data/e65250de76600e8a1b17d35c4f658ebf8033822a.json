Workflow scheduling has become one of the research trends in cloud computing as many applications in scientific, business, and big data processing can be expressed in the form of a workflow. The scheduling aims to execute scientific or synthetic workloads on the cloud by utilizing the resources by meeting QoS requirements, makespan, energy and cost. There has been extensive research in this area to schedule workflow applications in a distributed environment, to execute background tasks in IoT applications, event-driven and web applications. This paper focuses on the comprehensive survey and classification of workflow scheduling algorithms designed for the cloud.", "venue": "International Journal of Engineering and Advanced Technology", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2021-10-30", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Engineering and Advanced Technology"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2141026503", "name": "Sriperambuduri Vinay Kumar"}, {"authorId": "2207402", "name": "M.
