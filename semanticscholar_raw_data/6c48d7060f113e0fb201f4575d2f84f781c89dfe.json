Thus, in recent years, there has been much research in medical big data, mainly targeting data collection, data analysis, and visualization. However, very few works provide a full survey of the medical big data on chronic diseases and health monitoring. This review investigates recent research efforts and conducts a comprehensive overview of the work on medical big data, especially as related to chronic diseases and health monitoring. It focuses on the full cycles of the big data processing, which includes medical big data preprocessing, big data tools and algorithms, big data visualization, and security issues in big data. It also attempts to combine common big data technologies with special medical needs by analyzing in detail existing works of medical big data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey that targets chronic diseases and health monitoring big data technologies.", "venue": "IEEE Reviews in Biomedical Engineering", "year": 2018,
