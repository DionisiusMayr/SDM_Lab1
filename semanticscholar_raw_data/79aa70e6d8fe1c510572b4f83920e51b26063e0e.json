The emergence of the ChatGPT-Like large-scale language model (LLM) has begun to lead a new round of innovation in the AI field. It has extensively promoted the level of intelligence in various fields. Therefore, it is also expected further to change the application paradigm in industrial PHM and promote PHM to become intelligent. Although ChatGPT-Like LLMs have rich knowledge reserves and powerful language understanding and generation capabilities, they lack domain-specific expertise, significantly limiting their practicability in PHM applications. To this end, this study explores the ChatGPT-Like LLM empowered by the local knowledge base (LKB) in industrial PHM to solve the above limitations. In addition, we introduce the method and steps of combining the LKB with LLMs, including LKB preparation, LKB vectorization, prompt engineering, etc. Experimental analysis of real cases shows that combining the LKB with ChatGPT-Like LLM can significantly improve its performance and make ChatGPT-Like LLMs more accurate, relevant, and able to provide more insightful information. This can promote the development of ChatGPT-Like LLMs in industrial PHM and promote their efficiency and quality.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-12-06", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2312.14945"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2155242840", "name": "Huan Wang"}, {"authorId": "2144434464", "name": "Yan-Fu Li"}, {"authorId": "2276426863", "name": "Min Xie"}], "citations": []}
