Little is known regarding the link between physical inactivity and diabetic retinopathy in terms of onset, progression, and severity. This review aims to investigate these associations and understand the underlying mechanisms behind these associations. Decreased sedentary times and the inclusion of more physical activity have been linked to the delayed onset and progression of diabetic retinopathy and less severe forms of said condition. Physical activity provides both protective and anti-inflammatory effects on the retina. Further research is needed to understand and elucidate the exact mechanisms by which lack of physical activity affects retinal health and the onset, progression, and severity of diabetic retinopathy.", "venue": "Cureus", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-08-01", "journal": {"name": "Cureus", "volume": "14"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2124299802", "name": "Yousif AlQabandi"}, {"authorId": "2182107454", "name": "S.
