Facing the large-scale data processing requirements, the data center not only needs to increase the data bandwidth, but also needs to ensure the timeliness of data processing. It is increasingly unable to meet the processing requirements of high throughput and low latency. This topic adopts the stream processing architecture of heterogeneous collaborative computing based on FPGA and CPU, designs a dual-channel separated stream processing system based on FPGA network offload processing, improves the management and interaction capabilities of FPGA, reduces processing delay, and provides a set of manageable The general data real-time processing platform.", "venue": "Other Conferences", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-05-23", "journal": {"pages": "1225415 - 1225415-10", "volume": "12254"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2146874495", "name": "Yuxiang Tong"}, {"authorId": "2141165252", "name": "Xiaohui Li"}, {"authorId": "2110147797", "name": "Zhichao Zhang"}], "citations": []}
