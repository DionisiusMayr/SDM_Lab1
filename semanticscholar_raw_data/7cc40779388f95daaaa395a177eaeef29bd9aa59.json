Accuracy\u2010oriented recommender systems focus on the prediction power of algorithms and neglect that users may appreciate diverse and novel recommendations in real\u2010world scenarios. Thus, this paper proposed a multicriteria recommendation model that can optimize the recommendation accuracy, diversity, novelty, and individual tendency simultaneously. Additionally, a new multiobjective bacterial foraging optimization method is proposed to improve its searching capability and the performance of recommendation model. The proposed optimization\u2010based multicriteria recommendation algorithm is compared with existing methods on both benchmark functions and real\u2010world data sets. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is superior to other recommendation algorithms in most cases. This study provides insights in recommendation system design and draws scholarly attention to the optimization\u2010based recommendation strategy.", "venue": "International Journal of Intelligent Systems", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-10-06", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Intelligent Systems", "pages": "1618 - 1645", "volume": "37"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "151354406", "name": "S.
