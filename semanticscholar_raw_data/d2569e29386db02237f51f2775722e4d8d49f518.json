IoT considers the integration of business process models or process execution with resources of intelligent devices. The concept of process meta store (PMS) [1] optimizes the interactions between IoT devices and business processes. However, the mechanism of PMS highly depends on the meta-information of the system, associated devices, and interactions among them. In this context, a novel semantics of meta- information of process store (MIPS) for IoT-based applications is proposed in this paper. The semantics of various MIPS elements and their relationships are described using a class diagram. Further, a B+ tree-based indexing approach for the MIPS semantic is presented for efficient searching of meta-information. The semantics of MIPS are illustrated using the case study related to the clinical decision support system (CDSS). Moreover, a detailed comparative analysis has been carried out to show the expressiveness of MIPS.", "venue": "EPiC series in computing", "year": null, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "EPiC Series in Computing"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2065981066", "name": "M.
