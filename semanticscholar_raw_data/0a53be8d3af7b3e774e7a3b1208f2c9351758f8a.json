We focus on learning an embedding that maps variable-sized samples of user activity\u2013ranging from single posts to entire months of activity\u2013to a vector space, where samples by the same author map to nearby points. Our approach does not require human-annotated data for training purposes, which allows us to leverage large amounts of social media content. The proposed model outperforms several competitive baselines under a novel evaluation framework modeled after established recognition benchmarks in other domains. Our method achieves high linking accuracy, even with small samples from accounts not seen at training time, a prerequisite for practical applications of the proposed linking framework.", "venue": "North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2021-05-15", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2105.07263"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2108653632", "name": "Aleem Khan"}, {"authorId": "2093414028", "name": "Elizabeth Fleming"}, {"authorId": "2057824482", "name": "N.
