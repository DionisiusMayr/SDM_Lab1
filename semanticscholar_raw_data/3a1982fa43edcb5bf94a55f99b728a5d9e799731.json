However, assessing the bioactivities of PFASs is both time-consuming and costly due to the sheer number and expense of in vivo and in vitro biological experiments. To this end, we harnessed new unsupervised/semi-supervised machine learning models to automatically predict bioactivities of PFASs in various human biological targets, including enzymes, genes, proteins, and cell lines. Our semi-supervised metric learning models were used to predict the bioactivity of PFASs found in the recent Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report list, which contains 4730 PFASs used in a broad range of industries and consumers. Our work provides the first semi-supervised machine learning study of structure\u2013activity relationships for predicting possible bioactivities in a variety of PFAS species.", "venue": "Environmental Science and Technology Letters", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-08-26", "journal": {"name": "Environmental Science & Technology Letters", "pages": "1017 - 1022", "volume": "10"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "145953702", "name": "H.
