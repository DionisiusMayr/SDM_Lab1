A cross-sectional study was carried out among medical librarians in Pakistan by using a Modified Technology Acceptance Model (MTAM) model, with collected data analyzed using Smart-PLS. The results revealed that lack of resources, technical expertise, and some other factors were significant hurdles in smooth implementation of BDA. It is concluded that the perception of medical librarians about adoption of BDA is very encouraging, which resultantly will improve the quality of healthcare services in the country.", "venue": "Libri", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-03-15", "journal": {"name": "Libri"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2165286466", "name": "Zakria Qasmi"}, {"authorId": "143843465", "name": "R.
