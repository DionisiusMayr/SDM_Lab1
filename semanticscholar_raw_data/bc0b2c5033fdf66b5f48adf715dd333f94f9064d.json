Via interconnecting massive physical entities and their virtual twins with inter-twin and intra-twin communications, the Internet of DTs (IoDT) enables free data exchange, dynamic mission cooperation, and efficient information aggregation for composite insights across vast physical/virtual entities. However, as IoDT incorporates various cutting-edge technologies to spawn the new ecology, severe known/unknown security flaws, and privacy invasions of IoDT hinder its wide deployment. Besides, the intrinsic characteristics of IoDT, such as decentralized structure, information-centric routing, and semantic communications, entail critical challenges for security service provisioning in IoDT. To this end, this article presents an in-depth review of the IoDT with respect to system architecture, enabling technologies, and security/privacy issues. Specifically, we first explore a novel distributed IoDT architecture with cyber\u2013physical interactions and discuss its key characteristics and communication modes. Afterward, we investigate the taxonomy of security and privacy threats in IoDT, discuss the key research challenges, and review the state-of-the-art defense approaches. Finally, we point out the new trends and open research directions related to IoDT.", "venue": "IEEE Internet of Things Journal", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-01-31", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Internet of Things Journal", "pages": "14965-14987", "volume": "10"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2108901244", "name": "Yuntao Wang"}, {"authorId": "2153421121", "name": "Zhou Su"}, {"authorId": "2119113349", "name": "Shaolong Guo"}, {"authorId": "51064894", "name": "Minghui Dai"}, {"authorId": "9533837", "name": "T.
