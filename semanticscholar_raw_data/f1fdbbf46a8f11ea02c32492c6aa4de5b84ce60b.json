Finally, the system was used to detect the changes of temperature and humidity in the environment in real time for verification. The results showed that Amazon AWS cloud service platform was used to build the monitoring system, while the application layer used Spring MVC system framework in J2EE platform to realize the storage of perception data, control of equipment, and analysis of data, and developed the DEMO system by using Amazon DynamoDB NoSQL database and RDS database to jointly store data. The results of this study show that the agricultural environment IOT monitoring system based on cloud computing can better realize the monitoring of relevant parameters in the crop environment, and can lay a foundation for the development of agricultural technology of follow-up facilities.", "venue": "International Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Information Systems", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-07-01", "journal": {"name": "Int.
