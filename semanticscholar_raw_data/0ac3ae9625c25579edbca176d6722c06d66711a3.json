To ensure security, cryptographic circuits such as AES must be implemented on FPGAs. In recent years, technologies to automatically generate RTL circuits from high-level languages such as C/C++ have become popular. In this paper, we design seven AES circuits by high-level synthesis and investigate the relationship between clock constraints and security. T-tests are used to evaluate the security from four metrics. Since the correlation varies depending on the metrics, the circuit design is realized by considering not only security but also circuit performance.", "venue": "International Conference on Electronics, Information and Communications", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-02-05", "journal": {"name": "2023 International Conference on Electronics, Information, and Communication (ICEIC)", "pages": "1-2"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2211126870", "name": "Yuto Miura"}, {"authorId": "2142289862", "name": "Takumi Mizuno"}, {"authorId": "1944817137", "name": "Hiroki Nishikawa"}, {"authorId": "49623991", "name": "Xiangbo Kong"}, {"authorId": "2059442942", "name": "Hiroyuki Tomiyama"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "e40178ca5e132bb40048cddbae97658b630771a3", "title": "Impacts of Clock Frequency and Sampling Intervals on Power Side-Channel Leakage of AES Circuits"}, {"paperId": "ed901b7026b8bdf4bd0bd160f979ff48c49b843f", "title": "Simulation-based Analysis of Power Side-Channel Leakage at Different Sampling Intervals"}]}
