However, the absence of natural bandgap has limited the current on/off ratio of graphene\u2010based transistors. Vertical integration of 2D heterostructures offers a promising approach to address this challenge, enabling high\u2010current\u2010density vertical field\u2010effect transistor (VFET) with large on/off ratio. Here, a triboelectric potential\u2010powered VFET with a vertical stacked graphene/MoS2 heterostructure and a sliding\u2010mode triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) coupled with gate dielectrics are proposed. The tribotronic VFET has an ultrashort channel length in vertical direction, exhibiting excellent current driving capability with an ultrahigh on\u2010state current density of 950 A\u00a0cm\u22122 and a good current on/off ratio of 630. It also demonstrates reconfigurable diode behavior with a rectification ratio over 102. Temperature\u2010dependent studies are applied to tribotronic devices for the first time, indicating an effective modulation on the Schottky barrier height of 150 meV by the triboelectric potential. A green LED pixel is driven by the tribotronic VFET as a demonstration to work as a tactile interactive light\u2010emitting device. The demonstrated tribotronic vertical device offers a promising strategy for integrating various 2D layered materials with TENG in vertical direction, enabling 3D integration of low\u2010power and interactive devices for next\u2010generation electronics.", "venue": "Advanced Functional Materials", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-01-09", "journal": {"name": "Advanced Functional Materials"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2115569233", "name": "Yifei Wang"}, {"authorId": "2269738458", "name": "Xiangde Lin"}, {"authorId": "15795627", "name": "Guoyun Gao"}, {"authorId": "65851234", "name": "Jinran Yu"}, {"authorId": "2112557239", "name": "Yichen Wei"}, {"authorId": "2279095120", "name": "Jie Gong"}, {"authorId": "2130054900", "name": "Jia Sun"}, {"authorId": "2275509588", "name": "Zhong Lin Wang"}, {"authorId": "14459723", "name": "Qijun Sun"}], "citations": []}
