Indra, our framework for large-scale graph data, provides responsive visual analytics over large-scale graph datasets. In this study, we propose a novel graph indexing scheme that pivots the view of the graph to a hierarchical structure while preserving the semantic importance of vertices within the user's analysis scenario. Indra allows users to compare and track multiple aspects of sub-graphs by supporting linked multi-views and multi-resolution operations such as drill-in and roll-ups. We have performed a set of empirical benchmarks profiling Indra and these demonstrate that several operations are executed with sub-second latency to effectively support interactive visual analytics.", "venue": "BDCAT", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book"], "publicationDate": "2019-12-02", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 6th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Big Data Computing, Applications and Technologies"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2054679088", "name": "Samuel Armstrong"}, {"authorId": "1434550792", "name": "Kevin Bruhwiler"}, {"authorId": "145069202", "name": "S.
