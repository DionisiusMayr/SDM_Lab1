It is a distributed, scalable, secure and ad hoc scheme designed for transforming big data to the higher levels in the data-information-knowledge-wisdom hierarchy. A blocknetwork can be perceived also as a NoSQL knowledgebase. The application areas include business knowledgebase management, and open source, measurement and signature intelligence fusion with military and security purposes.", "venue": "IEEE International Conference on Consumer Electronics", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2018-07-01", "journal": {"name": "2018 IEEE Seventh International Conference on Communications and Electronics (ICCE)", "pages": "379-384"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1745949", "name": "E.
