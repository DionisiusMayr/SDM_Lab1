Advances in microelectronics technology have led to smaller and more diverse IoT devices with increased capabilities. Cloud and edge technologies are also providing these devices with efficient computing, storage, and low-latency solutions. This has led to the widespread use of IoT in a variety of areas, but it also presents an increased risk of cyberattacks, data breaches, and unauthorized access to sensitive information. However, studies and analyses of physical object security and privacy in the IoT focus on identifying and mitigating these risks. This paper studied the challenges of IoT systems and different security requirements. On the other hand, the mapping of attack methods, architecture, and security measures of physical components in IoT systems Privacy, security, and architecture requirements will be associated with physical components based on their life cycles.", "venue": "International Conference on Wireless Networks and Mobile Communications", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-10-26", "journal": {"name": "2023 10th International Conference on Wireless Networks and Mobile Communications (WINCOM)", "pages": "1-6"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2267752242", "name": "Abdelkabir Rouagubi"}, {"authorId": "2261541927", "name": "Khalid Chougdali"}], "citations": []}
