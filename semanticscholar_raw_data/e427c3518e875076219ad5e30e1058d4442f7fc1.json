It discusses the challenges of crowd\u2010sensing in the context of smart city followed by a brief overview of existing frameworks. The chapter also discusses the issues regarding task assignment, user profiling and trustworthiness, design of incentive mechanisms, localized analytics, and security and privacy. While crowd\u2010sourcing is aimed to utilize collective intelligence of the crowd to solve complex tasks by breaking them down to smaller tasks, crowd\u2010sensing splits the responsibility of gathering correct information to the crowd. Toward this, a geo\u2010social model of MCS is proposed. This model is based on a distributed architecture for task design, assessment, and execution. McSense is a framework that is also proposed for MCS. This framework talks about monetary or service incentives given to users.", "venue": "", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2017-06-30", "journal": {"name": "", "pages": "125-154", "volume": ""}, "authors": [{"authorId": "29907659", "name": "Houbing Song"}, {"authorId": "143889798", "name": "R.
