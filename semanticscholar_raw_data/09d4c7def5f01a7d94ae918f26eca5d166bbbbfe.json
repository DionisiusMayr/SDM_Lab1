Medical data is considered the input for a smart health service environment. Medical records are frequently transferred and exchanged between hospitals and research com-munities worldwide through the internet and other communication mechanisms. Medical images form a substantial share of medical data. Thus, a tremendous amount of medical images are available in a structured and unstructured manner. For easy and timely access, medical images prefer to store in cloud-based environments. Many image outbreaks have been reported in the cloud-based structure in the last decade. Hence, the above outbreaks brought the attention of the research community to developing new cloud-based security frameworks and adopting improved security algorithms for clinical images. Therefore, in this paper, the authors classify available medical image security algorithms based on adopted methodologies.", "venue": "2022 Third International Conference on Intelligent Computing Instrumentation and Control Technologies (ICICICT)", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-08-11", "journal": {"name": "2022 Third International Conference on Intelligent Computing Instrumentation and Control Technologies (ICICICT)", "pages": "887-892"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2286034036", "name": "Ajmal Mohammed"}, {"authorId": "2285923100", "name": "Dr. P.Samundiswary"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "3a5f4d5294362014ae454739db28a2dfd788f830", "title": "An XOR-based Multiple Medical Image Sharing using Visual Secret Sharing"}]}
