The use of Big Data processing systems has increased due to the availability of high performance computing resources and the realization of the value of data in making business decisions. However, configuring the parameters of these systems is difficult due to the high diversity of workloads, rapid growth of data, changing software and hardware infrastructures, and inter-dependency between the configurations. The literature has extensively explored ML-based tuners to solve the auto-tuning problem. In this essay we focus on answering four survey questions related to model generalization, search-space pruning, workload characterization, and tuning benchmarks. We follow a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) plan to answer the survey questions. As part of our SLR plan, we finalized 47 research papers and articles (published between 2012 and 2022) from different database sources. Using these papers, we perform an extensive literature review and summarize our", "venue": "", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2518101", "name": "Mayank Tiwary"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "d9b6d17c46a48cddbff9ef900e393b745813b48e", "title": "PTSSBench: a performance evaluation platform in support of automated parameter tuning of software systems"}]}
