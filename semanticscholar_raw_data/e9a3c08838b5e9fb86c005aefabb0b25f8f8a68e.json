In this model, every machine has sublinear local space of size n^\u03c6 for any arbitrary constant \u03c6 \\in (0,1). Our algorithm works under the relaxed setting where each machine is allowed to perform exponential local computations, while respecting the n^\u03c6 space and bandwidth limitations. Our key technical contribution is a novel derandomization of the ingenious (\u0394+1)-coloring local algorithm by Chang-Li-Pettie (STOC 2018, SIAM J. Comput. 2020). The Chang-Li-Pettie algorithm runs in T_local =poly(loglog n) rounds, which sets the state-of-the-art randomized round complexity for the problem in the local model. Our derandomization employs a combination of tools, notably pseudorandom generators (PRG) and bounded-independence hash functions. The achieved round complexity of O(logloglog n) rounds matches the bound of log(T_local ), which currently serves an upper bound barrier for all known randomized algorithms for locally-checkable problems in this model. Furthermore, no deterministic sublogarithmic low-space MPC algorithms for the (\u0394+1)-coloring problem have been known before.", "venue": "ACM SIGACT-SIGOPS Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2021-07-21", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 2021 ACM Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1717169", "name": "A.
