While the problem of working with data that exceeds the computing power or storage of a single computer is not new, the pervasiveness, scale, and value of this type of computing have greatly expanded in recent years. In this paper, we will take a look at one of the essential components of a big data system: processing frameworks. Processing frameworks compute over the data in the system, either by reading from non-volatile storage or as it is ingested into the system. Computing over data is the process of extracting information and insight from large quantities of individual data points.", "venue": "", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2017-12-31", "journal": {"name": "", "pages": "305-312", "volume": "5"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "72110578", "name": "V.
