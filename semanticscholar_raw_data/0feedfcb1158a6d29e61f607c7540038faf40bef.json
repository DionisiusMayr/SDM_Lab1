There are problems such as inadequate security of stored information, difficulty in controlling access rights at a fine-grained level, and untimely handling of malicious access behavior in IoT. To address these problems, an ABAC(attribute based access control) model is used as the basis for access control, and a smart contract based on attribute and reputation access control model is proposed. The solution divides the access control process into four parts and uses a combination of smart contracts and the ABAC model to achieve traceable, automated and trusted access control to the entire IoT resources. Finally, the effectiveness and compatibility of the smart contract and reputation-based access control model is verified through simulation experiments and performance tests.", "venue": "2023 4th International Conference on Information Science, Parallel and Distributed Systems (ISPDS)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-07-14", "journal": {"name": "2023 4th International Conference on Information Science, Parallel and Distributed Systems (ISPDS)", "pages": "651-656"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2238097219", "name": "Quanrun Chen"}, {"authorId": "2238204694", "name": "Huawei Zhao"}, {"authorId": "2238047185", "name": "Peng Feng"}, {"authorId": "2238044693", "name": "Wenjing Jiao"}], "citations": []}
