Using a corpus-based approach, we present a new method to distinguish evaluatively thick and thin adjectives like \u2018courageous\u2019 and \u2018awful\u2019 from descriptive adjectives like \u2018narrow,\u2019 and from value-associated adjectives like \u2018sunny.\u2019 Our study suggests that the modifiers \u2018truly\u2019 and \u2018really\u2019 frequently highlight the evaluative dimension of thick and thin adjectives, allowing for them to be uniquely classified. Based on these results, we believe our operationalization may pave the way for a more quantitative approach to the study of thick and thin concepts.", "venue": "Language and Cognition", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-08-07", "journal": {"name": "Language and Cognition"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "39729435", "name": "K.
