However, existing Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem is unable to materialize the real\u2010time bio\u2010sensor data streaming and analytics within resource constrained environment. Moreover, traditional solutions fail to mitigate the edge\u2010cloud integration within a single sub\u2010system under IoT periphery which lead to investigate how edge\u2010cloud hybridization could be realized via similar set of tools. The objective of this article is to implement an integrated dual\u2010mode edge\u2010cloud system to serve streaming and analytics in real\u2010time. This study aims to achieve the aforesaid goal by presenting two different experiments that deals with the real\u2010time pulse sensor data streaming and analytics while utilizing light\u2010weight IoT\u2010supported JavaScript frameworks that includes Node.js, Johnny\u2010Five, Serialport.js, Plotly client, Flot.js, jQUERYy, Express Server, and Socket.io. Firstly, a standalone IoT\u2010edge system is developed and later, an integrated IoT\u2010based edge\u2010cloud system is developed to compare between the effectiveness of the systems. The implementation results show near correlation between the standalone edge and dual\u2010mode edge system. However, the dual\u2010mode edge\u2010cloud system provides more flexibility and capability to counter the bio\u2010sensor data streaming and analytics services within the constrained framework.", "venue": "Transactions on Emerging Telecommunications Technologies", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-09-03", "journal": {"name": "Transactions on Emerging Telecommunications Technologies", "volume": "31"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2352513", "name": "P.
