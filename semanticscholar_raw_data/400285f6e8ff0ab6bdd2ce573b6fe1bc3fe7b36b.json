We also analyze and compare the iterations and developments of convolutional neural networks in three most commonly used areas: medical treatment, face recognition and transportation. A large number of articles have been written to understand the variations and differences of convolutional neural networks in these three areas, such as the use of different training methods or different structures, such as the time-space convolutional neural networks that will be mentioned in the article. And the last part is the summary.", "venue": "Journal of Physics: Conference Series", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Physics"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-12-01", "journal": {"name": "Journal of Physics: Conference Series", "volume": "2386"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "145705492", "name": "Sheng-Chieh Hung"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "d36ffff927635a4dfb4ce800bf1bb8bbf0f95dd5", "title": "Research on mass image classification based on CNN deep learning"}]}
