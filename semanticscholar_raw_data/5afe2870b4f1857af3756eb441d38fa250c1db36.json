To provide low latency for the aggregation query, approximate query processing can be considered as a possible alternative. In this paper, we describe the transformation rules for processing approximation queries. We present the preliminary experimental results on the performance of approximate query processing with synthetic data.", "venue": "2022 IEEE International Conference on Consumer Electronics-Asia (ICCE-Asia)", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-10-26", "journal": {"name": "2022 IEEE International Conference on Consumer Electronics-Asia (ICCE-Asia)", "pages": "1-4"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2173523", "name": "Taewhi Lee"}, {"authorId": "2115246479", "name": "C.
