However, it maintains the statistics of block of characters of size m where m is the size of the key matrix. One of the important features of the cipher matrix in Residue Number System (RNS) is that it is highly difficult and time consuming to obtain its inverse by standard inverse algorithms. Matrix in RNS does not have all the eigen values as defined in complex field. The Eigen factors of a matrix are defined as the irreducible factors of the characteristic equation (Eigen function). All the above properties are valid for cipher matrix in Galois Field. The public key is generated by using two types of matrices. One of these matrices is a self-invertible matrix or an orthonormal matrix in Galois field whereas the other matrix is a diagonally dominant matrix. Matrix inversion is very difficult and time consuming when size of matrix and modulo number are large. The computational overhead in generalized Hill cipher can be reduced substantially by using self-invertible matrices. Self-invertible matrices uses less space compared to invertible matrices. In order to overcome this problem, p(modulo) is made very large so that there would be at least p n/2 possible matrices making it extremely difficult for the intruder to find the key matrix. In this paper a Decision Based Image Encryption (DBE) algorithm is proposed that will generate self-invertible matrix for decryption based on DBE algorithm.", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "29762880", "name": "Sayyada Fahmeeda Sultana"}], "citations": []}
