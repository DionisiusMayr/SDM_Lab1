Usually, static public IP (Internet Protocol) addresses are allocated to realize the point-to-point (P2P) communication and remote controlling for smart metering systems. This, however, restricts the wide deployment of smart meters, due to the deficiency of public IP resources. This paper describes the road map architecture development of smart meter controlling system with dynamic IP addresses. We start our development from the naive architecture to a novel subscription-based communication architecture (SCA) for the support of dynamic IP addresses and group controlling of smart meters. The paper evaluates the proposed architecture by comparing the traditional P2P architecture, and validate its effectiveness to interact with smart meters.", "venue": "Annual Meeting of the IEEE Industry Applications Society", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2018-03-01", "journal": {"name": "2018 International Conference on Intelligent Autonomous Systems (ICoIAS)", "pages": "175-179"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "145746233", "name": "Pinrolinvic D.
