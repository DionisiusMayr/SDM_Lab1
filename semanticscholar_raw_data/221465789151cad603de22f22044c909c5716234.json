The chief insight behind P AIO is that if we are able to intercept and differentiate requests as they \ufb02ow through different layers of the I/O stack, we can enforce complex storage policies without signi\ufb01cantly changing the layers themselves. P AIO adopts ideas from the Software-De\ufb01ned Storage community, building data plane stages that mediate and optimize I/O requests across layers and a control plane that coordinates and \ufb01ne-tunes stages according to different storage policies. We demonstrate the performance and applicability of P AIO with two use cases. The \ufb01rst improves 99 th percentile latency by 4 \u00d7 in industry-standard LSM-based key-value stores. The second ensures dynamic per-application bandwidth guarantees under shared storage environments.", "venue": "", "year": null, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2073947633", "name": "Ricardo Macedo"}, {"authorId": "2286034952", "name": "Yusuke Tanimura"}, {"authorId": "2286024720", "name": "Jason Haga"}, {"authorId": "2286054318", "name": "Vijay Chidambaram"}, {"authorId": "2287784831", "name": "Jos\u00e9 Pereira"}, {"authorId": "145026668", "name": "J.
