It is an important basis for judging of violations and source-trace of failure in cloud service accountability. This paper presents a survey on the event connections including the features, method of discovery and correction. Most of recent research on event connections in cloud services relying on manually labeling and correcting to event connections, and a few of them have achieved automatically labeling of event connections. Finally, we give out a taxonomy of the recent research, some problems in the method of discovery and correction, and an approach in the paper.", "venue": "Conference on Electronic Information Engineering and Data Processing", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-05-26", "journal": {"pages": "1270003 - 1270003-8", "volume": "12700"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2128201638", "name": "Zhen Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2056988799", "name": "Chunhe Xia"}, {"authorId": "50342121", "name": "Shuyu Li"}, {"authorId": "2218184758", "name": "Zhiying Liu"}, {"authorId": "2218667271", "name": "Mingzhi Huang"}, {"authorId": "96726697", "name": "Cheng-Zhuan Huang"}, {"authorId": "2116337437", "name": "Xiaojian Li"}], "citations": []}
