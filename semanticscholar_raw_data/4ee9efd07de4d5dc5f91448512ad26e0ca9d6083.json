Some of such features available to teachers include logging student\u2019s activity and creating custom tests. This paper aims to: (1) Identify relationship between the student\u2019s activity on the course and their success on the self-assessment tests ; and to (2) Create behavioural profiles of students. In order to do so, the correlation analysis and cluster analysis are performed on a data set retrieved from a course implemented on the Moodle LMS at the University of Zagreb, Faculty of organization and informatics. The research results indicated the relationship between students\u00b4 activities and their performance, as well as the profiles of students based on their activities and success on tests.", "venue": "", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "", "volume": ""}, "authors": [{"authorId": "120591835", "name": "Danijel Filipovi\u0107"}, {"authorId": "145912228", "name": "Igor Balaban"}, {"authorId": "1702910", "name": "D.
