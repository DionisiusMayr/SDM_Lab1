These emerging usecases require new systems where combinations of heterogeneous sources are both allowed and efficient. \nTo tackle these challenges, we provide a simple high-level set of primitives \u2013 called HAP \u2013 to easily describe processing chains. These descriptions are then compiled into optimized SQL queries executed by Hive.", "venue": "", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2017-01-16", "journal": {"name": "", "volume": ""}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2235966", "name": "D.
