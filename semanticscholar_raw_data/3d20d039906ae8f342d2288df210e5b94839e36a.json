The paper aims to examine the role of big data in modern intelligent educational systems. For this purpose, it explores the recently published research to reveal the utilization of big data in education. Four different queries passed in Scopus scientific database are examined: \u201cbig data and education\u201d,\u201dbig data and e-learning\u201d, \u201cbig data and education and ontology\u201d, and\u201dbig data and education and artificial intelligence\u201d. After the results summarization, as a conclusion a functional architecture of an educational platform based on big data, which is constructed on six layers, is proposed. Each layer presents a different aspect of big data's influence on achieving a high-quality, secure, and trustful educational process.", "venue": "2023 International Conference on Big Data, Knowledge and Control Systems Engineering (BdKCSE)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-11-02", "journal": {"name": "2023 International Conference on Big Data, Knowledge and Control Systems Engineering (BdKCSE)", "pages": "1-8"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2267561373", "name": "Malinka Ivanova"}, {"authorId": "2274001162", "name": "Valentina Terzieva"}, {"authorId": "2121959253", "name": "T.
