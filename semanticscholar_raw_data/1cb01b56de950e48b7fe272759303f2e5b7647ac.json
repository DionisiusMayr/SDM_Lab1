The authors first introduce how to embed a course relevance decoder in an autoencoder neural network. Secondly, the proposed confidence matrix method is introduced to distinguish the recommendation effect of the learned to the unlearned courses, and the training process of the model is introduced. Then, the design content of the experiment is introduced, including the model structure, comparative experiments, parameter settings, and evaluation indicators. Finally, the experimental results are analyzed in detail from the horizontal and vertical aspects. It is hoped that this research can provide a reference for personalized recommendation of learning resources based on deep learning technology and big data analysis.", "venue": "International Journal of Information Technology and Web Engineering", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-11-08", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Information Technology and Web Engineering"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2257342513", "name": "Zhengmeng Xu"}, {"authorId": "2257134976", "name": "Hai Lin"}, {"authorId": "2265986973", "name": "Meiping Wu"}], "citations": []}
