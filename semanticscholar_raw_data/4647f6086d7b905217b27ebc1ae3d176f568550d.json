This article first examines the economic context in which autonomous driving occurs and uses statistical data to find that most of the population is receptive to autonomous driving as new and unconventional technology. This is good for the autonomous driving market. However, the survey indicates that there are still some threats to autonomous driving systems. Firstly, there are legal restrictions, and secondly, there are bottlenecks in path planning technology. It is also worth mentioning that the Tesla brake failure in 2021 has dealt a double blow to the autonomous driving industry, both socially and technologically. At the same time, the article analyses the consumption patterns of the autonomous driving industry and finds that autonomous driving is a promising industry. Still, to have a good market, it first needs to improve the technology and ensure that the data is accurate.", "venue": "BCP Business &amp; Management", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-09-06", "journal": {"name": "BCP Business &amp; Management"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2184502091", "name": "Xinyan Bai"}, {"authorId": "2184512719", "name": "Hongbing Chen"}, {"authorId": "2144794025", "name": "Xintong Jiang"}], "citations": []}
