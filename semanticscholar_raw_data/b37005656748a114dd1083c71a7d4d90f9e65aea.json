As of today, the effects of different data structures for representing null values on query processing in array databases have not been systematically studied. As a consequence, it is not clear what the optimal way for handling null values is. In this paper, we measure how four different methods for encoding null values perform across most common categories of array operations. The result is a comprehensive overview, publicly available in open source, providing relevant insights into the performance characteristics of these data structures allowing to discern which among them offers the most optimal approach for representing null values in an array processing context.", "venue": "BigData Congress [Services Society]", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-12-15", "journal": {"name": "2023 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (BigData)", "pages": "247-254"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2391793", "name": "D.
