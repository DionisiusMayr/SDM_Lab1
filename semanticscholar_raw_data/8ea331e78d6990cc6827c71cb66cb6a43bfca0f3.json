These advancements allowed us to apply some capabilities of smartphones, smart devices, and wearable devices as well. Sensory data, produced by smart devices are essential for implementing a cognitive, scalable, autonomous, and extensible Smart City architecture. Based on it, we propose an architecture which could extend Smart City solutions in a way that recognizes new data sources and applies data categorization rules without introducing any side effects for maintenance while protecting data privacy definition that complies with the GDPR and providing an anonymized data repository that is publicly available for the client consumption to further produce useful, value-added data based on analytics. Considering the evolution of smart devices, it becomes a necessity to provide an architecture definition such as microservice orchestration that allows an easier adaption of new data types and domain requirements to keep the ever-maintainable state of the Smart City architecture in a technology-agnostic fashion.
