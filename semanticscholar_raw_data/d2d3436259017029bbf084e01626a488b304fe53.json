The information of an organism's DNA is converted to digital data via a process called sequencing. A sequencing machine extracts the sequences of DNA molecules from the organism's sample in the form of strings consisting of four base pairs $(bps)$, denoted by $\\mathrm{A}, \\mathrm{C}, \\mathrm{G}$, and T. No current sequencing technology has the capability to read a human DNA molecule in its entirety. Instead, state-of-the-art sequencing machines generate randomly sampled, inexact sub-strings of the original genome, called reads. The information about the corresponding location of each read in the complete genome is lost during sequencing in most technologies. State-of-the-art sequencing machines produce one of two kinds of reads. 1) Short read sequencing technologies, such as Illumina [22], [23], produce reads that are highly accurate (99-99.9%) [24]\u2013[26], but short (e.g., up to a few hundred DNA base pairs [24], [27], [28]). 2) Long read sequencing technologies, such as Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) [29] and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) [30], produce reads that are less accurate (85-90%) [27,31\u201333], but long (e.g., lengths ranging from thousands to millions of base pairs [34]).", "venue": "IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-07-01", "journal": {"name": "2022 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI (ISVLSI)", "pages": "283-287"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1403215560", "name": "Nika Mansouri-Ghiasi"}, {"authorId": "1992941239", "name": "Jisung Park"}, {"authorId": "33145535", "name": "Harun Mustafa"}, {"authorId": "17766732", "name": "Jeremie S.
