To address this challenge, the industry is continuously developing highly efficient tools and creating more flexible engineering solutions. This work presents the integration between industry data engineering solutions for efficient data processing and academic systems developed for Named Entity Recognition (LasigeUnicage\\_NER) and Relation Extraction (BiOnt). Our design reflects an integration of those components with external knowledge in the form of additional training data from other datasets and biomedical ontologies. We used this pipeline in the 2022 LitCoin NLP Challenge, where our team LasigeUnicage was awarded the 7th Prize out of approximately 200 participating teams, reflecting a successful collaboration between the academia (LASIGE) and the industry (Unicage).
