A case\u2013control matching study was conducted in adults (n = 6396) from a suburb of Shanghai. A food frequency questionnaire was used to assess the consumption of various types of food, and B-ultrasound was used to identify kidney stones. Principal component analysis and regression were used to generate dietary patterns and further explore the relationship between dietary patterns and KSD. LASSO regression and post-selection inference were used to identify food groups most associated with KSD. Among males, the \u201cbalanced but no-sugary-beverages pattern\u201d (OR = 0.78, p < 0.05) and the \u201cnuts and pickles pattern\u201d (OR = 0.84, p < 0.05) were protective dietary patterns. Among females, \u201chigh vegetables and low-sugary-beverages pattern\u201d (OR = 0.83, p < 0.05) and \u201chigh-crustaceans and low-vegetables pattern\u201d (OR = 0.79, p < 0.05) were protective dietary patterns, while the \u201ccomprehensive pattern with a preference for meat\u201d (OR = 1.06, p < 0.05) and \u201csugary beverages pattern\u201d (OR = 1.16, p < 0.05) were risk dietary patterns. We further inferred that sugary beverages (p < 0.05) were risk factors and pickles (p < 0.05) and crustaceans (p < 0.05) were protective factors.", "venue": "Nutrients", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-01-01", "journal": {"name": "Nutrients", "volume": "16"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2115569065", "name": "Yifei Wang"}, {"authorId": "2119052154", "name": "Shaojie Liu"}, {"authorId": "2143700464", "name": "Qi Zhao"}, {"authorId": "2107252705", "name": "Na Wang"}, {"authorId": "2279073847", "name": "Xing Liu"}, {"authorId": "2278981953", "name": "Tiejun Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2257968883", "name": "Gengsheng He"}, {"authorId": "2253712119", "name": "Genming Zhao"}, {"authorId": "17316534", "name": "Yonggen Jiang"}, {"authorId": "152806987", "name": "Bo Chen"}], "citations": []}
