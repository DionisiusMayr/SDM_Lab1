Data science (DSci) as a discipline has been appropriately traced to the concern for data quality mostly as an input to complex decision-making situations based on examination through different approaches of very large volumes of data. The emerging massive data volumes in many fields of science, including remote sensing and other scientific and technological fields have fueled a review of the tenet of data quality assessment and analyses of the types of massive data that DSci relies on. In this paper we succinctly review these data quality concerns as a basis for our projects where a variety of massive data is considered.", "venue": "IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-07-16", "journal": {"name": "IGARSS 2023 - 2023 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium", "pages": "2258-2261"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1398808872", "name": "Y.
