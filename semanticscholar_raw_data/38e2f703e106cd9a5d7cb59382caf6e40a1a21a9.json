The study analyzes 4.5 million corrected and 71 uncorrected DRAM errors and it compares the reliability of DIMMs from all three major memory manufacturers, built in three different technologies. Our work has two sets of contributions. First, we illustrate the complexity of in-field DRAM error analysis and demonstrate the limitations of various widely-used methods and metrics. For example, we show that average error rates, errors per MB-hour and mean time between failures can provide volatile and unreliable results even after long periods of error logging, leading to incorrect conclusions about DRAM reliability. Second, we present formal statistical methods that overcome many of the limitations of the current approaches. The methods that we present are simple to understand and implement, reliable and widely accepted in the statistical community. Overall, our study alerts the community about the need to, firstly, question the current practice in quantifying DRAM reliability and, secondly, to select a proper analysis approach for future studies. Our strong recommendations are to focus on metrics with a practical value that could be easily related to system reliability, and to select methods that provide stable results, ideally supported with statistical significance.", "venue": "International Symposium on Memory Systems", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2019-09-30", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the International Symposium on Memory Systems"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "30444125", "name": "D.
