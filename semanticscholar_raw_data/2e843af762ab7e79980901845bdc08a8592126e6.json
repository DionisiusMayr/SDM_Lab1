Big Data is a huge collection of structured, semi-structured and unstructured data that is impossible to be processed with the existing data processing system. So, to overcome this problem Hadoop, an open source framework came into existence as a solution. With the help of Hadoop users can run their application on Hadoop clusters. This paper is aimed to demonstrate Big data characteristics, problems and challenges. This paper also represents a review on Hadoop Ecosystem & its components and discussed different domains where Big Data Analytics used.", "venue": "2019 International Conference on Smart Systems and Inventive Technology (ICSSIT)", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2019-11-01", "journal": {"name": "2019 International Conference on Smart Systems and Inventive Technology (ICSSIT)", "pages": "1-5"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "9267492", "name": "Meenakshi Saroha"}, {"authorId": "122990733", "name": "A.
