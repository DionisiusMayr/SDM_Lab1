However, QoS-focused metrics have a limited effect on the Quality of Experience (QoE) experienced by the clients. This paper proposes a Kubernetes scheduler extension and resource rescheduling that incorporates QoE metrics into SLOs. As a proof of concept, this work evaluates the architecture using the QoE metric proposed in the ITU P.1203 standard, in the context of video streaming services co-located with other services. Experimental results show that our scheduler improves the average QoE by 50% compared to other schedulers, while resource rescheduling improved the average QoE by 135%. In addition, our architecture eliminated over-provisioning altogether.", "venue": "IFIP/IEEE Symposium on Integrated Network Management", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-05-17", "journal": {"name": "2021 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM)", "pages": "286-294"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1576217226", "name": "M.
