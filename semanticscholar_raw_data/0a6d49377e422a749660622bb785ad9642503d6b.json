However, applying PETs in organizations requires a precise understanding of use cases, technologies, and limitations. This paper investigates several industrial use cases, their characteristics, and the potential applicability of PETs to these. We conduct expert interviews to identify and classify uses cases, a gray literature review of relevant open-source PET tools, and discuss how the use case characteristics can be addressed using PETs\u2019 capabilities. While we focus mainly on automotive use cases, the results also apply to other use case domains.", "venue": "2021 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2021-12-15", "journal": {"name": "2021 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "pages": "1265-1272"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1740613789", "name": "Gonzalo Munilla Garrido"}, {"authorId": "2111966322", "name": "Kaja Schmidt"}, {"authorId": "1579524882", "name": "Christopher Harth-Kitzerow"}, {"authorId": "9653883", "name": "Johannes Klepsch"}, {"authorId": "50631038", "name": "Andr\u00e9 Luckow"}, {"authorId": "2522197", "name": "F.
