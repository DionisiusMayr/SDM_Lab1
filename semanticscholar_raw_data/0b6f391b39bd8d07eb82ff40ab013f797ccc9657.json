Given the varying job workloads that characterize stream processing, these systems need to be tuned and adjusted to maintain performance targets in the face of variation in incoming traffic. Current auto-scaling systems adopt a series of trials to approach a job's expected performance due to a lack of performance modelling tools. We find that general traffic trends in most jobs lend themselves well to prediction. Based on this premise, we built a system called Caladrius that forecasts the future traffic load of a stream processing job and predicts its processing performance after a proposed change to the parallelism of its operators. Experimental results show that Caladrius is able to estimate a job's throughput performance and CPU load under a given scaling configuration.", "venue": "IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2019-04-08", "journal": {"name": "2019 IEEE 35th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE)", "pages": "1886-1897"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "8124005", "name": "Faria Kalim"}, {"authorId": "2054517511", "name": "Thomas Cooper"}, {"authorId": "2119106461", "name": "Huijun Wu"}, {"authorId": "2110976880", "name": "Yao Li"}, {"authorId": "2152171319", "name": "Ning Wang"}, {"authorId": "2054646171", "name": "Neng Lu"}, {"authorId": "40434199", "name": "Maosong Fu"}, {"authorId": "2067733088", "name": "Xiaoyao Qian"}, {"authorId": "2110564396", "name": "Hao Luo"}, {"authorId": "2053697861", "name": "Da Cheng"}, {"authorId": "153709751", "name": "Yaliang Wang"}, {"authorId": "143696573", "name": "Fred Dai"}, {"authorId": "2319032", "name": "Mainak Ghosh"}, {"authorId": "2117783202", "name": "Beinan Wang"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "d55d57ec10332532d085993b152da83bfa5ce422", "title": "Daedalus: Self-Adaptive Horizontal Autoscaling for Resource Efficiency of Distributed Stream Processing Systems"}, {"paperId": "9caf5e110d7c2013051f2d9c8547275da5c682e7", "title": "StreamBed: capacity planning for stream processing"}, {"paperId": "47e0737ac0adc6e2dccd8b02f906bdf25c227f4e", "title": "QAAS: quick accurate auto-scaling for streaming processing"}, {"paperId": "e42283730684b5c55d51ca7af30f375f4b54e4d7", "title": "Evaluation of Data Enrichment Methods for Distributed Stream Processing Systems"}, {"paperId": "047d86734c430bbf532b9fd516909add5b34facc", "title": "On combining system and machine learning performance tuning for distributed data stream applications"}, {"paperId": "e603147e665047984b7fb0f7a82def32f80ea7eb", "title": "ShadowSync: latency long tail caused by hidden synchronization in real-time LSM-tree based stream processing systems"}, {"paperId": "84565f87768f607afc2f0ee726b865568c48d300", "title": "Mjolnir: A framework agnostic auto-tuning system with deep reinforcement learning"}, {"paperId": "5ed281bcb30c45bc8f506e247703940d0432217c", "title": "Automatic Performance Tuning for Distributed Data Stream Processing Systems"}, {"paperId": "b78c4f6e49ea469a85bd7d5e669868e58fdc568b", "title": "A multi-level collaborative framework for elastic stream computing systems"}, {"paperId": "8fc9be0da3ca7dc3ca7e95e2b5b7babbaf8bcde3", "title": "Evaluation of Load Prediction Techniques for Distributed Stream Processing"}, {"paperId": "a1ee2ed9612d575fcff39d2fe04923eeed5df161", "title": "S2CE: a hybrid cloud and edge orchestrator for mining exascale distributed streams"}, {"paperId": "915ab7b6ca3633230403d47dbb31cf74888cc5c9", "title": "A Survey on Automatic Parameter Tuning for Big Data Processing Systems"}, {"paperId": "8aa026d590e877353d471c3349ed9c384a015f4a", "title": "Performance Characterization and Modeling of Serverless and HPC Streaming Applications"}]}
