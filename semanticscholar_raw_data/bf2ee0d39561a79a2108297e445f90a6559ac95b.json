DTC algorithms can be used for environmental surveillance with sensor networks and global snapshots. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient algorithm for the DTC problem. The proposed algorithm is based on a tree structure of degree n and height 2. The proposed algorithm operates in three phases depending on the remaining number of triggers. We prove the correctness of the proposed algorithm: the probability of not notifying a user even though the total number of received triggers reaches w is 0. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has lower message complexity than the best previous algorithms: CoinRand and TreeFill. MaxRcv (the maximum number of received messages per node) of the proposed algorithm is also smaller than CoinRand and TreeFill when the number of nodes is not very large.", "venue": "Electronics", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-04-02", "journal": {"name": "Electronics"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2108806012", "name": "Jaeheung Lee"}, {"authorId": "1720234", "name": "Yongsu Park"}], "citations": []}
