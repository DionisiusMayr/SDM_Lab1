Convention-ally, RL agents are sensitive to the discrepancies between the simulation and the real world, known as the sim-to-real gap. The application of domain randomization, a technique used to \ufb01ll this gap, is limited to the imposition of heuristic-randomized models. We investigate the properties of intrinsic stochasticity of real-time simulation (RT-IS) of off-the-shelf simulation software and its potential to improve the robustness of RL methods and the performance of domain randomization. Firstly, we conduct analytical studies to measure the correlation of RT-IS with the occupation of the computer hardware and validate its comparability with the natural stochasticity of a physical robot. Then, we apply the RT-IS feature in the training of an RL agent. The simulation and physical experiment results verify the feasibility and applicability of RT-IS to robust RL agent design for robot manipulation tasks. The RT-IS-powered robust RL agent outperforms conventional RL agents on robots with modeling uncertainties. It requires fewer heuristic randomization and achieves better generalizability than the conventional domain-randomization-powered agents. Our \ufb01ndings provide a new perspective on the sim-to-real problem in practical applications like robot manipulation tasks.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2304.06056"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2176105844", "name": "Ram Dershan"}, {"authorId": "2080111095", "name": "Amir M.
