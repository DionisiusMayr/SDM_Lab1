Currently, there are few indexing tools to organize video feeds beyond what is provided by a standard file system. Recent video analytic systems implement application-specific frame profiling and sampling techniques to reduce the number of raw videos processed, leveraging frame-level redundancy or manually labeled spatial-temporal correlation between cameras. This paper presents Video-zilla, a standalone indexing layer between video query systems and a video store to organize video data. We propose a video data unit abstraction, semantic video stream (SVS), based on a notion of distance between objects in the video. SVS implicitly captures scenes, which is missing from current video content characterization and a middle ground between individual frames and an entire camera feed. We then build a hierarchical index that exposes the semantic similarity both within and across camera feeds, such that Video-zilla can quickly cluster video feeds based on their content semantics without manual labeling. We implement and evaluate Video-zilla in three use cases: object identification queries, clustering for training specialized DNNs, and archival services. In all three cases, Video-zilla reduces the time complexity of inter-camera video analytics from linear with the number of cameras to sublinear, and reduces query resource usage by up to 14\u00d7 compared to using frame-level or spatial-temporal similarity built into existing query systems.", "venue": "SIGMOD Conference", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-06-10", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 2022 International Conference on Management of Data"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2118095167", "name": "Bo Hu"}, {"authorId": "3073889", "name": "Peizhen Guo"}, {"authorId": "7848960", "name": "Wenjun Hu"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "81b2834f3f884785e94a8c4c1b0bf66f858e0d97", "title": "The Image Calculator: 10x Faster Image-AI Inference by Replacing JPEG with Self-designing Storage Format"}, {"paperId": "87ab29cd19e83f6101a2d23b1d66a03f8dcab22d", "title": "Predictive and Near-Optimal Sampling for View Materialization in Video Databases"}, {"paperId": "2da3b8f8049b783911857c53df0f84843059fb53", "title": "Middleware Support for Edge Data Analytics Over Heterogeneous Scenarios"}]}
