Traditionally, clustering in web maps is done on client-side and using JavaScript. This paper explores the limitations of client-side clustering in web-based geospatial applications and describes benefits of using a server-side clustering approach. The method proposed in this paper suits static and semi-static big geodata, offering improved load times and a more engaging user experience.", "venue": "International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technologies", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-10-19", "journal": {"name": "2023 IEEE 18th International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technologies (CSIT)", "pages": "1-4"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "28327740", "name": "Maksym Arzubov"}, {"authorId": "28264659", "name": "Olga Narushynska"}, {"authorId": "37166821", "name": "A.
