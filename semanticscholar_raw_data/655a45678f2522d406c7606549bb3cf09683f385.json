These dialogue systems are attracting business attention because these do signi\ufb01cantly natural and diverse dialogues with humans. However, it has been noted that these dialogue systems re\ufb02ect gender, race, and other biases inherent in the data and may generate offensive replies or replies that agree with offensive utterances. This study examined a dialogue system that outputs appropriate replies to offensive utterances. Speci\ufb01cally, our system incorporates multiple dialogue models, each of which is specialized to suppress offensive replies in a speci\ufb01c category, then selects the most non-offensive reply from the outputs of the models. We evaluated the utility of our system when suppressing offensive replies of DialoGPT. We con\ufb01rmed ours reduces the offensive replies to less than 1%, whereas one of the state-of-the-art suppressing methods reduces to 9.8%.", "venue": "Interspeech", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-09-18", "journal": {"pages": "1076-1080"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "145007352", "name": "Naokazu Uchida"}, {"authorId": "2320220", "name": "Takeshi Homma"}, {"authorId": "2144702", "name": "Makoto Iwayama"}, {"authorId": "2106369", "name": "Yasuhiro Sogawa"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "839629148d8c1a4d8b7fe0e37c89a543b6e985d7", "title": "Can LLMs Recognize Toxicity?
