This is particularly important in scenarios where the user's intent is not explicit, such as on the homepage. Recently, personalized embedding-based systems have significantly improved the quality of recommendations and search in the e-commerce domain. However, most of these works focus on enhancing the retrieval stage. In this paper, we demonstrate that features produced by retrieval-focused deep learning models are sub-optimal for ranking stage in e-commerce recommendations. To address this issue, we propose a two-stage training process that fine-tunes two-tower models to achieve optimal ranking performance. We provide a detailed description of our transformer-based two-tower model architecture, which is specifically designed for personalization in e-commerce. Additionally, we introduce a novel technique for debiasing context in offline models and report significant improvements in ranking performance when using web-search queries for e-commerce recommendations. Our model has been successfully deployed at Yandex, serves millions of users daily, and has delivered strong performance in online A/B testing.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-10-05", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2310.03481"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2254266712", "name": "Kirill Khrylchenko"}, {"authorId": "2254265221", "name": "Alexander Fritzler"}], "citations": []}
