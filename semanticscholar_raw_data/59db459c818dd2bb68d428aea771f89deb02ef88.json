The increasing prevalence of social media has profoundly impacted our society. With the rise of social media platforms, people are now more connected than ever before, with the ability to connect with others from around the world with just a few clicks. However, the increasing use of social media has also raised concerns about its potential negative effects. One such effect is the surge of false information about events, brands, organizations, and other aspects of daily life. This resulted in trust in social media information becoming more and more significant and relevant for both businesses and consumers. This paper aims to explore the relationship between user behavior and the propagation of fake news. Specifically, it focuses on how user behavior, such as cognitive biases and social media engagement, affects the likelihood that fake news will be shared and believed.", "venue": "2023 3rd International Conference on Smart Generation Computing, Communication and Networking (SMART GENCON)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-12-29", "journal": {"name": "2023 3rd International Conference on Smart Generation Computing, Communication and Networking (SMART GENCON)", "pages": "1-7"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2136691275", "name": "A.
