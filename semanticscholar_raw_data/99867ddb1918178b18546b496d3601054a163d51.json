First, they were designed only for a single tenant, limiting the use of multiple tenants. Second, they mainly focused on designing indexes for primary key-based searches, without supporting various queries using a combination of primary key and non-primary attribute-based searches. This article proposes Cerberus, a Log Structured Merged (LSM) tree-based KVSSD armed with (1) namespace and performance isolation for multiple tenants in a multi-tenant environment and (2) capability for processing non-primary attribute-based search queries. Specifically, Cerberus identifies the tenant\u2019s namespace and splits a single large LSM-tree into namespace-specific LSM-tree indexes for tenants. Cerberus also manages secondary LSM-tree indexes to enable non-primary attribute-based data access and fast search query processing. With the SSD-internal CPU/DRAM resources, Cerberus supports non-primary attribute-based search queries and handles complex queries that are combined with search and computing operations. We prototyped Cerberus on the Cosmos+ OpenSSD platform. When there are multiple tenants, Cerberus exhibits up to 2.9\u00d7 higher read throughput and negligible write overhead compared to existing KVSSD. Cerberus also shows lower latency by up to 9.31\u00d7 for non-primary attribute-based queries.", "venue": "ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-04-11", "journal": {"name": "ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems", "pages": "1 - 27", "volume": "22"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "52198647", "name": "Donghyun Min"}, {"authorId": "2203547419", "name": "Kihyun Kim"}, {"authorId": "2214148996", "name": "Chaewon Moon"}, {"authorId": "144392776", "name": "Awais Khan"}, {"authorId": "2108155266", "name": "Seungjin Lee"}, {"authorId": "2213980141", "name": "Changhwan Yun"}, {"authorId": "6891319", "name": "Woosuk Chung"}, {"authorId": "46254372", "name": "Youngjae Kim"}], "citations": []}
