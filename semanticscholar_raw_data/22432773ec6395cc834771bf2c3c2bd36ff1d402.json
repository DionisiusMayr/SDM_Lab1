In this article, for energy saving on the mobile devices, we can use an accelerometer and a magnetometer to estimate the current user's location approaching interest of points on a game map without active GPS sensors and wireless network. In addition, we create an effective data structure with R-tree and adopt deep learning to efficiently answer the location query of Pokemons on the game location database. Our algorithm outperforms previous approaches in not only smaller running time but also in the better power consumption for the AR games on mobile devices.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Games", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-09-01", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Transactions on Games", "pages": "440-449", "volume": "15"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2006463434", "name": "Min-Chi Chiu"}, {"authorId": "2072702905", "name": "Chung-Hua Chu"}], "citations": []}
