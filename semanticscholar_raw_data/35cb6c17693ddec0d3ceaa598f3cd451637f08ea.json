Maximizing its performance is essential for many tasks but remains preliminary understood. In this work, we investigate the root causes of the scalability bottleneck of using intra-query parallelism to speedup the state-of-the-art graph-based vector search systems on multi-core architectures. Our in-depth analysis reveals several scalability challenges from both system and algorithm perspectives. Based on the insights, we propose iQAN, a parallel search algorithm with a set of optimizations that boost convergence, avoid redundant computations, and mitigate synchronization overhead. Our evaluation results on a wide range of real-world datasets show that iQAN achieves up to 37.7\u00d7 and 76.6\u00d7 lower latency than state-of-the-art sequential baselines on datasets ranging from a million to a hundred million datasets. We also show that iQAN achieves outstanding scalability as the graph size or the accuracy target increases, allowing it to outperform the state-of-the-art baseline on two billion-scale datasets by up to 16.0\u00d7 with up to 64 cores.", "venue": "ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles & Practice of Parallel Programming", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-02-25", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 28th ACM SIGPLAN Annual Symposium on Principles and Practice of Parallel Programming"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2113952229", "name": "Zhen Peng"}, {"authorId": "67016465", "name": "Minjia Zhang"}, {"authorId": "94451829", "name": "K.
