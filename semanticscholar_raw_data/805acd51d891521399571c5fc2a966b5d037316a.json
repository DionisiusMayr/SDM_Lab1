The transfer from face-to-face to virtual suggested choosing a teaching process, having e-learning as the most friendly. The method applied to the research is descriptive, correlational, transversal and predictive. The sample was applied randomly and voluntarily to 3532 university students from all over Peru, the sample was collected through an online survey. The results show that there are still problems with the materials they share due to the lack of reading comprehension, but by making use of communication technology and the Internet, students are able to take advantage of it and improve their teaching and learning through self-learning.", "venue": "International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning (iJET)", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2021-10-25", "journal": {"name": "Int.
