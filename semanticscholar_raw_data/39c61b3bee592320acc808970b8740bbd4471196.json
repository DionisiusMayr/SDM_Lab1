In addition, research areas on data analysis are diverging and integrating lots of different fields such as a business and social sector. Especially, recent researches focus on the data analysis for a better intelligent decision making and prediction system. This paper analyzes data collected from current IT learners who have already studied various IT subjects to find the IT learners\u2019 learning patterns. The most popular learning patterns are identified through an association rule data mining using an arules package running under R studio. Experimental results are used to recommend the IT learning path to rudimentary IT learners. It is expected that our research promotes IT learning field and results in a platform of IT learning helpful to IT learners.", "venue": "Journal of International Technology and Information Management", "year": 2016, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2016-10-01", "journal": {"name": "Journal of International Technology and Information Management"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "145652813", "name": "Seong-Yong Hong"}, {"authorId": "2115694889", "name": "Juyun Cho"}, {"authorId": "2012610379", "name": "Yongoh Hwang"}], "citations": []}
