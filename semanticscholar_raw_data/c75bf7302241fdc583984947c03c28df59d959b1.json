However, in advanced stream analytics such as online learning and dynamic graph analytics, enabling state sharing across different operators makes application development easier and stream processing more efficient. In addition, when stream records are timestamped, proper time semantics should be defined for both state updates and fetches. We propose a new state abstraction to address the limitations of existing systems and develop a distributed stream processing system, Nova, with native support for timestamped state sharing. We validate the expressiveness and efficiency of Nova with extensive experiments.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-11-01", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems", "pages": "2691-2704", "volume": "32"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "8890418", "name": "Yunjian Zhao"}, {"authorId": "2118358237", "name": "Zhi Liu"}, {"authorId": "47096554", "name": "Yidi Wu"}, {"authorId": "10721810", "name": "Guanxian Jiang"}, {"authorId": "1717691", "name": "James Cheng"}, {"authorId": "2118801007", "name": "Kunlong Liu"}, {"authorId": "145837716", "name": "Xiao Yan"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "341ffc8e6c7fb06ed3b3338504e4c2457d3990f4", "title": "A Survey on Transactional Stream Processing"}, {"paperId": "795e2aa8382ac65da0b1f5db5efe4ce26fb4d285", "title": "A state lossless scheduling strategy in distributed stream computing systems"}, {"paperId": "be0675c2d63559d4a4babfcf64b7dbdab1c798be", "title": "Stream processing with dependency-guided synchronization"}]}
