With this study, we explored the use of a data lake for storing and analysing data to improve scalability and interoperability. Data originated from a 2-day animal experiment in which the gait score of approximately 200 turkeys was determined through visual inspection by an expert. Additionally, inertial measurement units (IMUs), a 3D-video camera and a force plate (FP) were installed to explore the effectiveness of these sensors in automating the visual gait scoring. We deployed a data lake using the IMU and FP data of a single day of that animal experiment. This encompasses data from 84 turkeys for which we preprocessed by performing an \u2018extract, transform and load\u2019 (ETL-) procedure. To test scalability of the ETL-procedure, we simulated increasing volumes of the available data from this animal experiment and computed the \u2018wall time\u2019 (elapsed real time) for converting FP data into comma-separated files and storing these files. With a simulated data set of 30 000 turkeys, the wall time reduced from 1 h to less than 15 min, when 12 cores were used compared to 1 core. This demonstrated the ETL-procedure to be scalable. Subsequently, a machine learning (ML) pipeline was developed to test the potential of a data lake to automatically distinguish between two classses, that is, very bad gait scores v. other scores. In conclusion, we have set up a dedicated customized data lake, loaded data and developed a prediction model via the creation of an ML pipeline. A data lake appears to be a useful tool to face the challenge of storing, combining and analysing increasing volumes of data of varying nature in an effective manner.", "venue": "Animal", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-06-22", "journal": {"name": "Animal", "pages": "2397 - 2403", "volume": "14"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "6676851", "name": "D.
