Credit card frauds are increasing day by day regardless of the various techniques developed for its detection. As a result, fraud detection is the essential method and it is the best way to stop various fraud types. The classification models based on support vector machine (SVM) which is used to achieve neural network are developed and applied on credit card fraud detection problem and compares the performance of credit card details with a data set. Data is developing haphazardly for credit card and the k-means algorithm is used for discovering transaction weather it is fraud transaction or legitimate transaction.", "venue": "", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2285624397", "name": "M.Tech Student"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "a1b80e3a3a870ed08416c055fe300d9b09710f87", "title": "Prediction of Network Intrusion using an Efficient Feature Selection Method"}]}
