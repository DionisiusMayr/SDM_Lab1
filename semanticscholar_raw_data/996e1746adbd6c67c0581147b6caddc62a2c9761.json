The new recent paradigm of in-network computing employs programmable network elements to compute on the path and prior to traffic reaching the edge or cloud servers. It advances common edge/cloud server based computing through proposing line rate processing capabilities at closer locations to the end devices. This paper discusses use cases, enabler technologies and protocols for in-network computing. According to our study, considering programmable data plane as an enabler technology, potential in-network computing applications are in-network analytics, in-network caching, in-network security, and in-network coordination. There are also technology specific applications of in-network computing in the scopes of cloud computing, edge computing, 5G/6G, and NFV. In this survey, the state of the art, in the framework of the proposed categorization, is reviewed. Furthermore, comparisons are provided in terms of a set of proposed criteria which assess the methods from the aspects of methodology, main results, as well as application-specific criteria. Finally, we discuss lessons learned and highlight some potential research directions.", "venue": "IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials", "pages": "701-761", "volume": "25"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2709856", "name": "Somayeh Kianpisheh"}, {"authorId": "1682312", "name": "T.
