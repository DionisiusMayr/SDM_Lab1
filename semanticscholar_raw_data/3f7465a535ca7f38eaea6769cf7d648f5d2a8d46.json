We consider datasets D that satisfy a set of access constraints, a combination of cardinality constraints and associated indices, such that the size |DQ| of DQ and the time to identify DQ are independent of |D|, no matter how big D is. This paper studies the problem for deciding whether a query has a bounded rewriting given a set V of views and a set A of access constraints. We establish the complexity of the problem for various query languages, from \u03a33p-complete for conjunctive queries (CQ), to undecidable for relational algebra (FO). We show that the intractability for CQ is rather robust even for acyclic CQ with fixed V and A, and characterize when the problem is in PTIME. To make practical use of bounded rewriting, we provide an effective syntax for FO queries that have a bounded rewriting. The syntax characterizes a core subclass of such queries without sacrificing the expressive power, and can be checked in PTIME.", "venue": "ACM SIGACT-SIGMOD-SIGART Symposium on Principles of Database Systems", "year": 2016, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2016-06-15", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 35th ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGAI Symposium on Principles of Database Systems"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2125469004", "name": "Yang Cao"}, {"authorId": "144502903", "name": "W.
