The tool is built in a systematic way from the data sheet information of a large number of different sensors. The tool presents the main monitoring capabilities of embedded sensors on cards to assist students in the creative stages of product design. An experiment was conducted to test its educational potential with 30 Masters students in product design. The statistical analysis on the experiment data indicate that the tool enables the improvement of knowledge on embedded sensors, with a more significant gain in advanced thinking skills. Finally, the tool is easy to implement in product design education and accessible to a wide range of students.", "venue": "Proceedings of the Design Society", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-06-19", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the Design Society", "pages": "2345 - 2354", "volume": "3"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2050839564", "name": "Tristan Briard"}, {"authorId": "2052694229", "name": "Camille Jean"}, {"authorId": "1742352", "name": "A.
