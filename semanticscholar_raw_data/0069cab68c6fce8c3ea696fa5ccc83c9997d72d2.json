The proposed service model performs query rewriting according to the query input requirements of each selected service, that is, by passing the user\u2019s query conditions to the input conditions of the service, and calling the service through service binding in order to complete the extraction of the core required information. For the Web Service, the information layer is essential. This layer is in the core of sharing the heterogeneous information sources. Then, the multidimensional data mining is applied to the whole system. The novel UI is finally designed through the test.", "venue": "2022 3rd International Conference on Smart Electronics and Communication (ICOSEC)", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-10-20", "journal": {"name": "2022 3rd International Conference on Smart Electronics and Communication (ICOSEC)", "pages": "971-974"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "47796649", "name": "Yang Yang"}, {"authorId": "2192022820", "name": "Zhongqiu Xu"}, {"authorId": "2110981172", "name": "Xu Han"}], "citations": []}
