Effective and timely identification not only provides convenience to campus administrators but also helps students who are really in financial hardship. The popular using of smart cards makes it possible to identify students with financial difficulties through big data. In this paper, we collect behavioural records from undergraduate students\u2019 smart cards and propose five features by which to associate with students\u2019 poverty level. Based on these features, we proposed the Apriori Balanced Algorithm (ABA) to mine the relationship of poverty level with students\u2019 daily behaviour. Association rules show that students\u2019 poverty level is most closely related to their academic performance, followed by consumption level, diligence level, and life regularity. Finally, we adopted the semisupervised K-means algorithm to more accurately find out students with financial difficulties. Tested by classical classification algorithms, our method has a higher identification rate, which is helpful for university administrators discover students in real financial hardship effectively.", "venue": "Discrete Dynamics in Nature and Society", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2020-06-28", "journal": {"name": "Discrete Dynamics in Nature and Society"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2115772436", "name": "Yong Ma"}, {"authorId": "2153647871", "name": "Xingxu Zhang"}, {"authorId": "1770358", "name": "Xiaoqiang Di"}, {"authorId": "2136664023", "name": "T.
