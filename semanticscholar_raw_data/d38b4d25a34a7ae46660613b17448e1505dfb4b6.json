First, RSA can estimate the PF of arbitrary user-designated routes effectively by utilizing Deep Neural Network (DNN) for regression based on geographical information and spatial-temporal urban informatics. Second, our proposed Bidirectional Prioritized Spanning Tree (BDPST) intelligently combines the parallel computing concept and Gaussian mixture model (GMM) for route recommendation under users\u2019 constraints running in a timely manner. We did experiments on bus-ticket data of Tainan and Chicago and the experimental results show that the PF inference model outperforms baseline and comparative methods from 41% to 57%. Moreover, the proposed BDPST algorithm's performance is not far away from the optimal PF and outperforms other comparative methods from 39% to 71% in large-scale route recommendations.", "venue": "ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-07-03", "journal": {"name": "ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data", "pages": "1 - 36", "volume": "16"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "5961871", "name": "Fandel Lin"}, {"authorId": "2670863", "name": "Hsun-Ping Hsieh"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "3d8cfbf1b82a49dacbea4bdc41d2be62e072d103", "title": "Exploiting Network Structure in Multi-criteria Distributed and Competitive Stationary-resource Searching"}, {"paperId": "611f4ca751ebdd1ec7356fd58eb490f1a67e3217", "title": "A Grid-Based Two-Stage Parallel Matching Framework for Bi-Objective Euclidean Traveling Salesman Problem"}, {"paperId": "db661b61ba7ae75e2b39c2a9ab977267c6edad38", "title": "Traveling Transporter Problem: Arranging a New Circular Route in a Public Transportation System Based on Heterogeneous Non-Monotonic Urban Data"}, {"paperId": "e7eab4b19c6638de03b479480740e9a4097ad054", "title": "A Decision Framework to Recommend Cruising Locations for Taxi Drivers under the Constraint of Booking Information"}, {"paperId": "5314cb343b6c44beaed7137eb9796bbbafa84651", "title": "Conntrans: A Two-Stage Concentric Annealing Approach for Multi-Criteria Distributed Competitive Stationary Resource Searching"}]}
