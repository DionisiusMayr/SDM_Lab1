Certain companies with common interest effectively shares data to reduce operational cost and increases revenues. In this Project, we develop a system which provides functionality among these companies to share data with security , scalability, high performance and high throughput .It also provides elastic data sharing among these companies in a network Based P2P data management with the help of Bootstrap peer. Bootstrap peer acts as a entry point for join and departure of nodes and it also provides access control to those peer and also it manages metadata of whole network .By integrating data base and P2P technology, BestPeer++ gives low cost, flexible and scalable platform for data sharing.", "venue": "", "year": 2016, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2016-08-20", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Engineering and Computer Science", "volume": ""}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2286213761", "name": "Prof. S.
