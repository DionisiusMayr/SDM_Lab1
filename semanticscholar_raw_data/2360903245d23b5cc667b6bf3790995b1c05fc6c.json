A large portion of these datasets are delivered with the associated geospatial locations. The increased volumes of geospatial data, alongside the emerging geospatial services, pose computational challenges for large-scale geospatial analytics. We have designed and implemented STRETCH, an in-memory distributed geospatial storage that preserves spatial proximity and enables proactive autoscaling for frequently accessed data. STRETCH stores data with a delayed data dispersion scheme that incrementally adds data nodes to the storage system. STRETCH is built on Apache Spark and Ignite and interacts with them at runtime.", "venue": "IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2019-07-08", "journal": {"name": "2019 IEEE 12th International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD)", "pages": "224-228"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "97604040", "name": "B.
