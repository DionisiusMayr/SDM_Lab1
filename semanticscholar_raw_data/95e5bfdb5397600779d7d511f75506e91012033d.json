The increasing of data has been more difficult to store and analyze data using the traditional database. Apache Flink is a framework to Big Data Analytics in the large cluster. SQL-likes Query set of rules for make an interface between the user and big database, so very need to SQL To Flink translator that allow the user to run Advanced SQL Query top Flink without need writing JAVA code to reach their request, and also, Complex SQL Query in Flink is limited scalability. 2. In this paper, the system is devolved to run top Flink without changing in Flink framework. This system calls, Advanced SQL Query To Flink Translator This proposed system receives Advanced SQL Query from the user then generate Flink Code for executing this Query. Finally, it returns the results of Query to the user.", "venue": "", "year": 2016, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2016-04-06", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Applied Information Systems", "pages": "11-15", "volume": "10"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "116786468", "name": "Yasien Ghallab"}, {"authorId": "40951855", "name": "Hager Saleh"}, {"authorId": "143874864", "name": "M.
