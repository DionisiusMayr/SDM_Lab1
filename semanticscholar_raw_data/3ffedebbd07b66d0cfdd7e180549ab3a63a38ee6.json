It integrates information technology, computational intelligence, and distributed service platforms for providing classified assistance. The classified assistance ensures object detection, navigation, route identification, and messaging application support. This article introduces a novel Collaborative Computational Method (CCM) using Transfer Learning (TL) for condensed information analysis. In this method, application-centric computations are performed for decision-making and thwarting replicated and false information handling. The information is computed by exploiting the previous application-accuracy knowledge segregating different inputs. This selective computation relies on current and previous information knowledge collaboratively. The learning process is responsible for shift-based validation of computation accuracy using collaborative information. The proposed method\u2019s performance is analyzed using accuracy, computation time, complexity, and information backlogs. The proposed CCM-TL improves by 8.5% and 4.91% accuracy and information sharing. It similarly reduces computation time, complexity, and backlogs by 14.97%, 6.7%, and 16.67%, respectively.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-09-01", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking", "pages": "1355-1367", "volume": "6"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2157416175", "name": "Tu N.
