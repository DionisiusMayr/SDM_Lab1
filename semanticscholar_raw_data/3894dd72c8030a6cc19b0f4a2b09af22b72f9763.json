In this paper, a ReLU-type non-ideal memristor with a simple structure is first coupled to a classical three-dimensional Hindmarsh\u2013Rose neuron to describe the electromagnetic induction effect, which can show period-doubling, period-adding, and saddle-node bifurcations by varying the coupling strength of the memristor. Furthermore, complex discharge behaviors of the system, including bursting discharge and spiking discharge, are exhibited, and some coexisting discharge modes associated with initial values are also presented. Finally, an analog circuit scheme consuming fewer circuit components is designed, and it was found that the experimental results are consistent with the numerical results.", "venue": "AIP Advances", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-01-01", "journal": {"name": "AIP Advances"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2282400494", "name": "Yujuan Gu"}, {"authorId": "2222461511", "name": "Fei Hu"}, {"authorId": "2282237132", "name": "Xuanwei Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2059245581", "name": "Fuhong Min"}], "citations": []}
