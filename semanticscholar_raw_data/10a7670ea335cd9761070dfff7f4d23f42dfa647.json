Profiling a query in a machine who requested a query in database server improved the response time when the query is reuse to answer executed query that is subdued to a profiled query. It also avoids the utilization of database and network resources. This is because the data will be served locally as compared to obtaining the data from the original source that is still travelling in the network which entails cost not only on the database server but also in the network infrastructure. A condition in the query that limits the result set of the query was removed before it will be sent to the database for evaluation. This is to enhance the ability and usefulness of the result set of the query in answering future subdued queries to be requested. To prevent query capability duplication as well as to efficiently manage the space utilizes in the profiling of queries, profiled queries that are subdued by an incoming query was purged while queries that are subdued to profiled query was not accepted in the query logs and its result set will not be exported.", "venue": "Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Industrial and Business Engineering", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2018-10-24", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Industrial and Business Engineering"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "67272140", "name": "Ruben A.
