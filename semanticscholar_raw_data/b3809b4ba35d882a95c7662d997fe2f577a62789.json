Spatial clustering has been widely used many important societal applications, including public health and safety, transportation, environment, etc. The problem is challenging because many application domains have low-tolerance to false positives (e.g., falsely claiming a crime cluster in a community can have serious negative impacts on the residents) and clusters often have irregular shapes. In related work, the spatial scan statistic is a popular technique that can detect significant clusters but it requires clusters to have certain predefined shapes (e.g., circles, rings). In contrast, density-based methods (e.g., DBSCAN) can find clusters of arbitrary shape efficiently but do not consider statistical significance, making them susceptible to spurious patterns. To address these limitations, we first propose a modeling of statistical significance in DBSCAN based clustering. Then, we propose a baseline Monte Carlo method to estimate the significance of clusters and a Dual-Convergence algorithm to accelerate the computation. Experiment results show that significant DBSCAN is very effective in removing chance patterns and the Dual-Convergence algorithm can greatly reduce execution time.", "venue": "International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2019-08-19", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 16th International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "46269169", "name": "Yiqun Xie"}, {"authorId": "145072875", "name": "S.
