For library construction and management, traditional book management and utilization efficiency is relatively low. The introduction of big data and Internet of Things technology has brought great convenience to traditional manual management, data recording, literature statistics and other work, making the library more convenient to serve a wider range of people. This paper analyzes the current situation of library service innovation under the background of big data and Internet of Things technology, and explores the impact of new technologies on book knowledge services. On this basis, this paper puts forward the concept of intelligent library and discusses the intelligent construction of library. This paper summarizes the development status and related research status of intelligent libraries at home and abroad, and reconstructs a set of intelligent library construction schemes that meet the current technical status and user needs.", "venue": "International Conference on Software and Information Engineering", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-10-21", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Software and Information Engineering"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2148927395", "name": "Xin Zhou"}], "citations": []}
