Although researchers have made significant achievements in static analysis, it is still too challenging to perform sophisticated interprocedural analysis on large-scale modern software. The underlying reason is that interprocedural analysis for large-scale modern software is highly computation-and memory-intensive, leading to poor scalability. We aim to tackle the scalability problem by proposing a novel big data solution for sophisticated static analysis. Specifically, we propose a data-parallel algorithm and a join-process-filter computation model for the CFL-reachability based interprocedural analysis and develop an efficient distributed static analysis engine in the cloud, called BigSpa. Our experiments validated that BigSpa running on a cluster scales greatly to perform precise interprocedural analyses on millions of lines of code, and runs an order of magnitude or more faster than the existing state-of-the-art analysis tools.", "venue": "IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2019-05-01", "journal": {"name": "2019 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS)", "pages": "771-780"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "145057220", "name": "Zhiqiang Zuo"}, {"authorId": "144997442", "name": "Rong Gu"}, {"authorId": "2109909903", "name": "Xi Jiang"}, {"authorId": "2354229", "name": "Zhaokang Wang"}, {"authorId": "46844324", "name": "Yihua Huang"}, {"authorId": "1799197", "name": "Linzhang Wang"}, {"authorId": "2108262661", "name": "Xuandong Li"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "8416a403614e2793b3b64aa11fec18a557101567", "title": "Mitigating False Positive Static Analysis Warnings: Progress, Challenges, and Opportunities"}, {"paperId": "a7c2c36879fe4a2adfa528f818bedf1ccfe4ba7d", "title": "DStream: A Streaming-Based Highly Parallel IFDS Framework"}, {"paperId": "6081a3797e9ad8208d19f35ba2a2947dff582fd2", "title": "Input splitting for cloud-based static application security testing platforms"}, {"paperId": "03e55c3398e931a7a7655db4d9823c1e3cb0bcbf", "title": "DFI: An Interprocedural Value-Flow Analysis Framework that Scales to Large Codebases"}, {"paperId": "27f155758647e9dcd296f003b78dd21de60017bb", "title": "Systemizing Interprocedural Static Analysis of Large-scale Systems Code with Graspan"}, {"paperId": "756aba5677478edbd39534e5ecb150da73470452", "title": "Chianina: an evolving graph system for flow- and context-sensitive analyses of million lines of C code"}, {"paperId": "b64be6555eec3de33a0b50104c2a2735892ad4c8", "title": "Towards Efficient Large-Scale Interprocedural Program Static Analysis on Distributed Data-Parallel Computation"}, {"paperId": "e827572a52ff97553da5cccc939e40880da4ac07", "title": "Scaling Up the IFDS Algorithm with Efficient Disk-Assisted Computing"}, {"paperId": "dc34121ad8670fe4915343b8f2297e196242f5ec", "title": "Memory-Efficient Fixpoint Computation"}]}
