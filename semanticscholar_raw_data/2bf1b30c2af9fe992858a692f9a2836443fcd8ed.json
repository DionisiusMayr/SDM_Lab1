However, ensuring the security of these systems is of utmost importance due to the potentially severe consequences of cyber attacks. This article presents an overview of ICS security, covering its components, protocols, industrial applications, and performance aspects. It also highlights the typical threats and vulnerabilities faced by these systems. Moreover, the article identifies key factors that influence the design decisions concerning control, communication, reliability, and redundancy properties of ICS, as these are critical in determining the security needs of the system. The article outlines existing security countermeasures, including network segmentation, access control, patch management, and security monitoring. Furthermore, the article explores the integration of machine learning techniques to enhance the cybersecurity of ICS. Machine learning offers several advantages, such as anomaly detection, threat intelligence analysis, and predictive maintenance. However, combining machine learning with other security measures is essential to establish a comprehensive defense strategy for ICS. The article also addresses the challenges associated with existing measures and provides recommendations for improving ICS security. This paper becomes a valuable reference for researchers aiming to make meaningful contributions within the constantly evolving ICS domain by providing an in-depth examination of the present state, challenges, and potential future advancements.", "venue": "Italian National Conference on Sensors", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-10-30", "journal": {"name": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "volume": "23"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2264391911", "name": "Mary Nankya"}, {"authorId": "35933201", "name": "Robin Chataut"}, {"authorId": "1751180", "name": "R.
