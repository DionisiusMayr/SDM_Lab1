Here, $n$ is an upper bound on the number of active points at any time, and $\\Delta$ is the aspect ratio of the data. Previously, the best known amortized update time was $O(k^2\\cdot \\operatorname{polylog}(n,\\Delta))$, and is due to Chan, Gourqin, and Sozio. We demonstrate that the runtime of our algorithm is optimal up to $\\operatorname{polylog}(n,\\Delta)$ factors, even for insertion-only streams, which closes the complexity of fully dynamic $k$-centers clustering. In particular, we prove that any algorithm for $k$-clustering tasks in arbitrary metric spaces, including $k$-means, $k$-medians, and $k$-centers, must make at least $\\Omega(n k)$ distance queries to achieve any non-trivial approximation factor. Despite the lower bound for arbitrary metrics, we demonstrate that an update time sublinear in $k$ is possible for metric spaces which admit locally sensitive hash functions (LSH). Namely, we demonstrate a black-box transformation which takes a locally sensitive hash family for a metric space and produces a faster fully dynamic $k$-centers algorithm for that space. In particular, for a large class of metrics including Euclidean space, $\\ell_p$ spaces, the Hamming Metric, and the Jaccard Metric, for any $c>1$, our results yield a $c(4+\\epsilon)$ approximate $k$-centers solution in $O(n^{1/c} \\cdot \\operatorname{polylog}(n,\\Delta))$ amortized update time, simultaneously for all $k \\geq 1$. Previously, the only known comparable result was a $O(c \\log n)$ approximation for Euclidean space due to Schmidt and Sohler, running in the same amortized update time.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-12-13", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2112.07050"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "70638610", "name": "M.
