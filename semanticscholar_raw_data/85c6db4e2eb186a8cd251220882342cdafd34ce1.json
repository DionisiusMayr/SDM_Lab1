The choice of RDF partitioning techniques and storage formats using SparkSQL significantly impacts query performance. The impact of the relational schemas and the underlying data storage formats is indisputable; they significantly affect the query performance. Nevertheless, the trade-offs in different configurations have not been a subject of intensive study in the literature. This paper presents an in-depth investigation for practitioners to understand such trade-offs and their best practices. It also reports on the pitfalls behind the implementation SPARQL optimizations over SparkSQL . Our experiments provide insights into these schemas\u2019 relative strengths by comparing three different partitioning techniques and four other storage formats. Our results draw a better understanding of the current State-Of-The-Art (S.O.T.A) and pave the way for a wide range of best practices and systematically tuning the performance of distributed systems to handle vast RDF data.", "venue": "International Workshop on Data Warehousing and OLAP", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"pages": "71-80"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2065777089", "name": "Mohamed Ragab"}, {"authorId": "50271459", "name": "Riccardo Tommasini"}, {"authorId": "17663383", "name": "Feras M.
