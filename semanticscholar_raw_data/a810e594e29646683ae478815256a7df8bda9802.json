The European Central Bank has recently announced an action plan to include climate change considerations in its monetary policy strategy. This action plan also foresees the development of statistical indicators for climate change risk analysis covering green financial instruments, the carbon footprint of financial institutions and their exposures to climate-related physical risks. In this paper, we cover the derivation of physical risk indicators, which require the application of new methods for central bank statisticians, borrowed from geographers, meteorologist, climate scientists and disaster management experts. First, we present the necessary data layers, covering: i) location, ii) physical hazards, such as floods, earthquakes, wildfires, landslides, and subsidence, iii) assets exposures to those physical hazards, and iv) final potential impact stemming from the realization of the hazards. Second, we briefly describe available data sources and procedures for linking climate with financial information from heterogenous datasets including public and commercial data providers. Finally, we propose experimental statistical indicators of physical hazard, testing consistency of various specifications across data sources and spatial aggregation.", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "15154414", "name": "C.
