Moreover, HVAC problems might have an impact on occupants\u2019 discomfort in thermal comfort. Hence, the identification of the root cause of HVAC problems is imperative for facility managers to plan preventive and corrective maintenance actions. However, due to the complex interaction between various equipment and the lack of data integration among Facility Management (FM) systems, they fail to provide necessary information to identify the root cause of HVAC problems. Building Information Modelling (BIM) is a potential solution for maintenance activities to address the challenges of information reliability and interoperability. Therefore, this paper presents a novel conceptual model and user-centric framework to determine the causes of HVAC problems implemented in BIM for its visualization. CMMS and BMS data were integrated into BIM and utilized by the framework to analyze the root cause of HVAC problems. A case study in a university building was used to demonstrate the applicability of the approach. This framework assists the FM team to determine the most probable cause of an HVAC problem, reducing the time to detect equipment faults, and providing potential actions to solve them.", "venue": "Energies", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-05-17", "journal": {"name": "Energies"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "120350679", "name": "Hamid Alavi"}, {"authorId": "3002715", "name": "N.
