The RDBMS provides a natural starting point, given its mature infrastructure for fast data access and processing, along with support for enterprise features (e.g., encryption, auditing, high-availability). To take advantage of all of the above, we need to address a key concern: Can in-RDBMS scoring of ML models match (outperform?) the performance of dedicated frameworks? We answer the above positively by building Raven, a system that leverages native integration of ML runtimes (i.e., ONNX Runtime) deep within SQL Server, and a unified intermediate representation (IR) to enable advanced cross-optimizations between ML and DB operators. In this optimization space, we discover the most exciting research opportunities that combine DB/Compiler/ML thinking. Our initial evaluation on real data demonstrates performance gains of up to 5.5x from the native integration of ML in SQL Server, and up to 24x from cross-optimizations--we will demonstrate Raven live during the conference talk.", "venue": "Conference on Innovative Data Systems Research", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2019-11-01", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/1911.00231"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2687553", "name": "Konstantinos Karanasos"}, {"authorId": "2192580", "name": "Matteo Interlandi"}, {"authorId": "40413768", "name": "Doris Xin"}, {"authorId": "2493657", "name": "Fotis Psallidas"}, {"authorId": "3133317", "name": "Rathijit Sen"}, {"authorId": "2116811298", "name": "Kwanghyun Park"}, {"authorId": "39953499", "name": "I.
