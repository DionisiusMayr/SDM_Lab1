Using Dex protocol, we can integrate a SQL database system and a big data system into a unified data analysis platform. The integrated system allows users to call complex analytics functions available in the big data analytics system with a simple SQL statement. We prototype our idea on Postgresql and Spark and demostrate promising performance gains against pure SQL UDF solutions.", "venue": "International Conference on Cloud Computing and Big Data", "year": 2016, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2016-11-01", "journal": {"name": "2016 7th International Conference on Cloud Computing and Big Data (CCBD)", "pages": "110-115"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2053144282", "name": "Manyi Cai"}, {"authorId": "38902965", "name": "Tongxin Bai"}, {"authorId": "2072995702", "name": "Min Cheng"}, {"authorId": "144486540", "name": "Chengzhong Xu"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "05a02d93acb2906745c18ffa4a92fea888dd3882", "title": "Towards Elastic Data Warehousing by Decoupling Data Management and Computation"}]}
