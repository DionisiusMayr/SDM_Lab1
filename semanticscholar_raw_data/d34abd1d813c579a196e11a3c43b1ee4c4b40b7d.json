In this regard, they proposed a novel local binary descriptor capable of extracting more informative and discriminative local features for the purpose of gender classification. Traditional Local binary patterns include information about the relationship between a central pixel value and those of its neighboring pixels in a very compact manner. In the proposed method the authors incorporate into the descriptor more information from the neighborhood by using extra patterns. They have evaluated their approach on the standard FERET and CAS-PEAL databases and the experiments show that the proposed approach offers superior results compared to techniques using state-of-the-art descriptors such as LBP, LDP and HoG. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed system with 98.33% classification accuracy.", "venue": "Int. J. Multim. Data Eng.
