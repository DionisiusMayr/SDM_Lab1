Other religions have found themselves in a similar situation, and they were practically forced to move online, which is an unprecedented occasion. In this paper, we analyse this sudden change in religious activities twofold: we create and deliver a questionnaire, as well as analyse Twitter data, to understand people\u2019s perceptions and activities related to religious activities online. Importantly, we also analyse the temporal variations in this process, by analysing a period of 3 months: July-September 2020. Additionally to the separate analysis of the two data sources, we also discuss the implications from triangulating the results.", "venue": "BigData Congress [Services Society]", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-12-11", "journal": {"name": "2023 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (BigData)", "pages": "5704-5713"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1395899459", "name": "O.
