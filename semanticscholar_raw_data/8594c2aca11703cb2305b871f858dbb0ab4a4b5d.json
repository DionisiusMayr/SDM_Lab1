When dealing with huge amount of data, instead of migrating to more performant and costly hardware platforms, or buying resources in cloud, it is more affordable to add a number of cheaper servers as nodes for data processing and/or storage. NoSQL data stores, Hadoop ecosystems, NewSQL platforms have proved viable for Big Data storage and processing. In this paper we were concerned with setting up a platform for big data processing using commodity workstations. Many small and medium sized companies have limited resources and their workstations remain unused for more than 12 hours a day. Here Beowulf Cluster Computing could prove useful. Apache Impala was installed as part of a Hadoop distribution on a 9-node cluster. Three TPC-H database schema were loaded for the scale factors of 1, 2 and 10GB. A series of 100 SQL queries were randomly generated and executed for each scale factor. Results were collected and analyzed for determining if the cluster can provide a decent level of data processing performance.", "venue": "International Conference on Computer Systems and Technologies", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book"], "publicationDate": "2018-09-13", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Computer Systems and Technologies"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2024188", "name": "Marin Fotache"}, {"authorId": "1409494457", "name": "Valerica Greavu-Serban"}, {"authorId": "72908598", "name": "Ionut Hrubaru"}, {"authorId": "117464635", "name": "Alexandru Tica"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "312354c70fbd87b95e67cd654ebaa7c32c228a52", "title": "Low Cost Big Data Solutions: The Case of Apache Spark on Beowulf Clusters"}]}
