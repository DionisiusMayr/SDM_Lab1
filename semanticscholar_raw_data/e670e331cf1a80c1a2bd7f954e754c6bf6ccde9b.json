Scheduling LLAs needs to support complex placement constraints (e.g., to run multiple containers of an application on different machines) and larger degrees of parallelism to provide global optimization. But existing schedulers usually suffer severe constraint violations, high latency and low resource efficiency. This paper describes Aladdin, a novel cluster scheduler that can maximize resource efficiency while avoiding constraint violations: (i) it proposes a multidimensional and nonlinear capacity function to support constraint expressions; (ii) it applies an optimized maximum flow algorithm to improve resource efficiency. Experiments with an Alibaba workload trace from a 10,000-machine cluster show that Aladdin can reduce violated constraints by as mush as 20%. Meanwhile, it improves resource efficiency by 50% compared with state-of-the-art schedulers.", "venue": "IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2019-05-20", "journal": {"name": "2019 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS)", "pages": "696-707"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1471242321", "name": "Heng Wu"}, {"authorId": "2108185473", "name": "Wen-bo Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2125754544", "name": "Yuanjia Xu"}, {"authorId": "2064889137", "name": "Hao Xiang"}, {"authorId": "145281930", "name": "Tao Huang"}, {"authorId": "2113455216", "name": "Haiyang Ding"}, {"authorId": "2148906226", "name": "Zhenguo Zhang"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "3032ab013743817466267b79c90cd8f7bd23a3b9", "title": "Towards Dynamic Request Updating With Elastic Scheduling for Multi-Tenant Cloud-Based Data Center Network"}, {"paperId": "de3c36e2f38e880b427d29d5179867e103db91d0", "title": "A Multi-Swarm PSO Approach to Large-Scale Task Scheduling in a Sustainable Supply Chain Datacenter"}, {"paperId": "f826ceb8e94c360b43663ec2ea3a9ace2ad93131", "title": "Learning Scheduling Policies for Co-Located Workloads in Cloud Datacenters"}, {"paperId": "69fe63781479a70ccd52d5f5680d2a51206aba33", "title": "Resource-aware multi-task offloading and dependency-aware scheduling for integrated edge-enabled IoV"}, {"paperId": "281a3752b999b93e22da59268ca92a7142ac6919", "title": "SLearn: A Case for Task Sampling Based Learning for Cluster Job Scheduling"}, {"paperId": "0461eb6662224baee9b062ed8678fb66f072fec0", "title": "A deep reinforcement learning-based optimization method for long-running applications container deployment"}, {"paperId": "60e0ab6b443147b46dd193402c7d3db583aecce2", "title": "Modeling of Diverse Computing Requirements in Azure Task Traces"}, {"paperId": "dbad5700ae29a7edda960dba32df92a144a74948", "title": "Edgedrones: Co-Scheduling of Drones for Multi-Location Aerial Computing Missions"}, {"paperId": "2cf7973d70364263e1414d7fc78fe8178866538e", "title": "Holistic Resource Scheduling for Data Center In-Network Computing"}, {"paperId": "05250f1a9d9713f1dab6a69af596d7c3b843802e", "title": "Affinity-Aware Resource Provisioning for Long-Running Applications in Shared Clusters"}, {"paperId": "908861c5f751ab61152f793b8e339ff81be58c6e", "title": "Efficient Dynamic Deployment of Simulation Tasks in Collaborative Cloud and Edge Environments"}, {"paperId": "9c1b979b8ba820a712e3198f5cede008a89acbbd", "title": "On the Potential of Execution Traces for Batch Processing Workload Optimization in Public Clouds"}, {"paperId": "cb870b8b4dcb3d021155f5902bc0285aeb722293", "title": "George: Learning to Place Long-Lived Containers in Large Clusters with Operation Constraints"}, {"paperId": "d037f3df7bcad91c18f394855054abf990f7bb40", "title": "Switches for HIRE: resource scheduling for data center in-network computing"}, {"paperId": "82336295513221f4ceeca5246d664f28cfda4321", "title": "Metis: Learning to Schedule Long-Running Applications in Shared Container Clusters at Scale"}, {"paperId": "2dd26d9a99d37b29f5925d7fd707083a21dd8eca", "title": "ThermoSim: Deep Learning based Framework for Modeling and Simulation of Thermal-aware Resource Management for Cloud Computing Environments"}, {"paperId": "e9e93e4eb6090cfa0628ffbd26b59495f2a4f784", "title": "Efficient Flow-Based Scheduling for Geo-Distributed Simulation Tasks in Collaborative Edge and Cloud Environments"}, {"paperId": "32e3deba6cd6125f48687c9e75b4054e37329091", "title": "Understanding Data Centers from Logs: Leveraging External Knowledge for Distant Supervision"}, {"paperId": "dc930a3b202f7a45718cdab9cfa6392fd54063e2", "title": "University of Birmingham ThermoSim"}]}
