The MPC model has become very popular as a model for large-scale distributed computing and it comes with the constraint that the memory-per-machine is strongly sublinear in the input size. For graph problems, extremely fast MPC algorithms have been designed assuming $\\tilde{\\Omega}(n)$ memory-per-machine, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the graph (e.g., the $O(\\log\\log n)$ MIS algorithm of Ghaffari et al., PODC 2018). However, it has proven much more difficult to design fast MPC algorithms for graph problems in the low-memory MPC model, where the memory-per-machine is restricted to being strongly sublinear in the number of nodes, i.e., $O(n^\\eps)$ for $0 < \\eps < 1$. \nIn this paper, we present an algorithm for the 2-ruling set problem, running in $\\tilde{O}(\\log^{1/6} \\Delta)$ rounds whp, in the low-memory MPC model. We then extend this result to $\\beta$-ruling sets for any integer $\\beta > 1$. Specifically, we show that a $\\beta$-ruling set can be computed in the low-memory MPC model with $O(n^\\eps)$ memory-per-machine in $\\tilde{O}(\\beta \\cdot \\log^{1/(2^{\\beta+1}-2)} \\Delta)$ rounds, whp. From this it immediately follows that a $\\beta$-ruling set for $\\beta = \\Omega(\\log\\log\\log \\Delta)$-ruling set can be computed in in just $O(\\beta \\log\\log n)$ rounds whp. The above results assume a total memory of $\\tilde{O}(m + n^{1+\\eps})$. We also present algorithms for $\\beta$-ruling sets in the low-memory MPC model assuming that the total memory over all machines is restricted to $\\tilde{O}(m)$.", "venue": "Foundations of Software Technology and Theoretical Computer Science", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2020-09-26", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2009.12477"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3235932", "name": "Kishore Kothapalli"}, {"authorId": "13179363", "name": "Shreyas Pai"}, {"authorId": "1766252", "name": "S.
