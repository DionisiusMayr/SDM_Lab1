This is because most systems cannot accurately detect the geospatial semantic elements from the natural language questions, or capture the semantic relationships between those elements.\u00a0In this paper, we propose a geospatial semantic encoding schema and a semantic graph representation which captures the semantic relations and dependencies in geospatial questions.\u00a0We demonstrate that our proposed graph representation approach aids in the translation from natural language to a formal, executable expression in a query language.\u00a0To decrease the need for people to provide explanatory information as part of their question and make the translation fully automatic, we treat the semantic encoding of the question as a sequential tagging task, and the graph generation of the query as a semantic dependency parsing task.\u00a0We apply neural network approaches to automatically encode the geospatial questions into spatial semantic graph representations.\u00a0Compared with current template-based approaches, our method generalises to a broader range of questions, including those with complex syntax and semantics.\u00a0Our proposed approach achieves better results on GeoData201 than existing methods.", "venue": "Journal of Spatial Information Science", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2021-12-24", "journal": {"name": "Journal of Spatial Information Science"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "49404498", "name": "Haonan Li"}, {"authorId": "4095133", "name": "E.
