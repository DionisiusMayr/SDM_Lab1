Inspired by the torque balance that exists in gravitational interactions when galaxies merge, we propose a novel clustering method based on two natural properties of the universe: mass and distance. The concept of torque describing the interactions of mass and distance forms the basis of the proposed parameter-free clustering algorithm, which harnesses torque balance to recognize any cluster, regardless of shape, size, or density. The gravitational interactions govern the merger process, while the concept of torque balance reveals partitions that do not conform to the natural order for removal. Experiments on benchmark data sets show the enormous versatility of the proposed algorithm.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-04-27", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2004.13160"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2119894176", "name": "Jie Yang"}, {"authorId": "2146113861", "name": "Chin-Teng Lin"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "82c72c8b59f88881dec26f7b8df9679384f07c4e", "title": "Multi-View Adjacency-Constrained Nearest Neighbor Clustering (Student Abstract)"}]}
