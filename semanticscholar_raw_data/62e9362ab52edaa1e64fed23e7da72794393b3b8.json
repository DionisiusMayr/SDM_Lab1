To maximize this potential, we propose the creation of a trading market to encourage interactions between service supporters (vehicle pla-toons) and requesters (task vehicles). Current trading decisions based on game and negotiations can lead to unpredicted handover costs and increased communication overhead in dynamic environments. Moreover, existing research tends to overlook a mutually beneficial trading philosophy by focusing on either the service supporters\u2019 profitability or the user experience of resource-restrained requesters. Addressing these issues, we introduce a multi-objective optimization problem to model environmental dynamics and uncertainty, aiming to maximize both platoons\u2019 and task vehicles\u2019 long-term utilities while maintaining a satisfactory service access ratio. To tackle the problem within acceptable time frames, we develop a global-local training architecture, incorporating a hybrid action space and prioritized sampling into a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm that utilizes a twin delayed deep deterministic gradient (GL-HPMATD3). This approach facilitates consensus in the trading market on key issues, including service request selection, resource allocation, and", "venue": "IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2061135203", "name": "Tingting Xiao"}, {"authorId": "4562384", "name": "Chen Chen"}, {"authorId": "1714082", "name": "M.
