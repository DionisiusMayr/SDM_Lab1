Of the 237 studies that the search yielded, 11 were included.\n\n\nFindings\nThe results showed that among the opportunities offered by IoT is that it not only brings the introduction of information and communication technology into the classroom, but also enhances student interest, thus, improving the quality of teaching in higher education. On the other hand, one of the challenges it faces is the attitude of teachers towards its adoption, as well as the level of digital competence of teachers.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThis study presents how higher education institutions are including the IoT in their educational activities. The IoT refers to a network of digital interconnectivity between devices, people and the internet itself that enables the exchange of data between them, allowing key information about the use and performance of devices and objects to be captured to detect patterns, make recommendations, improve efficiency and create better user experiences.\n", "venue": "Interactive Technology and Smart Education", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-08-08", "journal": {"name": "Interactive Technology and Smart Education"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1399682848", "name": "J.
