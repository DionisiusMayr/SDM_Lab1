Analysis of these challenges becomes computationally expensive with higher penetration of electric vehicles due to various preferences, travel behavior, and the battery size of electric vehicles. This problem can be addressed using clustering methods which have been successfully used in many other sectors. Recently, there have been several studies published on applying clustering methods for various aspects of electric vehicles. To summarize the existing efforts and provide future research directions, this contribution presents a three-step analysis. First, the existing clustering methods, including hard and soft clustering, are discussed. Then, the recent literature on the application of clustering methods for different aspects of electric vehicles is reviewed. The review concentrates on four major aspects of electric vehicles: the behavior of the user, driving cycle, used batteries, and charging stations. Then, several representative studies are selected from each category and their merits and demerits are summarized. Finally, gaps in the existing literature are identified and directions for future research are presented. They indicate the need for further research on the impact on distribution circuits, charging infrastructure during emergencies, equity and disparity in rebate allocations, and the use of big data with cluster analysis to assist transportation network management.", "venue": "Electronics", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-02-04", "journal": {"name": "Electronics"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2134419884", "name": "Masooma Nazari"}, {"authorId": "2082387968", "name": "Akhtar Hussain"}, {"authorId": "1730121", "name": "P.
