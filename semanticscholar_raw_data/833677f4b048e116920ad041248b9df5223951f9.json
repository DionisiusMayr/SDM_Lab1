However, complex and diverse radiology reports with cross-source heterogeneity pose a huge generalizability challenge to the current methods under massive data volume, mainly because the style and normativity of radiology reports are obviously distinctive among institutions, body regions inspected and radiologists. Recently, the advent of large language models (LLM) offers great potential for recognizing signs of health conditions. To resolve the above problem, we collaborate with the Second Xiangya Hospital in China and propose ChatRadio-Valuer based on the LLM, a tailored model for automatic radiology report generation that learns generalizable representations and provides a basis pattern for model adaptation in sophisticated analysts' cases. Specifically, ChatRadio-Valuer is trained based on the radiology reports from a single institution by means of supervised fine-tuning, and then adapted to disease diagnosis tasks for human multi-system evaluation (i.e., chest, abdomen, muscle-skeleton, head, and maxillofacial $\\&$ neck) from six different institutions in clinical-level events. The clinical dataset utilized in this study encompasses a remarkable total of \\textbf{332,673} observations. From the comprehensive results on engineering indicators, clinical efficacy and deployment cost metrics, it can be shown that ChatRadio-Valuer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models, especially ChatGPT (GPT-3.5-Turbo) and GPT-4 et al., in terms of the diseases diagnosis from radiology reports. ChatRadio-Valuer provides an effective avenue to boost model generalization performance and alleviate the annotation workload of experts to enable the promotion of clinical AI applications in radiology reports.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-10-08", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2310.05242"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2215167446", "name": "Tianyang Zhong"}, {"authorId": "2225952818", "name": "Wei Zhao"}, {"authorId": "2257095790", "name": "Yutong Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2221032216", "name": "Yi Pan"}, {"authorId": "2256986792", "name": "Peixin Dong"}, {"authorId": "2184750732", "name": "Zuowei Jiang"}, {"authorId": "2256988701", "name": "Xiaoyan Kui"}, {"authorId": "2190311870", "name": "Youlan Shang"}, {"authorId": "2257129705", "name": "Li Yang"}, {"authorId": "2163675860", "name": "Yaonai Wei"}, {"authorId": "2237381357", "name": "Longtao Yang"}, {"authorId": "2261381541", "name": "Hao Chen"}, {"authorId": "2257372663", "name": "Huan Zhao"}, {"authorId": "2237390142", "name": "Yuxiao Liu"}, {"authorId": "2244031110", "name": "N.
