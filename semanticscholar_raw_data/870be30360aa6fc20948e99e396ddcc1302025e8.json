The availability of vaccines in the U.S. is a relief. However, many people are not in favor of the COVID-19 vaccine. The study aimed to identify the emotions and themes of discourse related to the COVID-19 vaccine posted on Twitter. Sentiment analysis and topic modeling techniques were employed to discover the sentiment and prevalent themes. The findings suggest that overall, the public has positive opinions towards the vaccine. Those people that show positive opinions appreciate the efforts of leadership, medical experts and pharmaceutical companies in developing the COVID-19 vaccine. They are feeling hopeful and relieved as the vaccines are/will be available. There are also people that hold negative attitudes towards the vaccines because of disbelief in the government and concerns about the efficacy and adverse reactions caused by the vaccines. \u00a9 AMCIS 2021.", "venue": "Americas Conference on Information Systems", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "27th Annual Americas Conference on Information Systems, AMCIS 2021"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "30909384", "name": "Kruttika Sutrave"}, {"authorId": "1415188871", "name": "Rajesh Godasu"}, {"authorId": "9756930", "name": "Jun Liu"}], "citations": []}
