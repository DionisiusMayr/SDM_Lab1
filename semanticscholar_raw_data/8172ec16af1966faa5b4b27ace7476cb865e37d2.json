It combines a language-integrated automatic differentiation system and multiple Tensor implementations within a modern ahead-of-time compiled language oriented around mutable value semantics. The resulting platform has been validated through use in over 30 deep learning models and has been employed across data center and mobile applications.", "venue": "Conference on Machine Learning and Systems", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-02-26", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2102.13243"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "4125424", "name": "Brennan Saeta"}, {"authorId": "51293138", "name": "Denys Shabalin"}, {"authorId": "47745426", "name": "M.
