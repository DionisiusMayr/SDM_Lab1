This challenge is characterized by various instabilities, such as reward hacking and catastrophic forgetting. In this technical report, we propose two innovations to stabilize RLHF training: 1) Advantage Model, which directly models advantage score i.e., extra reward compared to the expected rewards and regulates score distributions across tasks to prevent reward hacking. 2) Selective Rehearsal, which mitigates catastrophic forgetting by strategically selecting data for PPO training and knowledge rehearsing. Our experimental analysis on public and proprietary datasets reveals that the proposed methods not only increase stability in RLHF training but also achieve higher reward scores and win rates.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-09-18", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2309.10202"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1780690", "name": "Baolin Peng"}, {"authorId": "1748796", "name": "Linfeng Song"}, {"authorId": "2243391254", "name": "Ye Tian"}, {"authorId": "2936180", "name": "Lifeng Jin"}, {"authorId": "2013337", "name": "Haitao Mi"}, {"authorId": "2239076081", "name": "Dong Yu"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "8b57632b19df9ebd3e57e3adbef7fc6ec93bc506", "title": "HyperCLOVA X Technical Report"}, {"paperId": "9732c864d1d4161fcb106f2961d9a80dd4fffc9a", "title": "Dense Reward for Free in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback"}, {"paperId": "485f8a429cf5f70c558181187f2d62e31784deaa", "title": "Reasons to Reject?
