This mobile communication link has paved way to easily complete the day-to-day human activities. The Internet of Things (IoT) technology has created a smart and connected human society, where every gadget and application remains connected to one another by utilizing the open network called internet. By monitoring objects in real time, IoT simplifies the manual monitoring operations. This paper discusses several IoT models, functionality and various security and privacy challenges. Security is one of the significant characteristics considered at every stage. The vulnerabilities in IoT will be examined in this article along with security strategies for dealing with them. Security techniques such as Blockchain, Cloud Computing, and Machine Learning with Artificial Intelligence have improved the ability to ensure that security metrics for IoT devices. Further, the current statistics of IoT attacks are increasing day by day. This research study will discuss about IoT and related technologies.", "venue": "2022 3rd International Conference on Smart Electronics and Communication (ICOSEC)", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-10-20", "journal": {"name": "2022 3rd International Conference on Smart Electronics and Communication (ICOSEC)", "pages": "526-534"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "116834910", "name": "Vidushi Verma"}, {"authorId": "35071481", "name": "Munish Bhatia"}], "citations": []}
