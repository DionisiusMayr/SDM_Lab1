However, authorization vulnerabilities resulting from broken access controls have been common in the past. Existing techniques to detect such vulnerabilities require manual effort and suffer from false positives as automating authorization vulnerability detection in an app agnostic way is challenging. We present two subproblems automated discovery of app resources and automated detection of authorization vulnerabilities. This thesis attempts to solve these subproblems by introducing AuthZee, a tool designed to automatically discover resources in a web app and automatically detect if those resources are vulnerable to improper authorization, without requiring details about the app logic. We propose a novel way of crawling using an evolutionary algorithm to generate app objects and triad testing for detection. AuthZee requires login credentials for three user accounts in the target app which allows it to crawl user account space and perform triad testing. Upon testing with 7 popular open source web applications diverse in size and logic, we find that our approach is able to discover more resources than existing crawling techniques and perform detection with 0 false positives in most apps.", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2173991877", "name": "Akshay Kawlay"}], "citations": []}
