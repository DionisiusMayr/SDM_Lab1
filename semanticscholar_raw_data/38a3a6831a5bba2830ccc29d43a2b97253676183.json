However, modern video data management systems are largely designed to process individual streams of video data as if they were independent and unrelated. In this paper, we present VisualWorldDB, a vision and an initial architecture for a new type of database management system optimized for multi-video applications. VisualWorldDB ingests video data from many perspectives and makes them queryable as a single multidimensional visual object . It incorporates new techniques for optimizing, executing, and storing multi-perspective video data. Our preliminary results suggest that this approach allows for faster queries and lower storage costs, improving the state of the art for applications that operate over this type of video data.", "venue": "Conference on Innovative Data Systems Research", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "", "volume": ""}, "authors": [{"authorId": "144843868", "name": "Brandon Haynes"}, {"authorId": "102780514", "name": "Maureen Daum"}, {"authorId": "19170117", "name": "Amrita Mazumdar"}, {"authorId": "1718134", "name": "M.
