However, modern OLTP applications usually have changing workloads or access patterns, so how to make the resource provisioning elastic to the changing workloads becomes an important design goal for a deterministic database system.\n Live migration,\n which moves the specified data from a source machine to a destination node while continuously serving the incoming transactions, is a key technique required for the elasticity. In this paper, we present MgCrab, a live migration technique for a deterministic database system, that leverages the\n determinism\n to maintain the consistency of data on the source and destination nodes at very low cost during a migration period. We implement MgCrab on an open-source database system. Extensive experiments were conducted and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of MgCrab.\n", "venue": "Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2019-01-01", "journal": {"name": "Proc.
