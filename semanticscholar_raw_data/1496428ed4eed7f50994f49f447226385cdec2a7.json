The software-defined network (SDN) represents one of these enabling technologies, providing an integrated improvement over the traditional vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET). Due to the centralized characteristics of SDN, they are vulnerable to attacks that may result in life-threatening situations. Securing SDN-based VANETs is vital and requires incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. Hence, this work proposed an intrusion detection model (IDM) to identify Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks in the vehicular space. The proposed solution employs the radial basis function (RBF) kernel of the support vector machine (SVM) classifier and an exhaustive parameter search technique called grid search cross-validation (GSCV). In this framework, the proposed architecture can be deployed on the onboard units (OBUs) of each vehicle, which receive the vehicular data and run intrusion detection tasks to classify a message sequence as a DDoS attack or benign. The performance of the proposed algorithm compared to other ML algorithms using key performance metrics. The proposed framework is validated through experimental simulations to demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting DDoS intrusion. Using the GridSearchCV, optimal values of the RBF-SVM kernel parameters \u201cC\u201d and \u201cgamma\u201d $(\\gamma)$ of 100 and 0.1, respectively, gave the optimal performance. The proposed scheme showed an overall accuracy of 99.33%, a detection rate of 99.22%, and an average squared error of 0.007, outperforming existing benchmarks.", "venue": "IEEE Internet of Things Journal", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-05-15", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Internet of Things Journal", "pages": "8477-8490", "volume": "10"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2216348043", "name": "Goodness Oluchi Anyanwu"}, {"authorId": "83425262", "name": "C.
