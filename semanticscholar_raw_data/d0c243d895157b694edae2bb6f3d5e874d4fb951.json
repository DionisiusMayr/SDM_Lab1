The epitome of smart city development has become possible due to the latest innovative integration of information and communication technology. Citizens of smart cities can enjoy the benefits of a smart living environment, ubiquitous connectivity, seamless access to services, intelligent decision making through smart governance, and optimized resource management. The widespread acceptance of smart cities has raised data security issues, authentication, unauthorized access, device\u2010level vulnerability, and sustainability. This article focuses on the holistic overview and conceptual development of smart city. Initially, the work discusses the smart city idea and fundamentals explored in various pieces of literature. Further various smart city applications along with notable implementations, are put forth to understand the quality of living standards. Finally, the article depicts a solid understanding of different security and privacy issues, including some crucial future research directions.", "venue": "Expert Syst. J. Knowl.
