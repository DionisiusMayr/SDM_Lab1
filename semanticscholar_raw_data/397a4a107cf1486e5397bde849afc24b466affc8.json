The concept offers numerous benefits for consumers that alters how users interact with the technology. With this said, however, such monumental growth within IoT development also gives rise to a number of legal and technical challenges in the field of IoT forensics. Indeed, there exist many issues that must be overcome if effective IoT investigations are to be carried out. This paper presents a review of the IoT concept, digital forensics and the state-of-the-art on IoT forensics. Furthermore, an exploration of the possible solutions proposed in recent research and IoT forensics challenges that are identified in the current research literature are examined. Picks apart the challenges facing IoT forensics which have been established in recent literature. Overall, this paper draws attention to the obvious problems \u2013 open problems which require further efforts to be addressed properly.", "venue": "International Conference on Complex Information Systems", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2019-05-02", "journal": {"pages": "106-115"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "144901593", "name": "A.
