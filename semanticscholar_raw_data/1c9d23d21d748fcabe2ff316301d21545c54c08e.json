We introduce a customized FPGA design based on the established integer point enumeration in fundamental parallelepiped algorithm. Through experimentation, we evaluate the performance of this FPGA-accelerated design in comparison to C and traditional Python implementations across a set of 12 test instances. Our experiments reveal a significant computational speedup for the C implementation, ranging from 83% to 100%, compared to the Python implementation. FPGA implementation can speed up the C version about 10x up to dimension 9. But beyond that, the I/O operations due to the lack of memory, make FPGA slower than C although the computation times are still better.", "venue": "International Conference on Electrical and Electronics Engineering", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-11-30", "journal": {"name": "2023 14th International Conference on Electrical and Electronics Engineering (ELECO)", "pages": "1-5"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2235757574", "name": "Gizem S\u00fcng\u00fc Terci"}, {"authorId": "3093976", "name": "A.
