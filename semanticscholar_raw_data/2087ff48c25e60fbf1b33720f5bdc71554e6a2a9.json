Accurate quick reading and classification of the electricity consumption of residential users can provide a more in-depth perception of the actual power consumption of residents, which is essential to ensure the normal operation of the power system, energy management and planning. Based on the distributed architecture of cloud computing, this paper designs an improved random forest residential electricity classification method. It uses the unique out-of-bag error of random forest and combines the Drosophila algorithm to optimize the internal parameters of the random forest, thereby improving the performance of the random forest algorithm. This method uses MapReduce to train an improved random forest model on the cloud computing platform, and then uses the trained model to analyze the residential electricity consumption data set, divides all residents into 5 categories, and verifies the effectiveness of the model through experiments and feasibility.", "venue": "Computer systems science and engineering", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "Comput.
