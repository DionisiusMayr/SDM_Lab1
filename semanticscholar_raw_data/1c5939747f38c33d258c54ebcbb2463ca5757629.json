Disregarding its apparently straightforward information show, RDF really encodes rich and complex diagrams blending both case and mapping level information. Shading such information utilizing established methods or apportioning the diagram utilizing conventional min-slice calculations prompts to exceptionally wasteful appropriated operations and to a high number of joins. In this paper, we portray DiploCloud, a productive and versatile appropriated RDF information administration framework for the cloud. In spite of past methodologies, DiploCloud runs a physiological investigation of both occurrence and composition data before parceling the information. In this paper, we depict the design of DiploCloud, its fundamental information structures, and in addition the new calculations we use to parcel and disseminate information. We likewise introduce a broad assessment of DiploCloud demonstrating that our system is frequently two requests of size quicker than state-of-the-art systems on standard workloads.", "venue": "", "year": 2015, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2015-12-30", "journal": {"name": "", "pages": "7-12", "volume": "1"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2155776078", "name": "Jae Yoon Lee"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "1bcdc74b5785cbd9531a386fe7b5ceeab729f658", "title": "A Study on Public Open Data Service Using Linked Open Data(LOD) Technology"}]}
