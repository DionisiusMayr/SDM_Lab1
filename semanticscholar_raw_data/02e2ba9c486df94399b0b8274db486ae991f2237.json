This data collected from different enterprises and government agencies often includes private and sensitive information, which needs to be secured from unauthorized access. This paper proposes extensions to the current authorization capabilities offered by Hadoop core and other ecosystem projects, specifically Apache Ranger and Apache Sentry. We present a fine-grained attribute-based access control model, referred as HeABAC, catering to the security and privacy needs of multi-tenant Hadoop ecosystem. The paper reviews the current multi-layered access control model used primarily in Hadoop core (2.x), Apache Ranger (version 0.6) and Sentry (version 1.7.0), as well as a previously proposed RBAC extension (OT-RBAC). It then presents a formal attribute-based access control model for Hadoop ecosystem, including the novel concept of cross Hadoop services trust. It further highlights different trust scenarios, presents an implementation approach for HeABAC using Apache Ranger and, discusses the administration requirements of HeABAC operational model. Some comprehensive, real-world use cases are also discussed to reflect the application and enforcement of the proposed HeABAC model in Hadoop ecosystem.", "venue": "", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2018-03-14", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the Third ACM Workshop on Attribute-Based Access Control"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "11690554", "name": "Maanak Gupta"}, {"authorId": "2761637", "name": "Farhan Patwa"}, {"authorId": "145692602", "name": "R.
