Many healthcare systems have been developed using blockchain technology in these years which has used traditional databases as their database to store records which is a centralised database. In this paper, we have proposed blockchain database bigchaindb for storing medical records which is decentralized, immutable, and has control on the assets over the network. Also, we have constructed a web framework using Django which connects with blockchain database BigchainDB. This model verifies and validates the transactions that are stored in the database BigchainDB. Finally, we have implemented a prototype called healthcare blockchain using bigchaindb which gives security to the medical records stored in the database which is a scalable blockchain database and includes the features of decentralised control, tamper resistant, immutability, fault tolerance, and advanced access control.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2158599738", "name": "A.
