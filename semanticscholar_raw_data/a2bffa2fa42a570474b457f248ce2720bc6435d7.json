Although there are numerous approaches and tools, the integration and deployment of these tools for a particular software development project requires effort. The contribution of this work is a platform for continuous integration that adapts common open source testing software for enterprise development for use with Arduinos. A description of a software development workflow that utilizes the platform is provided as well as its specific application to developing a database library for embedded systems.", "venue": "Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2017-04-01", "journal": {"name": "2017 IEEE 30th Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (CCECE)", "pages": "1-4"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "8435583", "name": "Wade Penson"}, {"authorId": "2057479644", "name": "Eric Huang"}, {"authorId": "18146476", "name": "Dana Klamut"}, {"authorId": "48195846", "name": "Eliana Wardle"}, {"authorId": "145888982", "name": "Graeme Douglas"}, {"authorId": "2508040", "name": "Scott Fazackerley"}, {"authorId": "1793707", "name": "R.
