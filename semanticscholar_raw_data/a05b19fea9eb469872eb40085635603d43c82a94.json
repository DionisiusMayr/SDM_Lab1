To deal with the problem, this paper: 1) analyzes the causes of performance degradation and identifies the key one as the large volume of inter-node data transfer resulted from even data distribution among nodes of different computing capabilities, and 2) proposes ActCap, a solution that uses a Markov chain based model to do node-capability-aware data placement for the continuously incoming data. ActCap has been incorporated into Hadoop and evaluated on a 24-node heterogeneous cluster by 13 benchmarks. The experimental results show that ActCap can reduce the percentage of inter-node data transfer from 32.9% to 7.7% and gain an average speedup of 49.8% when compared with Hadoop, and achieve an average speedup of 9.8% when compared with Tarazu, the latest related work.", "venue": "IEEE Conference on Computer Communications", "year": 2015, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2015-08-24", "journal": {"name": "2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)", "pages": "1328-1336"}, "authors": [{"authorId": null, "name": "Bo Wang"}, {"authorId": "1699531", "name": "Jinlei Jiang"}, {"authorId": "145789924", "name": "Guangwen Yang"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "61cb0123a3e66a79fa69f69e84e11d6ac993bc79", "title": "Forseti: Dynamic chunk-level reshaping for data processing on heterogeneous clusters"}, {"paperId": "e67b3f92f7a7c1eec8d9e46fc6660c6e94590b88", "title": "Early straggler tasks detection by recurrent neural network in a heterogeneous environment"}, {"paperId": "e02ff58265bd297d679011d7acfb7f282988c6aa", "title": "A classification framework for straggler mitigation and management in a heterogeneous Hadoop cluster: A state-of-art survey"}, {"paperId": "2252516adf5b1479e7e133527327e2a682f20b72", "title": "Historical data based approach to mitigate stragglers from the Reduce phase of MapReduce in a heterogeneous Hadoop cluster"}, {"paperId": "05c42b3324f293bc63f5ba6f92e0aa799bb7c644", "title": "RENDA: Resource and Network Aware Data Placement Algorithm for Periodic Workloads in Cloud"}, {"paperId": "d26ae558c5eca69917739908c195c5fe41e54e32", "title": "HTD: heterogeneous throughput-driven task scheduling algorithm in MapReduce"}, {"paperId": "7a71a930bce8866881ee69f9b9100864b3ea96aa", "title": "Swift: Reliable and Low-Latency Data Processing at Cloud Scale"}, {"paperId": "e11f4cb7b503810ab1f4fd8b47d4882642652407", "title": "Historical data based approach for straggler avoidance in a heterogeneous Hadoop cluster"}, {"paperId": "d52d6f193bc568f96a792d471c8a3ea0fd1e5000", "title": "OPS: Optimized Shuffle Management System for Apache Spark"}, {"paperId": "82c5d8593cddf250c13bc9f1ccafa2e242cfbe76", "title": "Novel data\u2010placement scheme for improving the data locality of Hadoop in heterogeneous environments"}, {"paperId": "76ca0a08fd9eeadff3e8bef9a959bce4ea2d8178", "title": "Workload-Aware Scheduling for Data Analytics upon Heterogeneous Storage"}, {"paperId": "6303a4cf0beca7009363239953eaaf5698b574e6", "title": "A Workload-aware Resource Management and Scheduling System for Big Data Analysis"}, {"paperId": "c11d224c3ae7b239a6b1582e9df3b96657a5788f", "title": "DynDL: Scheduling Data-Locality-Aware Tasks with Dynamic Data Transfer Cost for Multicore-Server-Based Big Data Clusters"}, {"paperId": "031bf0766c9e87a3f76833bf98c510bad89660cf", "title": "Energy Efficient Node Rank-Based Routing Algorithm in Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks"}, {"paperId": "233480c312c64a091e43adedc09ca2e16f3add37", "title": "A Heterogeneity-Aware Task Scheduler for Spark"}, {"paperId": "efd35048a43fedf064ea99e69e5ff7339b177522", "title": "LAS: Logical-Block Affinity Scheduling in Big Data Analytics Systems"}, {"paperId": "150e61b277e6c954f273dea558f2d422ca6d1172", "title": "Optimal Code Regeneration with Background Traffic Awareness in Distributed Storage"}, {"paperId": "a8b37f042346d57cce935d5c40eae4660483da0f", "title": "Migration-Based Online CPSCN Big Data Analysis in Data Centers"}, {"paperId": "6f2311b5713eb108e46a0307e8e046f13427692c", "title": "CRED: Cloud Right-Sizing with Execution Deadlines and Data Locality"}, {"paperId": "9954bf1c508bba2b35e35d93d53f353469d3be5a", "title": "Towards location-aware joint job and data assignment in cloud data centers with NVM"}, {"paperId": "56c808acbae8aa02869de984f366db344d300ea0", "title": "Traffic At-a-Glance: Time-Bounded Analytics on Large Visual Traffic Data"}, {"paperId": "89ce57616932e9bf0fcce63a3bae167048f6252a", "title": "On the latency-accuracy tradeoff in approximate MapReduce jobs"}, {"paperId": "870debd8a8a69c948b8fab4237234ecd6573e897", "title": "Traffic at-a-glance: Time-bounded analytics on large visual traffic data"}, {"paperId": "3fc38b50c3ca03dddae5fc283a1de3d9d9d11c05", "title": "Joint scheduling of MapReduce jobs with servers: Performance bounds and experiments"}, {"paperId": "8bdb8eb6a0ed6b6d156bbd518b0474a01afab383", "title": "Task Placement Across Multiple Public Clouds With Deadline Constraints for Smart Factory"}]}
