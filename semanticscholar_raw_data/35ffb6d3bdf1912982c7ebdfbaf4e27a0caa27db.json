Due to the tight connection between people and IoT, now civil and criminal investigations or internal probes must take IoT into account. From the forensic perspective, the IoT environment contains a rich set of artifacts that could benefit investigations, while the forensic investigation in IoT paradigm may have to alter to accommodate characteristics of IoT. Therefore, in this article, we analyze the impact of IoT on digital forensics and systematize the research efforts made by previous researchers from 2010 to 2018. We sketch the landscape of IoT forensics and examine the state of IoT forensics under a 3-D framework. The 3-D framework consists of a temporal dimension, a spatial dimension, and a technical dimension. The temporal dimension walks through the standard digital forensic process while the spatial dimension explores where to identify sources of evidence in IoT environment. These two dimensions attempt to provide principles and guidelines for standardizing digital investigations in the context of IoT. The technical dimension guides a way to the exploration of tools and techniques to ensure the enforcement of digital forensics in the ever-evolving IoT environment. Put together, we present a holistic overview of digital forensics in IoT. We also highlight open issues and outline promising suggestions to inspire future study.", "venue": "IEEE Internet of Things Journal", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"],
