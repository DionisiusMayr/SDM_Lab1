No Regret! Multi-Armed Bandits for Index Tuning of Analytical and HTAP Workloads With Provable Guarantees", "abstract": "Automating physical database design has remained a long-term interest in database research due to substantial performance gains afforded by optimised structures. Despite significant progress, a majority of today's commercial solutions are highly manual, requiring offline invocation by database administrators (DBAs). This status quo is untenable: identifying representative static workloads is no longer realistic; and physical design tools remain susceptible to the query optimiser's cost misestimates. Furthermore, modern application environments like hybrid transactional and analytical processing (HTAP) systems render analytical modelling next to impossible. We propose a self-driving approach to online index selection that does not depend on the DBA and query optimiser, and instead learns the benefits of viable structures through strategic exploration and direct performance observation. We view the problem as one of sequential decision making under uncertainty, specifically within the bandit learning setting. Multi-armed bandits balance exploration and exploitation to provably guarantee average performance that converges to policies that are optimal with perfect hindsight. Our comprehensive empirical evaluation against a state-of-the-art commercial tuning tool demonstrates up to 75% speed-up in analytical processing environments and 59% speed-up in HTAP environments. Lastly, our bandit framework outperforms a Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS)-based database optimiser, providing up to 24% speed-up.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-08-23", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering", "pages": "12855-12872", "volume": "35"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2143683565", "name": "R.
