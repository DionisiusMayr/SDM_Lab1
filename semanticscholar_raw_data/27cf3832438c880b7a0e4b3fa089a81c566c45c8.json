Such a cost model can be then leveraged to devise cost-based optimization solutions that deal with task placement and operator configuration.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-05-26", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2105.12507"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "40473987", "name": "A.
