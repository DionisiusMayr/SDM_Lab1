Whereas traditional FL (tFL) focuses on jointly learning a global model, pFL aims to achieve a balance between the global and personalized objectives of each client in FL settings. To foster the pFL research community, we propose PFLlib, a comprehensive pFL algorithm library with an integrated evaluation platform. In PFLlib, We implement 34 state-of-the-art FL algorithms (including 7 classic tFL algorithms and 27 pFL algorithms) and provide various evaluation environments with three statistically heterogeneous scenarios and 14 datasets. At present, PFLlib has already gained 850 stars and 199 forks on GitHub.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-12-08", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2312.04992"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2268433393", "name": "Jianqing Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2152802788", "name": "Yang Liu"}, {"authorId": "2147311278", "name": "Yang Hua"}, {"authorId": "2144220882", "name": "Hao Wang"}, {"authorId": "2055312951", "name": "Tao Song"}, {"authorId": "50774410", "name": "Zhengui Xue"}, {"authorId": "1840514", "name": "Ruhui Ma"}, {"authorId": "2268482142", "name": "Jian Cao"}], "citations": []}
