It is based on three different artificial intelligence tools, namely the fuzzy Ontologies, the cases based reasoning and the rules based reasoning, which have been integrated in one system. Actually, the proposed system is composed of different modules that are well described in details thereafter. In the end of this paper, a case of study is presented in order to illustrate the efficacy of the developed intelligent system.", "venue": "International Journal of Engineering Research in Africa", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-06-19", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Engineering Research in Africa", "pages": "147 - 171", "volume": "64"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2003301952", "name": "Chaimae Abadi"}, {"authorId": "2920151", "name": "I.
