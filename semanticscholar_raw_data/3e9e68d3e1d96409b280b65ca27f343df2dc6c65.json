Yet many intelligent applications run on AI/ML platforms that optimize for high throughput even at the cost of high tail-latency. Cascade is a new AI/ML hosting platform intended to untangle this puzzle. Innovations include a legacy-friendly storage layer that moves data with minimal copying and a\"fast path\"that collocates data and computation to maximize responsiveness. Our evaluation shows that Cascade reduces latency by orders of magnitude with no loss of throughput.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-11-29", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2311.17329"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2256481601", "name": "Weijia Song"}, {"authorId": "2238047375", "name": "Thiago Garrett"}, {"authorId": "2256403583", "name": "Yuting Yang"}, {"authorId": "2268724187", "name": "Mingzhao Liu"}, {"authorId": "3270701", "name": "E.
