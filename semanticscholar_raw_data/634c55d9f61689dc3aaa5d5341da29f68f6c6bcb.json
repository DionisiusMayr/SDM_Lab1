As a consequence, data are being collected at an unprecedented rate. This poses several challenges, including, for example, regarding the storage and processing of these data. Machine Learning (ML) is also not an exception, in the sense that algorithms must now deal with novel challenges, such as learn from streaming data or deal with concept drift. ML engineers also have a harder task when it comes to selecting the most appropriate model, given the wealth of algorithms and possible configurations that exist nowadays. At the same time, training time is a stronger restriction as the computational complexity of the training model increases. In this paper we propose a framework for dealing with these challenges, based on meta\u2010learning. Specifically, we tackle two well\u2010defined problems: automatic algorithm selection and continuous algorithm updates that do not require the retraining of the whole algorithm to adapt to new data. Results show that the proposed framework can contribute to ameliorate the identified issues.", "venue": "International Journal of Intelligent Systems", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-06-30", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Intelligent Systems", "pages": "6240 - 6272", "volume": "36"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "119868315", "name": "J.
