However, Dragonfly topology suffers from the limited direct links between groups. The reconfigurable network can solve this problem by reconfiguring topology to adjust the number of direct links between groups. While the performance improvement of a single job on reconfigurable HPC network has been evaluated in previous works, the performance of HPC workloads has not been studied because of the lack of an appropriate resource allocation policy. In this work, we propose Group-level Resource Allocation Policy (GRAP) to allocate both compute nodes and Reconfigurable Links for jobs in Reconfigurable Dragonfly Network (RDN). We start with formulating three design principles: reconfigurable network should be reconfiguration interference-free, guarantee connectivity and performance for each job, and satisfy varied resource requests. According to the principles, GRAP uses different strategies for small and large jobs, and contains three allocation modes for large jobs: Balance Mode, Custom Mode, and Adaptive Mode. Finally, we evaluate GRAP with the CODES network simulation framework and the Slurm Simulator using real workload traces. The results demonstrate that RDN coupled with GRAP achieves lower latency, higher bandwidth, and lower job wait time.", "venue": "International Conference on Supercomputing", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-06-21", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 37th International Conference on Supercomputing"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2170490029", "name": "Guangnan Feng"}, {"authorId": "39891717", "name": "Dezun Dong"}, {"authorId": "2110771933", "name": "Shizhen Zhao"}, {"authorId": "2140026613", "name": "Yutong Lu"}], "citations": []}
