Thus, these insights can help companies make quick and informed business decisions. First, we suggest a manual database schema creation technique to reduce the response time of the data analysis process in the context of big data under the Spark platform. Then, in order to distribute the activities to be performed on the Spark slots more evenly, we suggest a data allocation technique. The data is then saved in RAM, using the cache for faster reading. Finally, to solve the problems of loading data into the cache, we suggest using a different file format called \u201dParquet.\u201d We evaluated our strategy using the \u201dfire calls for service\u201d (CFS) data set, which led to a 97.77% faster response time. This demonstrates how the suggested optimization options considerably reduce the time needed to import the cache and read the database.", "venue": "", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2225903446", "name": "Member Iaeng Tarik Hajji"}, {"authorId": "2225902992", "name": "Riad Loukili"}, {"authorId": "3019026", "name": "I.
