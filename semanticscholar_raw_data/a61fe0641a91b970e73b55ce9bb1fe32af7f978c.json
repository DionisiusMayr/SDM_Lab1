As a consequence, the need for dedicated tools to apply continuous learning in streams emerges. This paper presents STREAMER, a flexible, scalable, and cross-platform machine learning experimenter with a realistic operational stream environment and visualization capabilities. Oriented to data scientists, this framework provides a set of machine learning algorithms and an API to easily integrate new ones. In order to illustrate how STREAMER works, we show a demonstration of an unsupervised anomaly detection of electrocardiograms (ECG) tested in a streaming context.", "venue": "International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2020-10-19", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 29th ACM International Conference on Information & Knowledge Management"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2042695301", "name": "Sandra Garc\u00eda-Rodr\u00edguez"}, {"authorId": "2000567082", "name": "Mohammad Alshaer"}, {"authorId": "2268166538", "name": "C.
