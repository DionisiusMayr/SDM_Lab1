In this paper, we target the discovery of tagged unions, a JSON Schema design pattern where the value of one property of an object (the tag) conditionally implies subschemas for sibling properties. We formalize these implications as conditional functional dependencies and capture them using the JSON Schema operators if-then-else. We further motivate our heuristics to avoid overfitting. Experiments with our prototype implementation are promising, and show that this form of tagged unions can successfully be detected in real-world GeoJSON and TopoJSON datasets. In discussing future work, we outline how our approach can be extended further.", "venue": "DEco@VLDB", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-06-12", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2306.07085"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2158368246", "name": "Stefan Klessinger"}, {"authorId": "1685783", "name": "Meike Klettke"}, {"authorId": "1710463", "name": "U.
