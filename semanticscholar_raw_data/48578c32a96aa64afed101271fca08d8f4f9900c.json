A more closely tied term to the Internet of Things is Edge Computing, which describes empowering devices at the edge with intelligence. One characteristic of these edge devices is the improved latency provided against Cloud computing. The network edge is an under-utilized area and by merging intelligence with edge computing devices, we can effectively exploit it with novel approaches. This paper seeks to bring to light several \u201cInternet of Things\u201d devices at the edge and their capability in bringing intelligence to the network edge. A novel approach is introduced by comparing devices concerning the processing capability, memory capacity and applications. It is then clear, that there are many devices today on par with smartphones equally capable of deploying intelligence at the edge.", "venue": "2022 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence of Things (ICAIoT)", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-12-29", "journal": {"name": "2022 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence of Things (ICAIoT)", "pages": "1-6"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2217624266", "name": "Kevin Afachao"}, {"authorId": "1403308610", "name": "A.
