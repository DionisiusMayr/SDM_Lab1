Many folks don't adhere to the legal traffic norms and regulations. This may also contribute to traffic collisions. Most traffic collisions are not done on purpose. Serious mistakes like being drowsy or exhausted might have a negative impact. An Aid System for Driver Safety has been put in place to prevent similar scenarios. This device has the capacity to get better driving comfort and security for drivers. This technique may be quite beneficial to elderly people as well. A human-machine interface was used in the construction of an assistance system for drivers' safety, which helps to increase traffic safety. Accidents which are caused by human errors can also be reduced. Some common safety technologies like wearing seatbelts and airbags are not able to prevent road destructions. An Assistance System for Driver\u2019s Safety also alerts the driver during problems such as drowsiness, colliding objects, etc. This system helps in maintaining the stability of the vehicle under critical situations.", "venue": "2023 4th International Conference for Emerging Technology (INCET)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-05-26", "journal": {"name": "2023 4th International Conference for Emerging Technology (INCET)", "pages": "1-5"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "145216131", "name": "Pooja Patil"}, {"authorId": "2222466482", "name": "Sejal Borkar"}, {"authorId": "2222497563", "name": "Pranita Awari"}, {"authorId": "2222497561", "name": "Cristan Jangul"}], "citations": []}
