However, existing approaches have two major limitations: since the blockchain itself is subject to attacks, including selfish mining, double spending, and distributed denial of service attacks, IoT smart devices are also vulnerable once hackers successfully invade blockchain systems; due to the heterogeneity and resource limitations of IoT devices, the deployment of the existing blockchain systems in the IoT scenario cannot reflect strong adaptability and meet IoT service requirements. In this article, we introduce Spacechain, a secure and high-performance blockchain system with three-dimensional ledger architecture, to enable blockchain open in IoT. Specifically, we first design a three-dimensional architecture with novel data structures to deal with the heterogeneity and scalability of IoT networks. Then, we propose the Three-Dimensional Greedy Heaviest-Observed Sub-Tree (3D-GHOST) consensus mechanism for Spacechain to improve security and network performance. Additionally, we conduct detailed security analysis and extensive experimental verification to demonstrate the performance of Spacechain.", "venue": "IEEE wireless communications", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-06-01", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Wireless Communications", "pages": "38-45", "volume": "27"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "50593492", "name": "Miao Du"}, {"authorId": "144547968", "name": "Kun Wang"}, {"authorId": "1604963638", "name": "Yinqiu Liu"}, {"authorId": "2053225439", "name": "Kai Qian"}, {"authorId": "1759469", "name": "Yanfei Sun"}, {"authorId": "47210234", "name": "Wenyao Xu"}, {"authorId": "144123438", "name": "Song Guo"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "a7a7833b1aae1582a640caac2422de11feba446f", "title": "A Repeated Game-Based Distributed Denial of Service Attacks Mitigation Method for Mining Pools"}, {"paperId": "18ee7ea3756cd081f1d0ff9a4f6c64953cb63bbc", "title": "IoT security with blockchain: A review"}, {"paperId": "2293233745868635ac8eb4a2aea057eeaa5f3627", "title": "GTxChain: A Secure IoT Smart Blockchain Architecture Based on Graph Neural Network"}, {"paperId": "74721f23f71a1cb946ce72476e6927a19679ae96", "title": "AIBPSF-IoMT: Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain-Based Predictive Security Framework for IoMT Technologies"}, {"paperId": "121b11ce09c7e2b74970a4ae0960eddbdf944331", "title": "HPCchain: A Consortium Blockchain System Based on CPU-FPGA Hybrid-PUF for Industrial Internet of Things"}, {"paperId": "b4551b971c1be60b3da7802571edb49bab9d5557", "title": "Blockchain-Based Licensed Spectrum Fair Distribution Method towards 6G-Envisioned Communications"}, {"paperId": "8590dd42932c67f6d9c9bcf195e8779acf585b97", "title": "Harnessing Web3 on Carbon Offset Market for Sustainability: Framework and A Case Study"}, {"paperId": "37847172b7761a610e788b2572e4b89f6fc493cc", "title": "Efficient Byzantine Consensus Algorithm in IoT Scenarios"}, {"paperId": "6726200b2b0f1ac0b503a86b732f1f1472a9a774", "title": "Secure Data Reduplication System with Efficient and Reliable Multi-Key Management in Cloud Storage"}, {"paperId": "01af8073cb86a9eb895de3358436dbeda58fb4dd", "title": "Leveraging Blockchain Technology for Ensuring Security and Privacy Aspects in Internet of Things: A Systematic Literature Review"}, {"paperId": "9c79c2d40d15fe7c55aeec4d9af009a69579472d", "title": "Reputation\u2010based partition scheme for IoT security"}, {"paperId": "1a26d9d0b632efb38fba7ac5cac7bf9619c5d389", "title": "Improving IoT Data Security and Integrity Using Lightweight Blockchain Dynamic Table"}, {"paperId": "6f562151a09ee5dac1d9f26d91ffb77bfddba0c8", "title": "The Combination of Blockchain and Internet of Things -
