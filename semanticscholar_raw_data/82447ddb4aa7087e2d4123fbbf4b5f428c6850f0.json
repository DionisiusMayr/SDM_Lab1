Based on the advancements in data science and Machine Learning (ML), an improved ability to integrate and process the so-called primary and secondary data fosters the provision of real-time and personalized decisions. In that direction, an innovative mechanism for processing and integrating health-related data is introduced in this article. It describes the details of the mechanism and its internal subcomponents and workflows, together with the results from its utilization, validation, and evaluation in a real-world scenario. It also highlights the potential derived from the integration of primary and secondary data into Holistic Health Records (HHRs) and from the utilization of advanced ML-based and Semantic Web techniques to improve the quality, reliability, and interoperability of the examined data. The viability of this approach is evaluated through heterogeneous healthcare datasets pertaining to personalized risk identification and monitoring related to pancreatic cancer. The key outcomes and innovations of this mechanism are the introduction of the HHRs, which facilitate the capturing of all health determinants in a harmonized way, and a holistic data ingestion mechanism for advanced data processing and analysis.", "venue": "Italian National Conference on Sensors", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-03-01", "journal": {"name": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "volume": "24"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2051299593", "name": "George Manias"}, {"authorId": "1403991375", "name": "Ainhoa Azqueta-Alz\u00faaz"}, {"authorId": "2540067", "name": "Athanasios Dalianis"}, {"authorId": "2290701592", "name": "Jacob Griffiths"}, {"authorId": "98179578", "name": "M.
