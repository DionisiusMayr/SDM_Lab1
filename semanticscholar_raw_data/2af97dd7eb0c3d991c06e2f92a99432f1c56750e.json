Nowadays, clusters and hardware accelerators (e.g., GPUs, TPUs) have become a necessity to scale with the data processing demands in many applications related to social media, bioinformatics, surveillance systems, remote sensing, and medical informatics. Given this new scenario, the architecture of data analytics engines must evolve to take advantage of these new technological trends. In this paper, we present ArcaDB: a disaggregated query engine that leverages container technology to place operators at compute nodes that fit their performance profile. In ArcaDB, a query plan is dispatched to worker nodes that have different computing characteristics. Each operator is annotated with the preferred type of compute node for execution, and ArcaDB ensures that the operator gets picked up by the appropriate workers. We have implemented a prototype version of ArcaDB using Java, Python, and Docker containers. We have also completed a preliminary performance study of this prototype, using images and scientific data. This study shows that ArcaDB can speed up query performance by a factor of 3.5x in comparison with a shared-nothing, symmetric arrangement.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-11-25", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2311.14933"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2268398078", "name": "Kristalys Ruiz-Rohena"}, {"authorId": "2268397659", "name": "Manuel Rodriguez-Martinez"}], "citations": []}
