In this paper, we propose a prediction-based spectrum allocation scheme for two-layer cellular vehicular networks, in order to balance resource satisfaction of users in the whole network. Specifically, considering that the number of vehicles in an area is predictable, we introduce a convolutional long short-term memory (Conv_LSTM) network model to predict the number of vehicles within the range of a small base station (SBS). In addition, since the resource demand of the SBS is related to the number of vehicles, we allocate spectrum resources for SBSs based on the prediction result. The spectrum allocation problem is transformed into a multi-coloring (MC) problem and solved by our proposed spectrum allocation algorithm. Numerical results show that our scheme has high accuracy in predicting the number of vehicles and availability in balancing resource satisfaction.", "venue": "International Conference on Innovative Computing and Cloud Computing", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2020-08-09", "journal": {"name": "2020 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)", "pages": "858-863"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2117124905", "name": "Qian Li"}, {"authorId": "66657017", "name": "Weijing Qi"}, {"authorId": "143621714", "name": "Lei Guo"}], "citations": []}
