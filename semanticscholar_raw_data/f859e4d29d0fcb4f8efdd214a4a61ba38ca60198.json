That implies the fault diagnosis for a smart energy system should be of low complexity. In this paper, we propose a Strong Tracking Unscented Kalman Filter ( S T U K F ) and modified Bayes\u2019 classification-based Modified Three Sigma test ( M T S ), abbreviated as S F B T , for smart energy networks. The theoretical analysis and simulations indicate that S F B T detects faults with a high accuracy and a low complexity of O ( n ) .", "venue": "Future Internet", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-02-06", "journal": {"name": "Future Internet", "pages": "26", "volume": "12"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1661045088", "name": "Jiong Wang"}, {"authorId": "2108905623", "name": "Hua Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2116444063", "name": "Dongliang Lin"}, {"authorId": "2113274672", "name": "H.
