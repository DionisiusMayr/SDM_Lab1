Finding hotspots has important applications in many domains including public health, crime analysis, transportation, etc. Existing methods of hotspot detection rely on test statistics (e.g., likelihood ratio, density) that do not consider spatial nondeterminism, leading to false and missing detections. We provide theoretical insights into the limitations of related work, and propose a new framework, namely, Nondeterministic Normalization based scan statistic (NN-scan), to address the issues. We also propose a DynamIc Linear Approximation (DILA) algorithm to improve NN-scan\u2019s efficiency. In experiments, we show that NN-scan can significantly improve the precision and recall of hotspot detection and DILA can greatly reduce the computational cost.", "venue": "SDM", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"pages": "82-90"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "46269169", "name": "Yiqun Xie"}, {"authorId": "145072875", "name": "S.
