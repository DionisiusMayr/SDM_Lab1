Although there have been recent reviews in this field, there is a remarkable gap that addresses four sides of the problem. Namely, the application of video surveillance in smart cities, algorithms, datasets, and embedded systems. In this paper, we discuss the latest datasets used, the algorithms used, and the recent advances in embedded systems to form edge vision computing are introduced. Moreover, future trends and challenges are addressed.", "venue": "Italian National Conference on Sensors", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2021-05-01", "journal": {"name": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "volume": "21"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2093481284", "name": "Mostafa Ahmed Ezzat"}, {"authorId": "113932496", "name": "Mohamed A.
