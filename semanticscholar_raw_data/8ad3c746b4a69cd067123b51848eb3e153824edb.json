However, the \u201cdata isolation\u201d problem largely hinders its full potential. To solve this problem, it is crucial to enable collaborative computing among multiple data sources. Federated computing, a new collaborative computing paradigm that keeps the raw datasets decentralized, has emerged as a hot research topic in both databases and artificial intelligence. This paper introduces the concepts of federated computing, reviews recent topics, which include \u201cfederated queries\u201d and \u201cfederated learning\u201d, and discusses the future trends.", "venue": "IEEE Data Engineering Bulletin", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "IEEE Data Eng.
