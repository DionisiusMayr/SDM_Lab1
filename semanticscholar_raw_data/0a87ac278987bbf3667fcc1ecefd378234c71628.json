The analysis of the acquired microscopy images involves assembling and curating morphological measurements of individual cells into morphological profiles suitable for testing biological hypotheses. Despite being a critical step, there is currently no standard approach to morphological profiling and no solution is available for the high-performance Julia programming language. Results Here, we introduce BioProfiling.jl, an efficient end-to-end solution for compiling and filtering informative morphological profiles in Julia. The package contains all the necessary data structures to curate morphological measurements and helper functions to transform, normalize and visualize profiles. Robust statistical distances and permutation tests enable quantification of the significance of the observed changes despite the high fraction of outliers inherent to high-content screens. This package also simplifies visual artifact diagnostics, thus streamlining a bottleneck of morphological analyses. We showcase the features of the package by analyzing a chemical imaging screen, in which the morphological profiles prove to be informative about the compounds\u2019 mechanisms of action and can be conveniently integrated with the network localization of molecular targets.
