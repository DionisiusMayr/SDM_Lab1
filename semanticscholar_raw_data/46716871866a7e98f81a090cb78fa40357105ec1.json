For us to be able to extract any meaningful information, it is important to achieve real\u2010time online data analytics. Skyline queries are important in many online data applications such as real\u2010time Web mining, multipreference analysis, and decision making. Most existing studies mainly focus on centralized systems, and distributed skyline query processing is still an emerging and challenging topic. In this paper, we propose SkyStorm, a delay\u2010bounded parallel skyline computing approach for large\u2010scale real\u2010time data analytics by dividing the search into multiple rounds and limiting the search in each round within a budget\u2010restricted range. The effectiveness of our proposals is demonstrated through analysis and simulations.", "venue": "Concurrency and Computation", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2017-05-25", "journal": {"name": "Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience", "volume": "29"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2183688839", "name": "Qian Wang"}, {"authorId": "2110964626", "name": "Chao Yu"}, {"authorId": "1908353", "name": "Yiming Zhang"}, {"authorId": "1940437", "name": "Huiba Li"}, {"authorId": "2062707957", "name": "Ping Zhong"}], "citations": []}
