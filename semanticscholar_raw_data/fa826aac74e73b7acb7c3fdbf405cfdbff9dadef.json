Considered as one major form of AI, machine learning (ML) is an application that performs repeated iterations of models progressively improving the performance of a specific task by adapting several methods including random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), longitudinal regression (LR), and elastic net regularized generalized linear model. ML has been used in several clinical studies comprising IBD patients to determine the differential diagnosis of IBD, to assess IBD, and to predict the response and clinical outcomes of medications used to treat IBD. However, ML-assisted diagnostic or predictive measures for the daily medical care of IBD patients has not been applied yet. Here, we briefly reviewed some representative studies and subsequently addressed the challenges and opportunities of AI in the medical care of IBD patients.", "venue": "Chinese Medical Journal", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2020-03-02", "journal": {"name": "Chinese Medical Journal", "pages": "757 - 759", "volume": "133"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2117985961", "name": "Ji Li"}, {"authorId": "2173141381", "name": "J.
