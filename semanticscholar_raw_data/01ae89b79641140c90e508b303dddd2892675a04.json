Analysis of transmission ability of wireless signal in steel ship environment is important for network deployment including base station and node installation, which would directly impact network performance and has become a hot research field. +is paper investigates 2.4GHz frequency wireless signal propagation characteristics in the steel ship cabin. A 3D ray-tracing model of 2.4GHz wave propagation in the ship cabin is established, a multipath propagation prediction is carried on, and receiving power is calculated. Besides, the experimental test is performed in the real ship. +e simulated and experimental results are processed and compared; the influence law of large obstacles on the signal is discussed, and the guidance scheme for node and base station deployment of the wireless sensor network is proposed. +e results show that this analysis could provide valid interpretation of wireless channel propagation characteristics in steel ships.", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "13934011", "name": "Wanli Tu"}, {"authorId": "2146235006", "name": "Hong Xu"}, {"authorId": "2110316821", "name": "Yiqun Xu"}, {"authorId": "152292570", "name": "Q.
