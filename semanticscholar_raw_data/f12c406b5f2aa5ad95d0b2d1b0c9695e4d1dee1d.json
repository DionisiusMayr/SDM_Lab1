In particular, the long transmission distance between the vehicles and the cloud center can cause high latency and poor reliability which may degrade application performance and quality of service. As an integration of mobile edge computing and vehicular networks, vehicular edge computing is a promising paradigm that aims to improve vehicular services by performing computation offloading in close proximity to vehicles. In this paper, the task offloading algorithm that efficiently optimizes task delay and computing resource consumption in multi-user, multi-server vehicular edge computing scenarios is studied. The offloading algorithm not only determines where the tasks are performed, but also indicates the execution order of the tasks on the server. In order to reduce the time complexity, this paper proposes a hybrid intelligent optimization algorithm based on partheno genetic algorithm and heuristic rules. Extensive simulations are conducted, and the results show that compared with the baseline algorithms, the proposed algorithm effectively improves the offloading utility of the VEC system and is suitable for task offloading in various situations.", "venue": "IEEE Access", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-01-10", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Access", "pages": "10466-10477", "volume": "8"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "48480280", "name": "Jianan Sun"}, {"authorId": "2054918822", "name": "Qing Gu"}, {"authorId": "145883894", "name": "T.
