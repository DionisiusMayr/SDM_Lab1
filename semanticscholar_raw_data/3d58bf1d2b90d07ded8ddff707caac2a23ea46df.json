Unfortunately, existing GPM accelerators have not used the best known algorithms and optimizations, and thus offer questionable benefits over software implementations.We present FlexMiner, a software/hardware co-designed GPM accelerator that improves the efficiency without compromising the generality or productivity of state-of-the-art software GPM frameworks. FlexMiner exploits massive amount of coarse-grain parallelism in GPM by deploying a large number of specialized processing elements. For efficient searches, the FlexMiner hardware accepts pattern-specific execution plans, which are generated automatically by the FlexMiner compiler from the given pattern(s). To avoid repetitive computation on neighborhood connectivity, we provide dedicated on-chip storage to memoize reusable connectivity information in a connectivity map (c-map ) which is implemented with low-cost yet high-throughput hardware. The on-chip memories in FlexMiner are managed dynamically using heuristics derived by the compiler, and thus are fully utilized. We have evaluated FlexMiner with 4 GPM applications on a wide range of real-world graphs. Our cycle-accurate simulation shows that FlexMiner with 64 PEs achieves 10.6\u00d7 speedup on average over the state-of-the-art software system executing 20 threads on a 10-core Intel CPU.", "venue": "International Symposium on Computer Architecture", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book"], "publicationDate": "2021-06-01", "journal": {"name": "2021 ACM/IEEE 48th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA)", "pages": "581-594"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2108923360", "name": "Xuhao Chen"}, {"authorId": "8243043", "name": "Tianhao Huang"}, {"authorId": "2326476", "name": "Shuotao Xu"}, {"authorId": "2723048", "name": "Thomas Bourgeat"}, {"authorId": "3261653", "name": "Chanwoo Chung"}, {"authorId": "66319904", "name": "A.
