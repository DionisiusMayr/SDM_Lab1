Location records are replicated close to the object replicas to limit the network traf\ufb01c when requesting an object. We evaluate our approach on the Grid\u20195000 testbed using micro experiments with simple network topologies and a macro experiment using the topology of the French National Research and Education Network (RENATER). In this macro benchmark, we show that the time to locate an object in our approach is less than 15 ms on average which is around 20% shorter than using a traditional Distributed Hash Table (DHT).", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [], "citations": []}
