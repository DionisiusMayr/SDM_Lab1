For LSM, a combination of bagging, dagging, random forest (RF) ensemble with locally weighted learning (LWL), viz. bagging-LWL, dagging-LWL, and RF-LWL has been developed. The 50 landslide areas were divided into two categories training (40) and testing (10). For training datasets, the LWL-Bagging model had the highest AUC value of ROC curve (AUC-0.91), followed by LWL-RF (AUC-0.881), LWL-Dagging (AUC-0.88) and LWL (AUC-0.875). For testing datasets, AUC values of ROC curve of 0.891, 0.876, 0.868, and 0.844 were found for LWL-Bagging, LWL-RF, LWL-Dagging, and LWL, respectively. Based on AUC value, all hybrid machines learning models performed well, but LWL-Bagging model performed as the best fit model. The potential ecosystem loss services were assessed by assessing possible landslide hazards. The research delivers reliable results to influence policy decisions on ecosystem management and landslide-assessment.", "venue": "Geocarto International", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-01-21", "journal": {"name": "Geocarto International", "pages": "10170 - 10198", "volume": "37"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "33931620", "name": "J.
