Cloud computing plays an important role in realizing most IoT applications classi\ufb01ed as massive machine type communication and cyber-physical control applications in vertical domains. To handle the increasing amount of IoT data, it is important to reduce the tra \ufb03 c concentrated in the cloud by distributing the computing and storage resources to the network edge side and to suppress the latency of the IoT applications. In this paper, we \ufb01rst present a recent literature review on fog / edge computing and data aggregation as representative tra \ufb03 c reduction technologies for e \ufb03 ciently utilizing communication, computing, and storage resources in IoT systems, and then focus on data aggregation control minimizing the latency in an IoT gateway. We then present a uni\ufb01ed modeling for statistical and nonstatistical data aggregation and analyze its latency. We analytically derive the Laplace\u2013Stieltjes transform and average of the stationary distribution of the latency and approximate the average latency; we subsequently apply it to an adaptive aggregation number control for the time-variant data arrival. The transient tra \ufb03 c characteristics, that is, the absorption of tra \ufb03 c \ufb02uctuations realizing a stable optimal latency, were clari\ufb01ed through a simulation with a time-variant Poisson input and non-Poisson inputs, such as a Beta input, which is a typical IoT tra \ufb03 c model.", "venue": "IEICE transactions on communications", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "IEICE Transactions on Communications"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "50748194", "name": "H.
