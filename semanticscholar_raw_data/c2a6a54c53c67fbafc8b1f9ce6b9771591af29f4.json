Smart city applications range from technical and social to economic and ecological. The main focus of this work is to provide a systematic literature review of smart city research to answer two main questions: (1) How is current research on smart cities structured? and (2) What directions are relevant for future research on smart cities? To answer these research questions, a text-mining approach is applied to a large number of publications. This provides an overview and gives insights into relevant dimensions of smart city research. Although the main dimensions of research are already described in the literature, an evaluation of the relevance of such dimensions is missing. Findings suggest that the dimensions of environment and governance are popular, while the dimension of economy has received only limited attention.", "venue": "Proceedings of the  International Conferences on ICT, Society and Human Beings (ICT 2020), Connected Smart Cities (CSC 2020) and Web Based Communities and Social Media (WBC 2020)", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2020-07-21", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the  International Conferences on ICT, Society and Human Beings (ICT 2020), Connected Smart Cities (CSC 2020) and Web Based Communities and Social Media (WBC 2020)"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "66406116", "name": "Yusuf Bozkurt"}, {"authorId": "2056203990", "name": "Reiner Braun"}, {"authorId": "39427500", "name": "Alexander Rossmann"}, {"authorId": "2081879493", "name": "D.
