However, directly sharing diagnostic information between institutions is typically not permitted due to the protection of patients\u2019 highly sensitive privacy. As a novel privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm, federated learning (FL) makes it possible to maximize the data utility among multiple medical institutions. These feature-enrichment FL techniques are referred to as vertical FL (VFL). Traditional VFL can only benefit multi-parties\u2019 shared samples, which strongly restricts its application scope. In order to improve the information-sharing capability and innovation of various healthcare-related institutions, and then to establish a next-generation open medical collaboration network, we propose a unified framework for vertical federated knowledge transfer mechanism (VFedTrans) based on a novel cross-hospital representation distillation component. Specifically, our framework includes three steps. First, shared samples\u2019 federated representations are extracted by collaboratively modeling multi-parties\u2019 joint features with current efficient vertical federated representation learning methods. Second, for each hospital, we learn a local-representation-distilled module, which can transfer the knowledge from shared samples\u2019 federated representations to enrich local samples\u2019 representations. Finally, each hospital can leverage local samples\u2019 representations enriched by the distillation module to boost arbitrary downstream machine learning tasks. The experiments on real-life medical datasets verify the knowledge transfer effectiveness of our framework.", "venue": "The Web Conference", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-02-11", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2205736430", "name": "Chung-ju Huang"}, {"authorId": "2143500842", "name": "Leye Wang"}, {"authorId": "2118233331", "name": "Xiao Han"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "f13f014f51dd425661e3202067c5ef5052fe4d6a", "title": "Vertical Federated Learning"}, {"paperId": "5b8188d8167fe01408828df4aa969c48454cfe63", "title": "A Hybrid Self-Supervised Learning Framework for Vertical Federated Learning"}, {"paperId": "1664403b172d2d046996eccdb534abe0a545ab62", "title": "VFedMH: Vertical Federated Learning for Training Multi-party Heterogeneous Models"}]}
