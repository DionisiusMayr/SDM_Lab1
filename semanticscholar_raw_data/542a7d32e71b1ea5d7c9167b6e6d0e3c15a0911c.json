In this paper, we argue that both algorithmic and dynamics/control modelling approaches should be combined and visual analytics should be adopted to gain better understanding of the complex behaviour of vessels and the ocean. We then propose ventilation detection methods which require no a priori information about the subject vessel or the propellers, which enables further development of automatic parameter re\ufb01nement and interactive visual detection and exploration of vessel behaviour as next steps. This work is an important part of our initial efforts towards a visual analytics framework for maritime operations.", "venue": "", "year": null, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2144223245", "name": "Hao Wang"}, {"authorId": "30735990", "name": "Sindre Fossen"}, {"authorId": "2265674886", "name": "Fang Han"}, {"authorId": "2237443059", "name": "Ibrahim A.
