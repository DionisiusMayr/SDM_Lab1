The performance of our clustering algorithm is assessed on a detailed experimental design based on the extended Generalized Pareto distribution. Sensitivity to the number of clusters is carefully analyzed. We apply our clustering algorithm on Switzerland daily precipitation measured at 191 sites. The found homogeneous regions are consistent with local orography and our approach outperforms the classical regional frequency analysis based on normalized elevation and coordinates as covariates. To complete our analysis of Swiss rainfall, we propose three models based on our clustering outputs. A comparison between our local, semi-regional and regional models indicates that a relatively simple model with two clusters and a spatially varying scale parameter can compete very well against complex models.", "venue": "", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "123552862", "name": "P.
