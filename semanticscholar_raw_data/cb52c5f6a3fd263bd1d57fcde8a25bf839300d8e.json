Allocating and managing limited network channel to secondary user (SUs) considering dynamic behavior pattern of primary users (PUs) is a critical issue of CR-WSN. Recently, various channel access methodologies using statistical, reinforcement learning (RL), game theory (GT), and deep learning (DL) model have been presented for CR-WSN. However, the existing channel access methodologies has following two limitations: i) fails to assure balance between maximizing throughput of SUs with minimal interference to PUs considering multi-channel CR-WSNs environment; and ii) maximizing throughput with minimal collision assuring access fairness among SUs considering energy constraint CR-WSNs. In addressing the research issues, this paper present throughput maximization channel access fairness using game theory (TMCAF-GT) model. The TMCAF employ both shared and non-shared channel access mechanism employing GT model for assuring throughput maximization with minimal interference and access fairness. Experiment outcome shows the TMCAF-GT provides superior throughput with minimal collision.", "venue": "Indonesian Journal of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-09-01", "journal": {"name": "Indonesian Journal of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2285527651", "name": "Humera Tauseef"}, {"authorId": "2226350470", "name": "Rukhsar Fatima"}, {"authorId": "69919546", "name": "Rohina Khanam"}], "citations": []}
