This paper presents the first comprehensive study on parallelizing the IaWJ on modern multicore architectures. In particular, we classify IaWJ algorithms into lazy and eager execution approaches. For each approach, there are further design aspects to consider, including different join methods and partitioning schemes, leading to a large design space. Our results show that none of the algorithms always performs the best, and the choice of the most performant algorithm depends on: (i) workload characteristics, (ii) application requirements, and (iii) hardware architectures. Based on the evaluation results, we propose a decision tree that can guide the selection of an appropriate algorithm.", "venue": "SIGMOD Conference", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2021-06-09", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 2021 International Conference on Management of Data"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2188004", "name": "Shuhao Zhang"}, {"authorId": "143824511", "name": "Bingsheng He"}, {"authorId": "2101530688", "name": "Nus"}, {"authorId": "144030168", "name": "Richard T.
