Nowadays, it is possible to collect precise data describing movements of public transport. Speci\ufb01cally, for each bus (or tram) geopo-sition data can be regularly collected. This includes data for all buses in Warsaw, Poland. Moreover, this data can be downloaded and analysed. In this context, one of the simplest questions is: can a model be build to represent behavior of busses, and predict their delays. This work provides initial results of our attempt to answer this question.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-04-09", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2204.04515"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2162044970", "name": "Lukasz Palys"}, {"authorId": "1829313", "name": "M.
