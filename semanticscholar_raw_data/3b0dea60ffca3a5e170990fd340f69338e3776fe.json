Our objective was to examine the types and sources of stigma that people seek support for in online OUD recovery communities (subreddits) on Reddit. Methods: We extracted all posts containing stigma keywords from three subreddits as well as a random sample that do not contain stigma keywords. We conducted deductive content analysis to confirm that the post self-described an experience of stigma and identify the type (condition, intervention) and source (provider-based, public, self, structural) of stigma. Results: Two-hundred and fifty-nine posts self-reported a stigmatizing experience. The majority of posts described an intervention stigma associated with medications for OUD. Posts discussing intervention stigma acknowledged the role of stigma in their treatment decision-making and quality of their treatment program. The most frequent sources of stigma were the public (including family members), provider-based (healthcare and pharmacy workers), structural (workplace, law enforcement, child protective services, and abstinence-based self-help groups), and self. No posts mentioned courtesy stigma. Posts sought assistance in navigating their experiences and participating in advocacy to counter stigmatized narratives. Conclusions: Our study indicates that people in online communities seek support to disclose and manage experiences of stigma on Reddit in similar ways to people in offline communities with the noted exception of an absence of discussions of courtesy stigma. Since each subreddit is a microcosm of varying needs, we suggest areas of future work for collaborative resources developed between stakeholders of these subreddits and public health that work within the preexisting Reddit social norms.", "venue": "Substance Use & Misuse", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-07-09", "journal": {"name": "Substance Use & Misuse", "pages": "1511 - 1522", "volume": "57"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2137452441", "name": "W.
