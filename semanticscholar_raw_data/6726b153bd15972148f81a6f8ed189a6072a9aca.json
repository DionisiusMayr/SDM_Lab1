Continued operation of these service is critical. This article investigates resilience against failures in a smart city. It classifies applications based on their impact of service degradation. It provides an overview of a wide range of faults and failures that could lead to service degradation. It also explores strengths of existing solutions. The paper asserts that requirements of availability vary according to different applications. The paper concludes that for a cost-effective and feasible solution, an adaptive model is needed, which can enable resilience measures as per the needs of an application.", "venue": "IT Professional", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2020-11-01", "journal": {"name": "IT Professional", "pages": "74-81", "volume": "22"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "144392010", "name": "J.
