In this paper we will focus on the structure and the design of this layer, and dig deeper how this layer will translate the user\u2019s inquiring manner to a SQL statement suitable for approximation processing.", "venue": "", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2017-06-20", "journal": {"name": "Oriental journal of computer science and technology", "pages": "271-275", "volume": "10"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3147849", "name": "Tamanna Siddiqui"}, {"authorId": "67173424", "name": "M.
