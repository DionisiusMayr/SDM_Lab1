However, uncertainty remains regarding the optimal way to identify patients with uncontrolled hypertension using electronic health records (EHR). Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we applied computable definitions to EHR to identify patients with controlled and uncontrolled hypertension and to evaluate differences in characteristics, treatment, and clinical outcomes between these patient populations. We included adult patients >=18 years) with hypertension receiving ambulatory care within Yale-New Haven Health System (YNHHS; a large US health system) and OneFlorida Clinical Research Consortium (OneFlorida; a Clinical Research Network comprised of 16 health systems) between October 2015 and December 2018. We identified patients with controlled and uncontrolled hypertension based on either a single blood pressure (BP) measurement from a randomly selected visit or all BP measurements recorded between hypertension identification and the randomly selected visit). Results: Overall, 253,207 and 182,827 adults at YNHHS and OneFlorida were identified as having hypertension. Of these patients, 83.1% at YNHHS and 76.8% at OneFlorida were identified using ICD-10-CM codes, whereas 16.9% and 23.2%, respectively, were identified using elevated BP measurements ({greater than or equal to} 140/90 mmHg). Uncontrolled hypertension was observed among 32.5% and 43.7% of patients at YNHHS and OneFlorida, respectively. Uncontrolled hypertension was disproportionately higher among Black patients when compared with White patients (38.9% versus 31.5% in YNHHS; p<0.001; 49.7% versus 41.2% in OneFlorida; p<0.001). Medication prescription for hypertension management was more common in patients with uncontrolled hypertension when compared with those with controlled hypertension (overall treatment rate: 39.3% versus 37.3% in YNHHS; p=0.04; 42.2% versus 34.8% in OneFlorida; p<0.001). Patients with controlled and uncontrolled hypertension had similar rates of short-term (at 3 and 6 months) and long-term (at 12 and 24 months) clinical outcomes. The two computable definitions generated consistent results. Conclusions: Computable definitions can be successfully applied to health system EHR data to conduct population surveillance for hypertension and identify patients with uncontrolled hypertension who may benefit from additional treatment.", "venue": "medRxiv", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2023-07-28", "journal": {"name": "medRxiv"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1697006", "name": "Yuan Lu"}, {"authorId": "6814871", "name": "E.
