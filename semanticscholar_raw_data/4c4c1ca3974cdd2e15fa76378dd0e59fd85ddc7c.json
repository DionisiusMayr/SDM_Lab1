Big data is pointing to massive, comprehensive, highly correlated complex data forms. At present, most Internet companies use Hadoop's HDFS distributed file system to store data and analyze them using MapReduce. Statistics and analysis mainly use distributed database or distributed computing cluster to analyze and classify the mass data stored in it.
