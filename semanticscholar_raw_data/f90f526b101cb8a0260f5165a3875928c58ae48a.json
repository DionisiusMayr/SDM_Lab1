Matrix profile, the state-of-the-art algorithm to perform time series analysis, computes the most similar subsequence for a given query subsequence within a sliced time series. Matrix profile has low arithmetic intensity, but it typically operates on large amounts of time series data. In current computing systems, this data needs to be moved between the off-chip memory units and the on-chip computation units for performing matrix profile. This causes a major performance bottleneck as data movement is extremely costly in terms of both execution time and energy. In this work, we present NATSA, the first Near-Data Processing accelerator for time series analysis. The key idea is to exploit modern 3D-stacked High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) to enable efficient and fast specialized matrix profile computation near memory, where time series data resides. NATSA provides three key benefits: 1) quickly computing the matrix profile for a wide range of applications by building specialized energy-efficient floating-point arithmetic processing units close to HBM, 2) improving the energy efficiency and execution time by reducing the need for data movement over slow and energy-hungry buses between the computation units and the memory units, and 3) analyzing time series data at scale by exploiting low-latency, high-bandwidth, and energy-efficient memory access provided by HBM. Our experimental evaluation shows that NATSA improves performance by up to 14.2\u00d7 (9.9\u00d7 on average) and reduces energy by up to 27.2 \u00d7 (19.4 \u00d7 on average), over the state-of-the-art multi-core implementation. NATSA also improves performance by 6.3 \u00d7 and reduces energy by 10.2 \u00d7 over a general-purpose NDP platform with 64 in-order cores.", "venue": "ICCD", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2020-10-01", "journal": {"name": "2020 IEEE 38th International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)", "pages": "120-129"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2061067079", "name": "Ivan Fernandez"}, {"authorId": "1939292", "name": "Ricardo Quislant"}, {"authorId": "46175739", "name": "Christina Giannoula"}, {"authorId": "3387282", "name": "M.
