In this paper, a secure DSDL which can grant access to home with a fingerprint is designed and implemented. An Arduino Nano microcontroller board, finger print sensor and servo motor have been utilized for lock/unlock door based on finger print. The DSDL is an automatic authenticate and validate the user for secure access. The implemented system aims to develop a cost\u2212effective DSDL based on low\u2212cost components compared to the systems already on the domestic market. The\u2212ease of\u2212use and cost\u2212effectiveness makes the DSDL a strong competitor to the digital security system on the domestic market and outperforms it and suitable for security\u2013based home automation systems.", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "Indonesian Journal of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science", "pages": "271-277", "volume": "21"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1411311090", "name": "Nael A.
