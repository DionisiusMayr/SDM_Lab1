For example, a soundscape pleasantness study might investigate locations with soundscapes ranging from \u201cpleasant\u201d to \u201cannoying\u201d. The choice of soundscapes is typically researcher led, but a participant-led process can reduce selection bias and improve result reliability. Hence, we propose a robust participant-led method to pinpoint characteristic soundscapes possessing arbitrary perceptual attributes. We validate our method by identifying Singaporean soundscapes spanning the perceptual quadrants generated from the \u201cPleasantness\u201d and \u201cEventfulness\u201d axes of the ISO 12913-2 circumplex model of soundscape perception, as perceived by local experts. From memory and experience, 67 participants first selected locations corresponding to each perceptual quadrant in each major planning region of Singapore. We then performed weighted k-means clustering on the selected locations, with weights for each location derived from previous frequencies and durations spent in each location by each participant. Weights hence acted as proxies for participant confidence. In total, 62 locations were thereby identified as suitable locations with characteristic soundscapes for further research utilizing the ISO 12913-2 perceptual quadrants. Audio\u2013visual recordings and acoustic characterization of the soundscapes will be made in a future study.", "venue": "Sustainability", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Engineering"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-06-07", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2206.03112"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "7343473", "name": "Kenneth Ooi"}, {"authorId": "38143971", "name": "Bhan Lam"}, {"authorId": "10371553", "name": "J.
