Over the last decade, there has been an increasing research concentration in the IoT as an essential design of the constant convergence between human behaviors and their images on Information Technology. With the development of technologies, the IoT drives the deployment of across-the-board and self-organizing wireless networks. The IoT model is progressing toward the notion of a cyber-physical world, where things can be originated, driven, intermixed, and modernized to facilitate the emergence of any feasible association. This paper provides a summary of the existing IoT research that underlines enabling technologies, such as fog computing, wireless sensor networks, data mining, context awareness, real-time analytics, virtual reality, and cellular communications. Also, we present the lessons learned after acquiring a thorough representation of the subject. Thus, by identifying numerous open research challenges, it is presumed to drag more consideration into this novel paradigm.", "venue": "IEEE Access", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "IEEE Access", "pages": "7606-7640", "volume": "7"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "122281435", "name": "Ikram Ud Din"}, {"authorId": "145837053", "name": "M.
