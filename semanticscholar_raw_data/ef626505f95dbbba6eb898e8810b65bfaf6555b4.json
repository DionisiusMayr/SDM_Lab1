It results in a higher incidence of extreme events, such as strong winds, heavy precipitation, floods and droughts. Their consequences have a negative impact not only on the environment, but also on the engineering structures and the safety of the population. In this article, the relationship between the built environment and the effects of climate change is characterised in order to propose systemic changes to improve the adaptation of cities to climate change. Weather- and climate-related hazards for the built environment are analysed, and the possibilities to reduce the risk and mitigate the effect of construction disasters, should they occur. Moreover, a case study conducted in Central Europe has been presented. Based on quantitative data from the Central Office of Building Control in Poland from 2006-2018, the occurrence of construction disasters, their causes and consequences were examined. It was found that the main cause of disasters occurring in Poland during this period were random events (73%), which consisted in particular of extreme weather events such as strong wind or strong wind with accompanying heavy precipitation causing floods and landslides. The highest number of construction disasters (1113) was recorded in 2008, and as many as 95.6% were caused by random events. The conclusion indicates the need to prepare the built environment for climate change and to develop appropriate solutions to reduce the risk of climate-related hazards and to mitigate their effects. Based on the conducted analyses, a conceptual framework of improved climate-resilient built environment management was proposed.", "venue": "IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environment", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Environmental Science", "Physics"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2020-12-16", "journal": {"name": "IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science", "volume": "609"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "95158075", "name": "Zofia Zi\u0119ba"}, {"authorId": "46291126", "name": "J.
