Encryption and steganography are used to ensure that patient medical information is not accessible by unauthorized individuals. This paper presents a literature review for medical image security by encryption and steganography. This literature review discusses twenty-one publications with various applied steganography and encryption of medical image security techniques. This paper provides the research knowledge basis for researchers to have a solid background for their proposed contributions. All approaches are distributed based on two groups the encryption and steganography techniques. The main metrics in this survey to investigate and evaluate model performance was considered PSNR, NPCR, UACI, SSIM, and MSE. When compared to the methods steganography, the results have shown interesting results.", "venue": "2023 Al-Sadiq International Conference on Communication and Information Technology (AICCIT)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-07-04", "journal": {"name": "2023 Al-Sadiq International Conference on Communication and Information Technology (AICCIT)", "pages": "218-223"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2233329753", "name": "Ali Jaber Tayh Albderi"}, {"authorId": "9292960", "name": "L.
