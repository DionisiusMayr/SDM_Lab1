Governments, large corporations and startups have increasingly considered it for storing useful data and obtain valuable business trends. However, there is still a long evolutionary path related to data lake management, where data security is an open issue. In this paper we investigate confidentiality issues in the context of data lakes, with a focus on authentication and authorization. We apply a systematic review methodology focusing on approaches that provide some technology for authentication and authorization management. In the following, we compare the selected studies w.r.t. the used technologies and we also analyze how they are positioned w.r.t. a reference architecture for a data lake management system. This is the first paper that presents such a kind of analysis for data lakes.", "venue": "International Conference on Information Integration and Web-based Applications & Services", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2020-11-30", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on Information Integration and Web-based Applications & Services"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2086515582", "name": "Jo\u00e3o Luiz Monteiro Joaquim"}, {"authorId": "2245614", "name": "R.
