In this context, e-print servers have played a central role by providing scientists with a rapid and open mechanism for disseminating research without having to wait for the (lengthy) peer-review process. While helping the scienti\ufb01c community in several ways, e-print servers also provide scienti\ufb01c communicators and the general public with access to a wealth of knowledge without having to pay hefty subscription fees. Arguably, e-print servers\u2019 value has never been so evident, for better or worse, as during the COVID-19 pandemic. This motivates us to study how e-print servers are positioned within the greater Web, and how they are \u201cused\u201d on Web communities. Using data from Reddit (2005\u20132021) and 4chan\u2019s Politically Incorrect board (2016\u20132021), we uncover a surprisingly diverse set of communities discussing e-print papers. We \ufb01nd that real-world events and distinct factors in\ufb02uence the e-prints people are talking about. For instance, there was a sudden increase in the discussion of e-prints, corresponding to a surge in COVID-19 related research, in the \ufb01rst phase of the pandemic. We \ufb01nd a substantial difference in the conversation around e-prints and their actual content; in fact, e-prints are often being exploited to further conspiracy theories and/or ex-tremist ideology. Overall, our work further highlights the need to quickly and effectively validate non peer-reviewed e-prints that get substantial press/social media coverage, as well as mitigate wrongful interpretations of scienti\ufb01c outputs.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2111.02455"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "9186315", "name": "S.
