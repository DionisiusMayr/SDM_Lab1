Following the standards, by a scalable MPC algorithm, we mean that these algorithms can work on machines that have capacity/memory as small as $n^{\\delta}$ for any positive constant $\\delta<1$. Our results improve over the $O(\\log^2\\log n)$ round algorithms of Behnezhad et al. [PODC'19]. Moreover, our matching algorithm is presumably optimal as its bound matches an $\\Omega(\\log\\log n)$ conditional lower bound of Ghaffari, Kuhn, and Uitto [FOCS'19].", "venue": "International Symposium on Distributed Computing", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2020-02-22", "journal": {"pages": "34:1-34:18"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1772752", "name": "M.
