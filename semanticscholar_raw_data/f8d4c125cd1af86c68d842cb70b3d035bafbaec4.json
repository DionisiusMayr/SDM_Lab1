However, the lack of visibility into user functions limits providers\u2019 ability to right-size the functions. Thus, providers resort to simplifying assumptions, ignoring input variability, and coupling different resource types (CPU, memory, network), resulting in widely varying function performance and resource efficiency. To provide users with predictable performance and costs for their function executions, we need to understand how these factors contribute to function performance and resource usage. In this paper, we first conduct a deep study of commonly deployed serverless functions on an open-source serverless computing framework. Our analysis provides key insights to guide the design of a resource allocation framework for serverless systems, including the need to provision resources per invocation, account for function semantics, and decouple resources. We then present Lachesis , a resource allocation framework that builds on the insights we found and leverages online learning to right-size a function invocation. Our experiments show that Lachesis can increase speedup by 2.6x while decreasing idle cores by 82% compared to static allocation decisions made by users.", "venue": "", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "26033365", "name": "Prasoon Sinha"}, {"authorId": "80189516", "name": "Kostis Kaffes"}, {"authorId": "2397000", "name": "N.
