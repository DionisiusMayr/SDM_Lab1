With the acceleration of the Internet in Web 2.0, Cloud computing as a paradigm to provide dynamic, uncertain and elastic services has shown superiorities to meet the computing needs dynamically. Without an appropriate scheduling approach, extensive Cloud computing may cause high energy consumptions and high cost, in addition that high energy consumption will cause massive carbon dioxide emissions. Moreover, inappropriate scheduling will reduce the service life of physical devices as well as increase response time to users' request. Hence, efficient scheduling of resource or optimal allocation of request, that usually a NP-hard problem, is one of the prominent issues in emerging trends of Cloud computing. Focusing on improving quality of service (QoS), reducing cost and abating contamination, researchers have conducted extensive work on resource scheduling problems of Cloud computing over years. Nevertheless, growing complexity of Cloud computing, that the super-massive distributed system, is limiting the application of scheduling approaches. Machine learning, a utility method to tackle problems in complex scenes, is used to resolve the resource scheduling of Cloud computing as an innovative idea in recent years. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL), a combination of deep learning (DL) and reinforcement learning (RL), is one branch of the machine learning and has a considerable prospect in resource scheduling of Cloud computing. This paper surveys the methods of resource scheduling with focus on DRL-based scheduling approaches in Cloud computing, also reviews the application of DRL as well as discusses challenges and future directions of DRL in scheduling of Cloud computing.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2021-05-10", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2105.04086"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2110809426", "name": "Guangyao Zhou"}, {"authorId": "39720104", "name": "Wenhong Tian"}, {"authorId": "1709598", "name": "R.
