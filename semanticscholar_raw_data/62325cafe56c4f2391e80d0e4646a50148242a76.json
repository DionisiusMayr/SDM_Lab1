Second-line vedolizumab (VED) efficacy may decline following prior infliximab (IFX) treatment failure in UC patients. However, it is not known whether second-line IFX efficacy declines after failure of first-line VED. Aims: We aimed to compare first-line and second-line persistence of IFX and VED, in particular whether second-line IFX persistence declines after failure of first-line VED. Methods: Persistence of IFX and VED was analysed from the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme registry data as either first- or second-line treatment in UC. Propensity score matching (1:1) was conducted in the comparison of first-line treatments. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to identify significant predictors and expressed as a hazard ratio (HR and 95% CI). Results: There were 420 subjects with moderate-to-severe UC who received either first-line IFX (n\u2009=\u2009251) or VED (n\u2009=\u2009169), with 774 patient-years of follow-up. First-line VED had significantly longer persistence than first-line IFX (>50.2 versus 22.2\u2009months, p\u2009=\u20090.001). Fifty-three subjects failed first-line IFX and swapped to second-line VED (IFX\u2192VED group). Twenty-two subjects failed first-line VED group and swapped to second-line IFX (VED\u2192IFX group). First-line VED persistence was significantly longer than second-line VED (>50.2 versus 32.0\u2009months, p\u2009=\u20090.03), but first-line IFX persistence was not statistically significantly different to second-line IFX (27.6\u2009months versus \u2009>\u200938.6\u2009months, p\u2009=\u20090.30). Immunomodulator co-therapy was significantly associated with a lower risk of nonpersistence of first-line VED (HR: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.33\u20130.89, p\u2009=\u20090.02) and IFX (HR: 0.63,95%CI: 0.33\u20130.92, p\u2009=\u20090.02). Conclusion: VED had a significantly longer persistence than IFX as first-line biological agent but does not disadvantage second-line IFX use in moderate-to-severe UC. VED after IFX is associated with significantly poorer persistence. VED, therefore, should be considered as the first-line biological agent of choice in UC.", "venue": "Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-01-01", "journal": {"name": "Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology", "volume": "15"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "73198062", "name": "A.
