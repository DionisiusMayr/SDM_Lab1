This study aimed to discover the behavioural patterns of university instructors regarding the use of an LMS by using sequential and clustering analysis techniques. The usage behaviours of 268 teachers at a public university in China were extracted from the Blackboard platform over the course of one-semester. These behaviours were classified according to five different LMS behavioural types: (1) course and content; (2) assignment; (3) communication and collaboration; (4) assessment; and (5) administration. The results indicated that the most frequent teachers\u2019 LMS usage behaviour was course and content followed by assessment and administration. The results of the sequential analysis indicated that most of the instructors are used to adopting communication and collaboration and assignment when they finish using course and content. In addition, three distinct usage behavioural pattern subgroups were named as teachers preferred assessment, teachers of regular use, and teachers of less use. Implications of these findings are discussed in the light of the university teachers\u2019 behavioural patterns toward using the LMS.", "venue": "International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning (iJET)", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Psychology"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-07-28", "journal": {"name": "Int.
