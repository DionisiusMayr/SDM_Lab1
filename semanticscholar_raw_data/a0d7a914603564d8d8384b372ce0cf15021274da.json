With the rapid advances in ICT, various diabetes information systems have evolved in the past years. The availability of new technologies for diagnosing, monitoring and treating diabetes is critical to achieve recommended metabolic control. Additionally, Big Data solutions are necessary to meet the massive transformation currently occurring in the healthcare industry. The paper highlights the current status of diabetes in Mauritius. Additionally it analyses some existing solutions for diabetes management. The paper also discusses the challenges of Big Data in healthcare and proposes a Big Data framework for diabetes mellitus in Mauritius.", "venue": "IEEE Conference on Computer Communications", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2017-12-01", "journal": {"name": "", "volume": ""}, "authors": [{"authorId": "122160946", "name": "Ravesh Joaheer"}, {"authorId": "2281390", "name": "S.
