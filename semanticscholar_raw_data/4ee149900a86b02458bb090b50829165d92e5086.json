Initially, the data's are taken from CICDDoS 2019 and CICIDS 2018 benchmark datasets. Software defined network (SDN) secure defense system is detected the intrusion and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks on central controllers using multidimensional internet protocol (IP) flow analysis. Here, the enhanced Elman spike neural network (EESNN) classifies DDoS and intrusion attacks as normal and anomaly. The proposed EESNN\u2010IAD\u2010SDN method is executed in python language. The performance metrics, such as accuracy, specificity, F\u2010measure, sensitivity, precision, recall is examined. The proposed EESNN\u2010IAD\u2010SDN method provides 13.93%, 13.26%, 14.35, and 13.73% higher accuracy in CICDDoS 2019 dataset compared with the existing methods, like GRU\u2010IAD\u2010SDN, LSTM\u2010IAD\u2010SDN, and GAN\u2010IAD\u2010SDN, respectively.", "venue": "Concurrency and Computation", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-11-22", "journal": {"name": "Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience", "volume": "35"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "11164115", "name": "Ravi Kiran Varma Penmatsa"}, {"authorId": "2203975914", "name": "R.
