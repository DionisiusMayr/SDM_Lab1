Utilizing advanced analytical methodologies, including wavelet coherence analysis and phase difference, hidden relationships and patterns within social data were revealed. These techniques furnish an enriched comprehension of social phenomena dynamics, bolstering decision-making processes. The study\u2019s versatility extends across myriad domains, offering insights into public sentiment and the foresight for strategic approaches. The findings suggest immense potential in Social Intelligence Mining to influence strategies, foster innovation, and add value across diverse sectors.", "venue": "Big Data and Cognitive Computing", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-11-07", "journal": {"name": "Big Data Cogn.
