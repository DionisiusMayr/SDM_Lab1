Most existing methods have two main issues. First, massive storage redundancy often occurs to materialize semi-join results, but only a part is frequently accessed in most queries. Second, the queries are allocated to the whole cluster, causing a considerable duplication on intermediate results and hence increasing the communication cost. In this paper, we propose a new approach named FP-ExtVP, using a hybrid partitioning schema to reduce the storage requirement without damaging the query performance. In addition, we create an index named P-tree to allocate the queries only to the mentioned nodes, instead of the whole cluster, in order to reduce the shuffle cost. The experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate that, comparing to the native S2RDF, our method outperforms on Star, Snowflake and Complex queries, by reducing nearly a half of the storage requirements.", "venue": "2020 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2020-12-10", "journal": {"name": "2020 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "pages": "543-550"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "38158294", "name": "Jiamin Lu"}, {"authorId": "2149303379", "name": "Cheng Yang"}, {"authorId": "2155840544", "name": "Bingfa Wang"}, {"authorId": "2117000893", "name": "Jun Feng"}], "citations": []}
