This research infrastructure was launched officially on 1 October 2016, funded by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. With the support of ELKH, the infrastructure\u2019s capacity has been substantially boosted; the features and workflows that it offers to scientists were significantly expanded to celebrate the arrival of the year 2022. The article reviews the types of work Hungarian researchers implemented on the infrastructure, thereby providing an overview of the state of cloud-computing enabled science in Hungary.", "venue": "Inform\u00e1ci\u00f3s T\u00e1rsadalom", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-08-31", "journal": {"name": "Inform\u00e1ci\u00f3s T\u00e1rsadalom"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3086415", "name": "Mih\u00e1ly H\u00e9der"}, {"authorId": "3469258", "name": "Erno Rig\u00f3"}, {"authorId": "2185904385", "name": "Dorottya Medgyesi"}, {"authorId": "144752083", "name": "R.
