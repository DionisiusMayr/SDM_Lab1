Several activities performed on cloud computing and checking for those functionality software testing are used. Cloud computing also provides a facility for the development of more powerful and scalable software testing technologies. This paper gives an overview of cloud services and tools (SOASTA and ITKO LISA) with respect to software testing.", "venue": "2018 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communication Control and Networking (ICACCCN)", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2018-10-01", "journal": {"name": "2018 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communication Control and Networking (ICACCCN)", "pages": "414-419"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3399971", "name": "R.
