This is a new branched transport version of optimal quantization problems. New difficulties arise, since in classical semi-discrete optimal transport with Wasserstein distance, the interfaces between cells associated with neighboring atoms have Vorono\\\"i structure and satisfy an explicit description. This description is missing for our problem, in which the cell interfaces are thought to have fractal boundary. We study the asymptotic behaviour of optimal quantizers for absolutely continuous measures as the number $N$ of atoms grows to infinity. We compute the limit distribution of the corresponding point clouds and show in particular a branched transport version of Zador's theorem. Moreover, we establish uniformity bounds of optimal quantizers in terms of separation distance and covering radius of the atoms, when the measure is $d$-Ahlfors regular. A crucial technical tool is the uniform in $N$ H\\\"older regularity of the landscape function, a branched transport analog to Kantorovich potentials in classical optimal transport.", "venue": "", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Mathematics"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2023-09-15", "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "102816966", "name": "Paul Pegon"}, {"authorId": "88725832", "name": "Mircea Petrache"}], "citations": []}
