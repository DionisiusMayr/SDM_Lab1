This is especially true for a smart university, which must integrate and consolidate service coverage to support both basic and smart criteria. To ensure the functional accuracy of this architecture, the experience life cycle model should be thoroughly explored and developed from various perspectives. In this article, we will present the \u201chardware\u201d, \u201csoftware\u201d, \u201cbusiness\u201d, and \u201cresponsiveness & interaction\u201d life cycle categories of our proposed comprehensive smart-university architecture [1]. These categories consider the experiences within the mentioned layers of architecture, providing coverage and support for the total criteria in universities. It is important to note that so as to prioritizing \u201cQuality of Service (QoS)\u201d and \u201cQuality of Experience (QoE)\u201d for smart-university services, both proposed unified software development life cycle and justified methodology are discussed.", "venue": "CSI International Symposium on Artificial Intelligence and Signal Processing", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2024-02-21", "journal": {"name": "2024 20th CSI International Symposium on Artificial Intelligence and Signal Processing (AISP)", "pages": "1-9"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2215405407", "name": "Amir Saberi Varzaneh"}, {"authorId": "2215412386", "name": "Marzieh Saberi Varzaneh"}], "citations": []}
