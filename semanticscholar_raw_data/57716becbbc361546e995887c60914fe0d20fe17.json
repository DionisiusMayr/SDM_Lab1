Different from the traditional DBSCAN algorithm, we introduce a square grid array with side length \u03b5. The whole study area is divided twice into several grids to study the computation. In this algorithm, any data point only needs to make a distance operation with the data points in the range of four different 3*3 grids that it may be in. This significantly reduces the computational complexity and required runtime of the algorithm. In addition, the two different center positions of the grid partition ensure the transitivity of the clustering algorithm and reduce the possibility of data points being misclassified. The simulation results indicate that the Grid-DBSCAN algorithm can effectively handle various clustering conditions. Both the computational time and clustering performance are superior to those of traditional DBSCAN and K-means algorithms.", "venue": "Other Conferences", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-08-10", "journal": {"pages": "127591L - 127591L-6", "volume": "12759"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "120125782", "name": "P.
