It is being considered as the most vital mechanism in the production systems lifecycle. It is the key element in the digital transformation of manufacturing industry all over the world. This scenario imposes a set of major unprecedented challenges which require to be overcome. In order to enable integration in horizontal, vertical, and end-to-end formats, one of the most critical aspects of this digital transformation process consists of effectively coupling digital integrated service/products business models with additive manufacturing processes. This integration is based upon advanced AI-based tools for decentralized decision-making and for secure and trusted data sharing in the global value. This paper presents the FASTEN IIoT Platform, which targets to provide a flexible, configurable, and open solution. The platform acts as an interface between the shop floor and the industry 4.0 advanced applications and solutions. Examples of these efforts comprise management, forecasting, optimization, and simulation, by harmonizing the heterogeneous characteristics of the data sources involved while meeting real-time requirements.", "venue": "Italian National Conference on Sensors", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-09-25", "journal": {"name": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "volume": "20"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "145748016", "name": "F.
