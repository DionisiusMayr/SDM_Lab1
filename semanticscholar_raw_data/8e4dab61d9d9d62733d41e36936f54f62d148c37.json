Even so, implementing CD is difficult to do correctly. This study evaluates how a company adopts and implements the CD principle, the challenges during implementation, and its impact on a company represented as PT XYZ. PT XYZ is a tech company that has adopted CD for several months as an essential principle of the company\u2019s development. We conducted a case study on PT XYZ through observation, interviews, and documentation review, which was then analyzed using thematic analysis and descriptive statistical analysis based on data collected by the company. The results showed that PT XYZ implemented several points of CD technical capability well. However, PT XYZ faced several challenges when transforming its development process using the CD principle: no clear CD implementation framework defined by practitioners, the lack of measurement, and the need to balance the application of CD capabilities. Nevertheless, the application of the CD principle shows a positive impact on PT XYZ psychologically for the IT team and affects the organization's performance.", "venue": "", "year": null, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2260671457", "name": "Lewis"}, {"authorId": "1392769745", "name": "Riyanto Jayadi"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "3003f7438b7b3981de6f8185fc2e63ca352cdff0", "title": "DevOps Implementation Challenges in the Indonesian Public Health Organization"}]}
