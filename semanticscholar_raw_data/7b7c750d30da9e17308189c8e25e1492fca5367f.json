For processing and analysis of this, appropriate techniques are required known as big data analytics. Big data approach with innovative efforts has the capability to analyze, process, and store the various formats of data in parallel mode. It is prediction based techniques for future use, by whom one can improve upon and generate an excellent higher education environment. This paper presents methods of indexing and ranking of an individual faculty member where the score is derived from big-data and later convert into the index and thereafter into ranks. Authors have suggested index formulae who are used to measure excellence existing in higher education system.", "venue": "", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2018-04-18", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Computer Applications", "pages": "8-22", "volume": "180"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2058003111", "name": "D.
