Current log analysis tools ignore the semantic knowledge that is key to workflow construction and analysis. In addition, they focus on infrastructure-level distributed systems. Because of fundamental differences in log features, they are ineffective in distributed data analytics systems. This paper proposes IntelLog, a semantic-aware non-intrusive workflow reconstruction tool for distributed data analytics systems. It is capable of building hierarchical relationships between components and events from logs generated by the targeted systems with little or even no domain knowledge. Leveraging natural language processing, IntelLog automatically extracts and formats semantic information in each log message, including system events, identifiers, locality information, and metrics values. It builds a graph to represent the hierarchical relationship of components in the targeted system via nomenclature conventions. We implement IntelLog for Hadoop MapReduce, Spark and Tez. Evaluation results show that IntelLog provides a fine-grained view of the system workflows with semantics. It outperforms existing tools in automatically detecting anomalies caused by real-world problems, misconfigurations and system bugs. Users can query the formatted semantic knowledge to understand and further troubleshoot the systems.", "venue": "IEEE International Symposium on High-Performance Parallel Distributed Computing", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2019-06-17", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 28th International Symposium on High-Performance Parallel and Distributed Computing"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "40377061", "name": "Aidi Pi"}, {"authorId": null, "name": "Wei Chen"}, {"authorId": "1891284", "name": "Shaoqi Wang"}, {"authorId": "46224002", "name": "Xiaobo Zhou"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "c0ec3daa6dde2885ffadb2953a98e98facef974e", "title": "Development of a Visualization for Developers of a Distributed System Including Idle Computers"}, {"paperId": "c9580b625e8d30a1f9e9f48b5785469c1d8eaa8b", "title": "LogSummary: Unstructured Log Summarization for Software Systems"}, {"paperId": "b3363328cc9289b905863e003934ae87cf0e23ad", "title": "SwissLog: Robust Anomaly Detection and Localization for Interleaved Unstructured Logs"}, {"paperId": "60e5de99b774fbda6822122dcd87dabb6fe0e216", "title": "ADAL-NN: Anomaly Detection and Localization Using Deep Relational Learning in Distributed Systems"}, {"paperId": "c4ffa3b36e0e0e3077037e6504b60a3ad04c49a9", "title": "WRS: Workflow Retrieval System for Cloud Automatic Remediation"}, {"paperId": "729fb4ff4bb0b4eb2be19aaf189dfd1781a03434", "title": "Summarizing Unstructured Logs in Online Services"}, {"paperId": "a2b7d4c790e27c90c79e5e905b2ffdbd400b97bc", "title": "Visualizing Distributed System Executions"}, {"paperId": "94c25a510e325bc3d9c54bded9deeb9242e423a0", "title": "Troubleshooting distributed data analytics systems"}]}
