The purpose of this research is to review the literature from the perspective of agility in Industry 4.0. This paper systematically reviews 381 relevant articles from peer-reviewed academic journals in the period of the last five years. The results show that agility is important for an organization to adopt Industry 4.0 technologies as it helps companies to cope with the changes that arise along with the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies. Further, it also indicates that by adopting Industry 4.0 technologies, companies can significantly enhance their agility capability into various aspects with different technologies. The technologies which enhance the agility are: smart manufacturing, internet of things, cyber-physical system, big data and analytics and cloud computing. On the other hand, important aspects of agility include supply chain, workforce, information system, facilities, management, manufacturing and technology agility.", "venue": "Sustainability", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2021-07-23", "journal": {"name": "Sustainability"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2962287", "name": "B.
