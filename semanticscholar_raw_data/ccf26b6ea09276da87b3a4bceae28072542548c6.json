The column-oriented NoSQL (Not Only SQL) database provide for big data the most suitable model to the data warehouse and the structure of multidimensional data in OLAP cube form. However, in the absence of OLAP cube computation operators, we propose in this paper, a new aggregation operator called CN-CUBE (Columnar NoSQL CUBE), which allows data cubes to be computed from data warehouses stored in column-oriented NoSQL database management system. We implemented the CNCUBE operator using the SQL Phoenix interface of HBase DBMS and conducted experiments on a public data warehouse in a distributed environment produced using the Hadoop platform. Thus we have shown that our CN-CUBE operator has OLAP cubes computation times very suitable for NoSQL warehouses.", "venue": "IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics", "year": 2014, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2014-10-01", "journal": {"name": "2014 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)", "pages": "3828-3833"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3011911", "name": "Khaled Dehdouh"}, {"authorId": "1739726", "name": "F.
