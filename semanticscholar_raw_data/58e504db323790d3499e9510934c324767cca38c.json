Hadoop runs very good with large file of big data, but when it comes to big data in small files it could facing some problems in performance, processing slow down, data access delay, high latency and up to a completely cluster shutting down [2]. In this paper we will high light on one of hadoop\u2019s limitations, that\u2019s affects the data processing performance, one of these limits called \u201cbig data in small files\u201d accrued when a massive number of small files pushed into a hadoop cluster which will rides the cluster to shut down totally. This paper also high light on some native and proposed solutions for big data in small files, how do they work to reduce the negative effects on hadoop cluster, and add extra performance on storing and accessing mechanism.", "venue": "International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering (IJECE)", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2020-04-01", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering (IJECE)"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "145301387", "name": "M.
