However, the deed of instrumenting a work\ufb02ow engine to capture and query provenance data is burdensome. The task may require adding hooks to the work\ufb02ow engine, which can lead to perturbation in execution. An alternative approach is intelligent logging and a careful analysis of logs to extract critical information about work\ufb02ows. However, rapid growth in the size of the log and the cloud-based multi-tenant nature of the engines has made this solution increasingly inef\ufb01cient. We have proposed ProvAnalyser, an ontology-based approach to capture the provenance of work\ufb02ows from event logs. Our approach reduces provenance use cases to SPARQL queries over captured provenance and is capable of reconstructing complete data and invocation dependency graphs for a work\ufb02ow run. The queries can be performed on nested work\ufb02ow executions and can return information generated from one or various executions.", "venue": "International Conference on Model-Driven Engineering and Software Development", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"pages": "105-115"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2289976", "name": "Anila Sahar Butt"}, {"authorId": "143785639", "name": "N.
