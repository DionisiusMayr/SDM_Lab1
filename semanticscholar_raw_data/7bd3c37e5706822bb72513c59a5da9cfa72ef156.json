This paper proposes an information-centric dissemination scheme (ICDS) for smart healthcare services in smart cities. The proposed scheme addresses the time sensitiveness of healthcare data and aims to ensure consistent dissemination. The ICDS uses decision-tree learning to classify requests based on time-sensitive features, allowing prioritization of access. The scheme also involves segregating sensitive information and distributing digital health data within the classified time to retain time sensitiveness and prioritize access. The learning is then modified for the leaves based on data significance and minimum resources to reduce waiting times and improve availability.", "venue": "Sustainability", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2023-03-20", "journal": {"name": "Sustainability"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2241810", "name": "V.
