Our approach automatically minimizes user access rights based on the analysis of SQL query logs and thereby enables a parsimonious data processing. A minimization of data collection is reached by automatic detection and manual deletion of data belonging to unneeded schema elements. In contrast to existing approaches, the DataEconomist supports privacy officers by focusing on the queries instead of making them trawl through a vast amount of collected personal data and specify legal use cases for their processing. SQL queries easily showwho has processed when which data for which purpose and make it easy for the privacy officers to decide about the queries\u2019 compliance with data privacy regulations. Our framework does not require any knowledge of SQL by providing a graphical tool for searching and filtering queries and visualizations of query result sets.", "venue": "International Conference on Extending Database Technology", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"pages": "614-617"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2697151", "name": "Peter K.
