Technologies like the internet and mobile technologies have changed the marketing strategy of the sector. It has been observed that business operators and the workforce employed in the tourism industry do not have sufficient knowledge, tools and/or strategy to implement technology correctly. Technology can be used in all the dimensions of tourism for gaining a competitive edge and providing a wide range of services to customers. For better customer satisfaction, the industry should know the major issues confronting tourism. Experiences shared by tourists on social media, i.e. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube, can be used and analyzed to gain insight on customer needs.
