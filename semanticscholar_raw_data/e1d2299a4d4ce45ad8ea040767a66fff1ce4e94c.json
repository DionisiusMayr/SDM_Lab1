As a crucial signal processing step, microwave filter removes unwanted frequency components away from the received signal and enhances the useful ones. However, large loss, bulky size, and single-band greatly limit the practical applications in urban computing. Therefore, the filters with dual-band characteristic are highly desirable for modern wireless communication, such as device-to-device communication, environment monitoring, and automatic driving. In this paper, a dual-band microwave filter is designed and fabricated based on the theory of Mie-resonance extraordinary transmission. An electromagnetic wave cannot propagate through a subwavelength aperture drilled in a metallic film. By adding two dielectric cuboids of different sizes into the two apertures, two passbands appear in the frequency range of 10.0\u201312.0 GHz. In this range, the insertion loss is less than 0.4 dB, and 3-dB bandwidth is more than 48 MHz. Particularly, the two passband frequencies can be tuned by adjusting the size of the dielectric cuboids. This approach opens a way for designing tunable dual-band microwave bandpass filter, which is benefit for enhancing spectrum resource utilization.", "venue": "IEEE Access", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2019-08-07", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Access", "pages": "98786-98791", "volume": "7"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "49394415", "name": "Jianchun Xu"}, {"authorId": "144459209", "name": "K.
