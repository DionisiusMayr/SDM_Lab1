The issue of uncovering interaction relations in such systems using observable dynamics is called relational inference. In this study, we propose a Diffusion model for Relational Inference (DiffRI), inspired by a self-supervised method for probabilistic time series imputation. DiffRI learns to infer the probability of the presence of connections between components through conditional diffusion modeling. Experiments on both simulated and quasi-real datasets show that DiffRI is highly competent compared with other state-of-the-art models in discovering ground truth interactions in an unsupervised manner. Our code will be made public soon.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-01-30", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2401.16755"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2282145812", "name": "Shuhan Zheng"}, {"authorId": "2118273915", "name": "Ziqiang Li"}, {"authorId": "2268396682", "name": "Kantaro Fujiwara"}, {"authorId": "2268395848", "name": "Gouhei Tanaka"}], "citations": []}
