Clustering plays a significant role in the reference composition of data analysis. Clustering, recognized as an essential issue of unsupervised learning, deals with the segmentation of the data structure in an unknown region and is the basis for further understanding. Among many clustering algorithms, \u201cmore than 100 clustering algorithms known\u201d because of its simplicity and rapid convergence, the K-means clustering algorithm is commonly used. This paper explains the different applications, literature, challenges, methodologies, considerations of clustering methods, and related key objectives to implement clustering with big data. Also, presents one of the most common clustering technique for identification of data patterns by performing an analysis of sample data.", "venue": "International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "47343655", "name": "M.
