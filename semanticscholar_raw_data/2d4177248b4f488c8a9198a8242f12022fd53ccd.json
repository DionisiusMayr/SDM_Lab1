First, the theoretical knowledge of painting image recognition and painting style transfer is discussed. Then, lightweight deep learning techniques and their application principles are introduced. Finally, faster convolutional neural network (Faster-CNN) image feature recognition and style transfer models are designed based on a lightweight deep learning model. The model performance is comprehensively evaluated. The research results show that the designed Faster-CNN model has the highest average recognition efficiency of about 28\u2009ms and the lowest of 17.5\u2009ms in terms of feature recognition of painting images. The accuracy of the Faster-CNN model for image feature recognition is about 97% at the highest and 95% at the lowest. Finally, the designed Faster-CNN model can perform style recognition transfer on a variety of painting images. In terms of style recognition transfer efficiency, the highest recognition transfer rate of the designed Faster-CNN model is about 79%, and the lowest is about 77%. This work not only provides an important technical reference for feature recognition and style transfer of painting images but also contributes to the development of lightweight deep learning techniques.", "venue": "Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-07-05", "journal": {"name": "Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience", "volume": "2022"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2115943155", "name": "Y.
