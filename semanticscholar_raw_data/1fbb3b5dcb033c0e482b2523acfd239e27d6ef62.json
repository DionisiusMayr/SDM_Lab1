Thus, we conducted 30 interviews among Brazilian businesses. Results confirmed the existence of an alignment among the perspectives of the characteristics, benefits and adoption factors for smart contracts. Also, it was possible to conclude that the practice of smart contracts is still incipient in Brazil, and the prospects for applying them in companies have been spurred by the health restrictions put in place by the combat against COVID-19.", "venue": "Revista Pensamento Contempor\u00e2neo em Administra\u00e7\u00e3o", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-12-19", "journal": {"name": "Revista Pensamento Contempor\u00e2neo em Administra\u00e7\u00e3o"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2222204018", "name": "Alan Moreira Lopes"}, {"authorId": "2064800665", "name": "Jurandir Peinado"}, {"authorId": "133985058", "name": "F.
