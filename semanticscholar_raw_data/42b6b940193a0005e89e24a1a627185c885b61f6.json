As the global economy continues to decline, enterprises pay more attention to refined operations and cost reduction and efficiency enhancement than before, and cloud computing is no exception. Does cloud computing ultimately increase the cost of business or is it worth the money? In the situation of business homogeneity competition, the cost, investment and operation of cloud infrastructure have also become the key to affecting the market competitiveness of enterprise cloud business. To achieve these issues, we design the platform named SmartCMP, which provides the value of cloud cost analysis and optimization. Firstly, from the perspective of financial, multi-dimensional display and analysis of cloud costs are carried out to find ways to reduce costs. Then, users can customize strategies for daily operation, speed up decision-making and reduce risks. Lastly, our platform will actively monitor, detect and repair risks in real time in accordance with policies to strengthen security. The effectiveness of our platform can be verified by comparing to other strategies.", "venue": "International Conference on Smart Cloud", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-10-01", "journal": {"name": "2022 IEEE 7th International Conference on Smart Cloud (SmartCloud)", "pages": "171-176"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2146331154", "name": "Fang Li"}, {"authorId": "2190835796", "name": "Gang Wu"}, {"authorId": "2152962871", "name": "Jianhua Lu"}, {"authorId": "2190879255", "name": "Mingye Jin"}, {"authorId": "2190867993", "name": "Haitao An"}, {"authorId": "2144488984", "name": "Junxiong Lin"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "8f53954f40644cf6901e9bfab991e072610ce242", "title": "FinOps in Cloud-Native Near Real-Time Serverless Streaming Solutions"}]}
