Seven models, trained on a reduced feature inSDN dataset, aim to detect malicious SDN traffic. Testing involves diverse traffic types generated with Pyshark and CICFlowMeter. The study achieves its goals by creating effective intrusion detection models, developing new test datasets, implementing the pipeline, and validating it through testing in the real-time practical network in the cybersecurity lab. The use of double-feature selection is pivotal. Overall, this research accelerates the deployment of supervised machine learning in intrusion detection, strengthening cybersecurity against evolving threats.", "venue": "Ubiquitous Computing, Electronics & Mobile Communication Conference", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-10-12", "journal": {"name": "2023 IEEE 14th Annual Ubiquitous Computing, Electronics & Mobile Communication Conference (UEMCON)", "pages": "0495-0501"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2267046881", "name": "Ethan Berei"}, {"authorId": "2267047361", "name": "Ahmed Oun"}, {"authorId": "153229421", "name": "M.
