This paper presents a review on smart grids and big data. In order to achieve this, available articles in the literature were reviewed in perception with the features of big data and smart grids. Potential issues for smart grids and big data analytics were discussed. The recent solutions and challenges in smart grids and big data analytics were presented. The technologies used for smart big data analytics were evaluated. The contribution of this article was then presented. The results have been shown that \u201cdata\u201d is now a new feature to be added as a main component of power systems.", "venue": "2018 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation (ICMA)", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2018-08-01", "journal": {"name": "2018 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation (ICMA)", "pages": "2030-2035"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "98320174", "name": "X.
