Researchers and major corporations are looking into big data applications to extract the maximum value from the data available to them. However, developing and maintaining stable and scalable big data applications is still a distant milestone. Objective: To look at existing research on how software engineering concepts, namely the phases of the software development project life cycle (SDPLC), can help build better big data application projects. Method: A literature survey was performed. A manual search covered papers returned by search engines resulting in approximately 2,000 papers being searched and 170 papers selected for review. Results: The search results helped in identifying data rich application projects that have the potential to utilize big data successfully. The review helped in exploring SDPLC phases in the context of big data applications and performing a gap analysis of the phases that have yet to see detailed research efforts but deserve attention.", "venue": "", "year": null, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2269824084", "name": "Vijay Dipti Kumar"}, {"authorId": "143937733", "name": "P.
