MapReduce-based distributed frameworks have become the general trend in processing SPARQL queries against RDF data. Currently, query processing systems that use MapReduce have not been able to keep up with the increase of semantic annotated data, resulting in non-interactive SPARQL query processing. The principal reason is that intermediate query results from join operations in a MapReduce framework are so massive that they consume all available network bandwidth. In this article, the authors present an efficient SPARQL processing system that uses MapReduce and HBase. The system runs a job optimized query plan using their proposed abstract RDF data to decrease the number of jobs and also decrease the amount of input data. The authors also present an efficient algorithm of using Map-side joins while also using the abstract RDF data to filter out unneeded RDF data. Experimental results show that the proposed approach demonstrates better performance when processing queries with a large amount of input data than those found in previous works.", "venue": "Journal of Database Management", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2019-01-01", "journal": {"name": "J.
