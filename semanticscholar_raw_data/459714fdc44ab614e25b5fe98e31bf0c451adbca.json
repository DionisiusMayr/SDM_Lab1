A significant change occurs in the aspect of security management, particularly in the Information Systems (IS) security within the SC ecosystem. The Information Systems\u2019 security management approach evolves as the organisation model changes. As public sector organisations prepare for SC with the adoption of IoT, revision on the existing security management approach remains critical. The preliminary phase of such revision requires an understanding of the specific challenges that pose risks to the IS security. Therefore, this study identifies the potential challenges by conducting a document analysis method on relevant literature. The findings showed that the IS security management for IoTenabled SC is challenged in terms of governance, integrity, interoperability, personalization, and self-organizing. Understanding these challenges initiates the effort towards revising the management approach, specifically for managing the IS security in IoT-enabled SC.", "venue": "International Conference on Research and Innovation in Information Systems", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2019-12-01", "journal": {"name": "2019 6th International Conference on Research and Innovation in Information Systems (ICRIIS)", "pages": "1-6"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "122741562", "name": "Zarina Din"}, {"authorId": "3367805", "name": "Dian Indrayani Jambari"}, {"authorId": "2086039", "name": "M.
