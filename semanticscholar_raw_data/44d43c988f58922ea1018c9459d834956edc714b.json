Detecting these disorders is crucial for their academic success, and we have conducted a study using a set of online PHQ-9 questionnaire data from a Mexican medical school. By utilizing machine learning techniques, we have demonstrated the potential of this approach to detect these hardly visible mental disorders, achieving a strong predictivity with AUC = 0.69. Furthermore, we utilized regression analysis to determine that item 6 of the PHQ-9 questionnaire is the most significant predictor for students' ideation of dropping out. This study provides a promising approach to detect mental disorders in college-level students, which could help educators and psychiatry specialists target treatment to ensure students' academic success.", "venue": "International Conference on Computer Applications Technology", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-09-15", "journal": {"name": "2023 International Conference on Computer Applications Technology (CCAT)", "pages": "282-286"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2283434533", "name": "Zhao Su"}, {"authorId": "2283126847", "name": "Yun Liu"}, {"authorId": "2258605369", "name": "Xizhe Zhang"}], "citations": []}
