It usually comes at the cost of finding a trade-off between data throughput, latency and the cost of expressive inferences. Strider proposes such a trade-off and combines a scalable RDF stream processing engine with an efficient reasoning system. The main reasoning services are based on a query rewriting approach for SPARQL that benefits from an intelligent encoding of an extension of the RDFS (i.e., RDFS with owl:sameAs) ontology elements. Strider runs in production at a major international water management company to detect anomalies from sensor streams. The system is evaluated along different dimensions and over multiple datasets to emphasize its performance.", "venue": "", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "3464627", "name": "Xiangnan Ren"}, {"authorId": "2067479426", "name": "Cur\u00e9 Olivier"}, {"authorId": "2059922906", "name": "Naacke Hubert"}, {"authorId": "2149141982", "name": "Keran Li"}], "citations": []}
