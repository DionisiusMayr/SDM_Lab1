It is a slow progressive disease affecting the brain cells. This affects the cognitive abilities of people and their daily activities. During the course of the disease, memory gets brutally affected too. Working as well as long-term declarative memory deteriorates in AD patients. Due to this deterioration of the memory, AD patients tend to show a decline in their communicative skills as well. This decline is reflected in their speech. AD patients usually have poor grammar along with very low coherent ideas. Also, they tend to repeat the words very often and hence become unclear on the message they are trying to convey. As the disease progresses, the speech is completely impaired, and the patients are left to sing or utter words that are totally out of context. Stopwords are the words that are most commonly used in language and it is often hypothesized that AD patients use them much often as compared to Control Normal (CN) subjects. It is seen that due to the degeneration of brain cells in AD patients, they have a tendency to use a lot of stopwords to fill their perplexities in their statements. In this paper, the usefulness of the stopwords in capturing the linguistic information of the patients suffering from AD are discussed. Learning algorithms are evaluated by including stopwords and dropping stopwords at preprocessing to draw comparisons.", "venue": "IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2021-07-18", "journal": {"name": "2021 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)", "pages": "1-8"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1992911761", "name": "Surabhi Adhikari"}, {"authorId": "1978790638", "name": "Surendrabikram Thapa"}, {"authorId": "1992896280", "name": "Priyanka Singh"}, {"authorId": "2609599", "name": "Huan Huo"}, {"authorId": "3201199", "name": "Gnana Bharathy"}, {"authorId": "145499331", "name": "M.
