We defined the dimensions and related features to include in the maturity model by analysing the current literature and existing catalogues of semantic artefacts provided by experts. In addition, we assessed 26 different catalogues to demonstrate the effectiveness of the maturity model, which includes 12 different dimensions (Metadata, Openness, Quality, Availability, Statistics, PID, Governance, Community, Sustainability, Technology, Transparency, and Assessment) and 43 related features (or sub-criteria) associated with these dimensions. Such a maturity model is one of the first attempts to provide recommendations for governance and processes for preserving and maintaining semantic artefacts and helps assess/address interoperability challenges.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-05-11", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2305.06746"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "70053552", "name": "\u00d3scar Corcho"}, {"authorId": "2429338", "name": "Fajar J.
