In order to effectively meet the actual industrial field requirements of the serial communication capacity and quality, some technical treatment can be taken. On the one hand, multi-serial port software technology is used to realize serial communication concurrent operation; on the other hand, multi-thread technology is adopted to realize the reasonable allocation of serial communication resources. Firstly, the multi-serial port software communication architecture is established; secondly, by the multi-threaded means, to the communication resources of the serial port is optimize; finally, based on Map-Reduce technology, the multi-level mapping association between the communication data and the communication serial ports is established. The simulation results show that the multi-serial communication which based on the Map-Reduce technology not only improves the efficiency of multi-serial communication, but also effectively integrates multi-serial communication redundancy data.", "venue": "2017 International Conference on Computer Systems, Electronics and Control (ICCSEC)", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2017-12-01", "journal": {"name": "2017 International Conference on Computer Systems, Electronics and Control (ICCSEC)", "pages": "532-536"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2118404748", "name": "Rui Zhang"}], "citations": []}
