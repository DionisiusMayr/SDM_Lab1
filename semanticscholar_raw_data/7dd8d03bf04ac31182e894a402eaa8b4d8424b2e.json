However, due to the resource constraints of edge clouds, edge servers are more prone to failures than other systems. Therefore, guaranteeing the reliability of services in edge clouds is critical. In this paper, we propose a fault-tolerant adaptive scheduling mechanism with dynamic quality of service (QoS) awareness (FASDQ), which extends the primary/backup (PB) model by applying QoS on demand to task copies. The aim of the method is to reduce the latency and achieve reliable service for tasks by changing the execution time of task copies. This paper also proposes a container resource-adaptive adjustment mechanism, which adjusts the timing of resources when the available resources cannot meet the task copy requirements. Finally, this paper reports the results of simulation experiments on the EdgeCloudSim platform to evaluate the difference in performance between FASDQ and other methods. The results show that the mechanism effectively reduces the execution time of task copies and outperforms other methods in terms of reliability and general resource utilization.", "venue": "Italian National Conference on Sensors", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-04-23", "journal": {"name": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "volume": "21"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2128116063", "name": "Ruifeng Wang"}, {"authorId": "1706530", "name": "Ningjiang Chen"}, {"authorId": "2087141577", "name": "Xuyi Yao"}, {"authorId": "2118850020", "name": "Liangqing Hu"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "9bc044be4b748c808cee062bbef3cd3dee3aa52c", "title": "Editorial: Special Issue \u201cEdge and Fog Computing for Internet of Things Systems\u201d"}, {"paperId": "7e8d52c97aa5d3b9c167f1ea2410d23008b19e39", "title": "Secure and failure hybrid delay enabled a lightweight RPC and SHDS schemes in Industry 4.0 aware IIoHT enabled fog computing."}]}
