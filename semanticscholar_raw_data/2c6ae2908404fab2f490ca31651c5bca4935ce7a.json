These applications tend to be user-facing and latency-sensitive, and our goal is to continuously minimize the amount of CPU resources allocated while still satisfying the application latency SLO. Although previous efforts have proposed simple heuristics and sophisticated ML-based techniques, we believe that a practical resource manager should accurately scale CPU resources for diverse applications, with minimum human efforts and operation overheads. To this end, we ask: can we systematically break resource management down to subproblems solvable by practical policies? Based on the notion of CPU-throttle-based performance target, we decouple the mechanisms of SLO feedback and resource control, and implement a two-level framework\u2014 Autothrottle . It combines a lightweight learned controller at the global level, and agile per-microservice controllers at the local level. We evaluate Autothrottle on three microservice applications, with both short-term and 21-day production workload traces. Empirical results show Autothrottle\u2019s superior CPU core savings up to 26.21% over the best-performing baselines across applications, while maintaining the latency SLO.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2212.12180"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2117414230", "name": "Zibo Wang"}, {"authorId": "2198272189", "name": "Pinghe Li"}, {"authorId": "2745171", "name": "C.
