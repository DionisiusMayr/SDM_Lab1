Serving machine learning models over streams of data creates a number of interesting systems challenges in managing data routing, time-synchronization, and rate control. This paper presents EdgeServe, a distributed streaming system that can serve predictions from machine learning models in real time. We evaluate EdgeServe on three streaming prediction tasks: (1) human activity recognition, (2) autonomous driving, and (3) network intrusion detection.", "venue": "", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2023-03-02", "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2123128030", "name": "Ted Shaowang"}, {"authorId": "2237986948", "name": "Sanjay Krishnan"}], "citations": []}
