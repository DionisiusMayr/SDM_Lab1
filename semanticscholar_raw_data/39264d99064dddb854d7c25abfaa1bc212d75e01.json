In the established formal framework, probabilistic (relational) databases\nare finite probability spaces over relational database instances. This\nfiniteness can clash with intuitive query behavior (Ceylan et al., KR 2016),\nand with application scenarios that are better modeled by continuous\nprobability distributions (Dalvi et al., CACM 2009).\n We formally introduced infinite PDBs in (Grohe and Lindner, PODS 2019) with a\nprimary focus on countably infinite spaces. However, an extension beyond\ncountable probability spaces raises nontrivial foundational issues concerned\nwith the measurability of events and queries and ultimately with the question\nwhether queries have a well-defined semantics.\n We argue that finite point processes are an appropriate model from\nprobability theory for dealing with general probabilistic databases. This\nallows us to construct suitable (uncountable) probability spaces of database\ninstances in a systematic way. Our main technical results are measurability\nstatements for relational algebra queries as well as aggregate queries and\nDatalog queries.", "venue": "International Conference on Database Theory", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2019-04-14", "journal": {"pages": "16:1-16:20"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1744396", "name": "Martin Grohe"}, {"authorId": "1398932539", "name": "P.
