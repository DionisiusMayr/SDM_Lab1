Data streams have been extensively used in several fields of computational analytics such as data mining, business intelligence etc. [17]. In every field, the data stream can be considered as an ordered sequence of data items, as they continuously arrive over the period. Due to this characteristic, streaming data analytics is a challenging area of research [5, 11]. This paper aims to present data stream processing as a growing research field , along with streaming analytics frameworks as a rich focus area. The paper also contributes to evaluate the efficacy of available stream analytics frameworks. One of the Industry 4.0 use case - predictive maintenance rail transportation - has been illustrated here as a case study design mapped with streaming analytics framework.", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2021-05-28", "journal": {"name": "", "pages": "423-432", "volume": ""}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3500957", "name": "Shailaja B.
