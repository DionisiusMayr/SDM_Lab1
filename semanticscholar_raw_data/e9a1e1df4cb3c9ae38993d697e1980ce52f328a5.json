In this paper, we propose a federated sampling and lightweight intrusion-detection system for IoT networks that use K-meansfor sampling network traffic and identifying anomalies in a semi-supervised way. The system is designed to preserve data privacy by performing local clustering on each device and sharing only summary statistics with a central aggregator. The proposed system is particularly suitable for resource-constrained IoT devices such as sensors with limited computational and storage capabilities. We evaluate the system\u2019s performance using the publicly available NSL-KDD dataset. Our experiments and simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed intrusion-detection system, highlighting the trade-offs between precision and recall when sharing statistics between workers and the coordinator. Notably, our experiments show that the proposed federated IDS can increase the true-positive rate up to 10% when the workers and the coordinator collaborate.", "venue": "Italian National Conference on Sensors", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-08-01", "journal": {"name": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "volume": "23"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2088822126", "name": "Suzan Hajj"}, {"authorId": "46253225", "name": "Joseph Azar"}, {"authorId": "2124242221", "name": "Jacques Bou Abdo"}, {"authorId": "2932782", "name": "J.
