While the physical space is virtually enhanced with information, the virtual space is continuously refreshed with real-time, real-world information. To allow users to process and manipulate information seamlessly between the real and digital spaces, novel technologies must be developed. These include smart interfaces, new augmented realities, e\ufb03cient storage and data management and dissemination techniques. In this paper, we \ufb01rst discuss some promising co-space applications. These applications o\ufb00er experiences and opportunities that neither of the spaces can realize on its own. We then argue that the database community has much to o\ufb00er to this \ufb01eld. Finally, we present several challenges that we, as a community, can contribute towards managing the metaverse.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2206.10326"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1693070", "name": "B.
