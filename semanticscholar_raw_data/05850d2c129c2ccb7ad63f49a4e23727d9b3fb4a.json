The integration is based on mathematical logic and artificial intelligence. Key elements of the approach - a multilevel system architecture, formal logical system, implementation - are based on intelligent agents' interaction. The formal logical system is proposed. The inference method and mechanism of solution tree recovery are elaborated. The implementation of application integration for interdisciplinary scientific research is based on a stack of modern protocols, enabling communication of business processes over the transport layer of the OSI model. Application integration is also based on coordinated models of business processes, for which an integrated set of business applications are designed and realized.", "venue": "Journal of Automation, Mobile Robotics & Intelligent Systems", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-09-28", "journal": {"name": "Journal of Automation, Mobile Robotics and Intelligent Systems"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2058303883", "name": "Grzegorz Nowakowski"}, {"authorId": "3205613", "name": "S.
