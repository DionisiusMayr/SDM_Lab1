In this paper, we present a big data analytics layer/framework for competitive intelligence systems and we implement it in the case of XEW 2.0 system relying on Apache Spark capabilities and big data analytics technologies, we validate the proposed framework with a case study about Research in Morocco in order to achieve a technological surveillance, the framework shows promising results in providing analysts with a toolbox to extract strategic information.", "venue": "", "year": null, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "1500652370", "name": "Bouktaib Adil"}, {"authorId": "2260386929", "name": "Fenan Abdelhadi"}], "citations": []}
