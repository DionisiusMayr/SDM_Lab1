Data analytics is a concept of processing raw data and analysing the output for various beneficial reasons. There are four types of data analytics stated in this paper, those are descriptive analytics, diagnostic analytics, predictive analytics, and prescriptive analytics. Data itself contains unstructured, semi-structured and structured data. We compare the privacy-preserving techniques in data analytics to see whether the techniques are suitable or unsuitable to be applied in data analytics.", "venue": "IEEE International Conference on Signal and Image Processing", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2021-10-22", "journal": {"name": "2021 IEEE 6th International Conference on Signal and Image Processing (ICSIP)", "pages": "1048-1052"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2151501844", "name": "Norsyahirah Khairul Anuar"}, {"authorId": "3035191", "name": "A.
