Although there exist approaches that use DW in the judicial domain, few target the pandemic or publicly provide the information extracted from the texts. Following the needs of a legal expert, we have developed the COVID-19 Portal. It extracts documents from the Supreme Federal Court in Brazil to obtain quantitative information on words used in the texts. In this paper, we present the design of a DW, and show the query performance improvement achieved with its implementation. The DW has been developed on Postgres, and its performance is compared with the original implementation on MongoDB Cloud and a local MongoDB database.", "venue": "Anais Estendidos do XXXVI Simp\u00f3sio Brasileiro de Banco de Dados (SBBD Estendido 2021)", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2021-10-04", "journal": {"name": "Anais Estendidos do XXXVI Simp\u00f3sio Brasileiro de Banco de Dados (SBBD Estendido 2021)"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2145685561", "name": "Ana Paula Sodr\u00e9"}, {"authorId": "2145681349", "name": "Luis Eduardo Mochenski Floriano"}, {"authorId": "1643874211", "name": "Dimmy Magalh\u00e3es"}, {"authorId": "2145011416", "name": "C.
