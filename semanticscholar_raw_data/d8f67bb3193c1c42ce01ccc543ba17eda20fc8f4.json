Related work and physical background are mentioned first, followed by the experimental results. The paper is focused mainly on the interpretation of the data obtained from the models\u2019 simulation process with the help of Augmented Reality. The experimental deployment offers promising results and presents the way for further development in this field.", "venue": "", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2018-08-18", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Mining, Reclamation and Environment", "pages": "449 - 462", "volume": "32"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "8982816", "name": "P.
