However, traditional topic models often suffer from several limitations, such as being sensitive to the order of words in documents and not being able to capture the semantic similarity between words. In this paper, we introduce SimilarBERT. A framework designed for topic modeling using BERT embeddings. SimilarBERT integrates sentence embedding, clustering, outlier detection, topic descriptions, evaluation metrics, and a variety of visualizations to form a cohesive topic modeling pipeline. To assess the effectiveness of SimilarBERT, an experiment was conducted using the Quora Question Pairs dataset. The results showcase SimilarBERT\u2019s ability to extract and evaluate topics, ultimately resulting in a comprehensive list of clusters, accompanied by relevant descriptions providing insight into the content of the clusters. Evaluation of topics is carried out with emphasis on topic similarity, and particularly focusing on inter-document relationships within each topic. Our results demonstrate that SimilarBERT is an effective way to discover topics in text data.", "venue": "Journ\u00e9es Francophones d'Ing\u00e9nierie des Connaissances", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2024-02-08", "journal": {"name": "2024 2nd International Conference on Computer, Communication and Control (IC4)", "pages": "1-6"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2295218440", "name": "Sule Mohammed"}, {"authorId": "2295135537", "name": "Bhavesh M.
