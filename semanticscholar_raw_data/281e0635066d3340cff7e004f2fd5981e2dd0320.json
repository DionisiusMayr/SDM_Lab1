Or else, traditional sequential pattern-mining algorithms cannot be applied efficiently or directly to remote sensing images. Here a new technique is proposed for enhancing the mining efficacy of spatial sequential patterns from raster serial remote sensing images (SRSI) based on pixel grouping approach. The modified extrema pattern is employed to offering grey-scale invariant transform of intensity values unlike previously employed local ternary pattern. The pattern features are computed by transformation process from which the multilinear matrix decomposition of the image is made by computing the covariance estimation on recognizing their orthogonal component. The matrix decomposition is then attained based on run length encoding process (RLC). The two rows of RLC vectors are intersected to attain pixel group matrix. Finally, the compressed image is attained in an efficient manner with effective mining time. The performance outcome reveals that the technique offered in this paper is capable of extracting spatial sequential patterns from SRSI effectively. The proposed system ensures that the entire patterns are extracted at a lower time consumption.", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "9211818", "name": "G.
