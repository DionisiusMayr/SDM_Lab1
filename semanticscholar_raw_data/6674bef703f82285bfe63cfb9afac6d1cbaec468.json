Here, we propose a new, low-cost and stand-alone sensor setup that employs machine learning on an embedded device, so-called edge machine learning. We train an artificial neural network with data acquired from a continuous-wave ODMR setup and subsequently use this pre-trained network on the sensor device to deduce the magnitude of the magnetic field from recorded ODMR spectra. In our proposed sensor setup, a low-cost and low-power ESP32 microcontroller development board is employed to control data recording and perform inference of the network. In a proof-of-concept study, we show that the setup is capable of measuring magnetic fields with high precision and has the potential to enable robust and accessible sensor applications with a wide measuring range.", "venue": "Italian National Conference on Sensors", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-01-18", "journal": {"name": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "volume": "23"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2203541800", "name": "J.
