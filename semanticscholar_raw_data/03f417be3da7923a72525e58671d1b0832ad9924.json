As data scientists, we tend to prefer to isolate and formalize equity problems to make them amenable to narrow technical solutions. However, this reductionist approach is inadequate in practice. In this article, we attempt to address data equity broadly, identify different ways in which it is manifest in data-driven systems, and propose a research agenda.", "venue": "EDBT/ICDT Workshops", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-02-07", "journal": {"name": "ACM Journal of Data and Information Quality", "pages": "1 - 21", "volume": "14"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "145531067", "name": "H.
