CNNs are the most preferable network architecture for identifying and recognizing objects, which makes them ideal for applications requiring critical object detection and computer vision requirements. CNN has recently experienced rapid growth owing to factors like providing higher accuracy and efficiency in computer recognition problems, having access to enormous digital data and the availability of high processing power. This paper discusses the variants of CNN and the areas in which they are deployed.", "venue": "2023 International Conference on Intelligent Systems for Communication, IoT and Security (ICISCoIS)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-02-09", "journal": {"name": "2023 International Conference on Intelligent Systems for Communication, IoT and Security (ICISCoIS)", "pages": "31-36"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2148703440", "name": "Shruti P"}, {"authorId": "2148742185", "name": "R.
