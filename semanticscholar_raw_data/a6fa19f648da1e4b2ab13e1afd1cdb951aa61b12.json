Bond graphs provide a modelling framework that describes energy flow through a physical system and by construction enforce thermodynamic constraints. The framework is widely used in engineering and has recently been shown to be a powerful approach for modelling biology. Models are mutable, hierarchical, multi-scale, multi-physics, and BondGraphs.jl is compatible with the Julia modelling ecosystem. Availability and Implementation BondGraphs.jl is freely available under the MIT license. Source code and documentation can be found at https://github.com/jedforrest/BondGraphs.jl.
