This study examined writings on social media over 12 weeks from people who self-reported having tested positive for COVID-19. People used fewer words reflecting anxiety and distancing but more words indicating reinterpretation over time. The language patterns for describing the experience of COVID-19 infections differed from those for describing other unrelated topics. The findings reveal the temporal dynamics of psychological adjustment to an unfolding crisis.", "venue": "Journal of Language and Social Psychology", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-07-21", "journal": {"name": "Journal of Language and Social Psychology", "pages": "203 - 216", "volume": "42"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2145238075", "name": "Xun Zhu"}], "citations": []}
