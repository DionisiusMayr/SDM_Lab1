Although the choice of the state store is crucial for the system\u2019s performance, there has been little research in designing state stores tailored for streaming workloads. Streaming systems use general-purpose KV stores, such as RocksDB, to manage state. Being oblivious to workload characteristics of streaming applications, such stores incur unnecessary overheads. Our methodology to tackle this challenge consists of the following steps. First, we have been conducting a thorough study of streaming state workloads to further the understanding of their characteristics and differences from traditional work-loads. Second, we are developing a new benchmark that can faithfully mimic streaming state workloads and enables researchers to easily evaluate alternative store designs. Our long-term goal is to design and develop workload-aware streaming state management to improve the latency and throughput of streaming analytics. 1", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2139266076", "name": "Showan Esmail Asyabi"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "edb0c0907548a72220ca375aeda8fe9d2cceea61", "title": "FlowKV: A Semantic-Aware Store for Large-Scale State Management of Stream Processing Engines"}]}
