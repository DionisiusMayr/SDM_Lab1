Ap-proximate Query Processing (AQP) is one such area where machine learning (ML) models have been used to improve query execution efficiency and accuracy, outperforming the traditional sampling-based approaches. Based on our group\u2019s experience in the ML-for-DBs area, [3\u20137, 29, 37\u201339], we contribute a novel AQP engine, coined DBEst++ , which extends our previous effort (DBEst, [29]) and sets the state of the art in terms of accuracy and query execution efficiency. The DBEst++ salient design objective is to derive lightweight ML models for the task, allowing a plethora of ML models to coexist, covering a very large fraction of the expected analytical query workload without requiring very large memory footprints. The DBEst++ salient architectural feature rests on a novel blending of word embedding models with neural networks tasked with regression-based predictions for density estimation and aggregation-attribute values. We present design features and motivations/rationale behind DBEst++ and discuss how all the ML models are brought together. We also present how DBEst++ can deal with challenging scenarios, including how to deal with high-cardinality categorical attributes and how to ensure high accuracy under data updates. We provide a detailed experimental evaluation using the TPC-DS and Flights datasets against state of the art learned and sampling-based AQP engines, showcasing DBEst++ \u2019s gains in terms of accuracy, response-times, and memory space overheads.", "venue": "Conference on Innovative Data Systems Research", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2087919519", "name": "Qingzhi Ma"}, {"authorId": "2034659", "name": "A.
