This paper discusses challenges and techniques in optimizing HHVM performance for Meta's web service. We begin by evaluating the effectiveness of semantic request routing, a request routing method aimed at enhancing code cache performance in HHVM, and examine its implications for optimizing HHVM performance. Second, we characterize HHVM performance for a large-scale datacenter and identify the challenges brought by uncontrollable confounding factors. Finally, we present the performance management framework for autotuning HHVM performance at scale.", "venue": "International Conference on Performance Engineering", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-04-15", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 2023 ACM/SPEC International Conference on Performance Engineering"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2213119127", "name": "Yuhao Li"}, {"authorId": "2186147778", "name": "Abhishek Gupta"}, {"authorId": "2213531774", "name": "Alex Yang"}, {"authorId": "2158503378", "name": "Peinan Chen"}, {"authorId": "2212892373", "name": "Joey Pinto"}, {"authorId": "2796576", "name": "B.
