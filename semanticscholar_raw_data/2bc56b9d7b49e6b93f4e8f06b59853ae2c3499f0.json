We show how common bioinformatics workloads can cause VMs to age after several days, causing a large number of Extended Page Table (EPT) violations that signi\ufb01cantly impact performance. We present host-and VM-level EPT monitoring and evaluate several possible mitigation scenarios. We highlight the long investigative process required for this research, with experiments requiring many days to complete.", "venue": "USENIX Annual Technical Conference", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"pages": "973-988"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "32249376", "name": "M.
