The notion of utility computing, however, has remained constant throughout its evolution, which means that cloud users always seek to save costs of leasing cloud resources while maximizing their use. On the other hand, cloud providers try to maximize their profits while assuring service-level objectives of the cloud-hosted applications and keeping operational costs low. All these outcomes require systematic and sound cloud engineering principles. The aim of this paper is to highlight the importance of cloud engineering, survey the landscape of best practices in cloud engineering and its evolution, discuss many of the existing cloud engineering advances, and identify both the inherent technical challenges and research opportunities for the future of cloud computing in general and cloud engineering in particular.", "venue": "2021 IEEE International Conference on Cloud Engineering (IC2E)", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2021-08-19", "journal": {"name": "2021 IEEE International Conference on Cloud Engineering (IC2E)", "pages": "264-275"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3077067", "name": "David Bermbach"}, {"authorId": "144114650", "name": "A.
