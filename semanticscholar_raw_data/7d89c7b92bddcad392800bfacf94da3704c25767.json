The algorithm is based on PageRank, the kernel of Google's webpage ranking algorithm. Changes are suggested to enable PageRank to rank countries based on historic signed political and trade treaties. Relative changes in the ranking of countries can be observed by executing the algorithm on a sliding window over time. The algorithm is demonstrated on a case study period. The results show that the proposed approach does indeed rank countries sensibly in the period under consideration.", "venue": "International Conference on Information and Software Technologies", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2018-06-01", "journal": {"name": "2018 Eighth International Conference on Information Science and Technology (ICIST)", "pages": "224-230"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "121011280", "name": "Mathys C. du Plessis"}], "citations": []}
