However, state-of-the-art dataflow engines, such as Spark and Flink, do not support nested parallelism. Users must implement workarounds, causing orders of magnitude slowdowns for their tasks, let alone the implementation effort. We present Matryoshka, a system that enables dataflow engines to support nested parallelism, even in the presence of control flow statements at inner nesting levels. Matryoshka achieves this via a novel two-phase flattening process, which translates nested-parallel programs to flat-parallel programs that can efficiently run on existing dataflow engines. The first phase introduces novel nesting primitives into the code, which allows for dynamic optimizations based on intermediate data characteristics in the second phase at runtime. We validate our system using several common data analysis tasks, such as PageRank and K-means.", "venue": "SIGMOD Conference", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2021-06-09", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 2021 International Conference on Management of Data"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2847234", "name": "G.
