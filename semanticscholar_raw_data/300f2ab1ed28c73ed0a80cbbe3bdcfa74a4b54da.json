Despite scientific evidence supporting the biostimulant action of PHs on vegetables, the morphological, physiological, and shelf-life performances underlying the PH action on cut flowers are still poorly explored. Accordingly, the aim of this research is to assess the effects of three commercial biostimulants, one animal PH (PH A, Hicure\u00ae) and two plant PHs (PH V1, Trainer\u00ae and PH V2, Vegamin\u00a9), on two chrysanthemum (Chrysanthemum morifolium) cultivars (Pinacolada and Radost). In both cultivars, only the plant-derived PH (V1 and V2) treatments recorded significantly higher fresh plant biomass than the control (on average +18%, in both cultivars). The foliar application of the vegetal-derived PHs but not the animal one, particularly in Pinacolada, improved the status of plants, stimulating stem elongation and the apical flower diameter. In Pinacolada, applications with PH V1 resulted in a significant increase in nitrate and P concentration in leaves and Ca content in flowers compared with the control (+43%, +27%, and +28% for nitrate, P, and Ca, respectively). In Radost, PH A and PH V2 applications caused a significant reduction in nitrate concentration in both leaves and flowers compared with the control. One week after harvest, in both cultivars, PH A applications caused flower stems to wilt faster than the control. In contrast, plants treated with PH V1 revealed significantly slower flower stem senescence compared to the control. Flower wilting during vase life was correlated to a decrease in the K-to-Na ratio in flowers due to an inability to transport K to the flowers from the leaves rather than an increase in Na in the flowers themselves.", "venue": "Plants", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-09-01", "journal": {"name": "Plants", "volume": "11"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "145793619", "name": "P.
