In particular, we observe that systems' abstractions limit their ability to share and reuse indexed state within and across computations. These limitations result in an inability to express and efficiently implement algorithms in domains where the scales of data call for them most. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of K-Pg, a data-processing framework that provides high-throughput, low-latency incremental view maintenance for a general class of iterative data-parallel computations. This class includes SQL, stratified Datalog with negation and non-monotonic aggregates, and much of graph processing. Our evaluation indicates that K-Pg's performance is either comparable to, or exceeds, that of specialized systems in multiple domains, while at the same time significantly generalizing their capabilities.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2018-12-06", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/1812.02639"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3137076", "name": "Frank McSherry"}, {"authorId": "3416365", "name": "Andrea Lattuada"}, {"authorId": "1962485", "name": "Malte Schwarzkopf"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "661e045fb4f973e88bde5c2d37ebd4f492edbca6", "title": "SmartDL: energy-aware decremental learning in a mobile-based federation for geo-spatial system"}, {"paperId": "98c755d1d6bc9d7b5928b79954eec280d9f74b68", "title": "Online Analysis of Distributed Dataflows with Timely Dataflow"}]}
