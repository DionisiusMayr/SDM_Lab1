The compatibility of these materials with natural gas including of hydrogen is dependent on the proportion of hydrogen added to the gas and is assessed with regard to several criteria: Permeation of hydrogen through metallic materials; loss of integrity of these materials and adaptation of follow-up actions in service, surveillance and maintenance of equipment. This paper is devoted to the effect of hydrogen embrittlement (HE) by adding hydrogen into natural gas network on design, maintenance, supervision and maximum allowable operating pressure (MAOP) for smooth and damaged pipes.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Materials Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2020-11-21", "journal": {"name": "", "pages": "61-82", "volume": ""}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2275859360", "name": "Jamie Kuk Anak Mijim"}, {"authorId": "20695026", "name": "G.
