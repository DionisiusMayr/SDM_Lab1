Yet rightsizing serverless functions remains a pain point for developers. Choosing the right memory configuration is necessary to ensure cost and/or performance optimality for serverless workloads. In this work, we identify that using parametric regression can significantly simplify function rightsizing compared to black-box optimization techniques currently available. With this insight, we build a tool, called Parrotfish, which finds optimal configurations through an online learning process. It also allows users to communicate constraints on execution time, or to relax cost optimality to gain performance. Parrotfish achieves substantially lower exploration costs (1.81-9.96\u00d7) compared with the state-of-the-art tools, while delivering similar or better recommendations.", "venue": "ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-10-30", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 2023 ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2256794169", "name": "Arshia Moghimi"}, {"authorId": "2191730983", "name": "Joe Hattori"}, {"authorId": "2258555950", "name": "Alexander Li"}, {"authorId": "2268776851", "name": "Mehdi Ben Chikha"}, {"authorId": "2256797523", "name": "Mohammad Shahrad"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "b582117a278f54acf1e0623ff51bf9a8e21afbc9", "title": "Shabari: Delayed Decision-Making for Faster and Efficient Serverless Functions"}, {"paperId": "c9f749be5327c3515520aa177d6a6599a7ac0879", "title": "Zenix: Efficient Execution of Bulky Serverless Applications"}]}
