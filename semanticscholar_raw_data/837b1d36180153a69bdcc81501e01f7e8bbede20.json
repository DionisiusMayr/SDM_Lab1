The real-time scheduling of gigabyte-level images and the storage and management of massive image datasets are incredibly challenging for current hardware, networking and storage systems. This paper\u2019s three novel strategies (ring caching, multi-threading and tile-prefetching mechanisms) are designed to comprehensively optimize the remote sensing image scheduling process from image retrieval, transmission and visualization perspectives. A novel remote sensing image management and scheduling system (RSIMSS) is designed using these three strategies as its core algorithm, the PostgreSQL database and HDFS distributed file system as its underlying storage system, and the multilayer Hilbert spatial index and image tile pyramid to organize massive remote sensing image datasets. Test results show that the RSIMSS provides efficient and stable image storage performance and allows real-time image scheduling and view roaming.", "venue": "ISPRS Int. J.
