Here, we introduce an intuitive and efficient clustering method, Forest Fire Clustering, for discovering and validating cell types in single-cell sequencing analysis. Compared to existing methods, our clustering algorithm makes minimum prior assumptions about the data distribution and can provide a point-wise significance value via Monte Carlo simulations for internal validation. Additionally, point-wise label entropies can highlight novel transition cell types de novo along developmental pseudo-time manifolds. Lastly, our inductive algorithm has the ability to make robust inferences in an online-learning context. In this paper, we describe the method, provide a summary of its performance against common clustering benchmarks, and demonstrate that Forest Fire Clustering is uniquely suitable for single-cell sequencing analysis.", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "1736742655", "name": "Zhanlin Chen"}, {"authorId": "2067298269", "name": "Jeremy Goldwasser"}, {"authorId": "1854415610", "name": "Philip Tuckman"}, {"authorId": "48211623", "name": "Jason Liu"}, {"authorId": "91744486", "name": "Jing Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2240866626", "name": "Mark Gerstein"}], "citations": []}
