This is made possible by the superior expressive power that database aggregates bring to recursive queries and the realization of their powerful non-monotonic semantics via ef\ufb01cient and scalable \ufb01xpoint-base operational semantics. Thus, in this paper, we discuss how classical algorithms can be expressed concisely using queries with aggregates in recursion that have a rigorous declarative semantics. Then we discuss what modi\ufb01cations, if any, are needed on such programs to have an ef\ufb01cient and scalable \ufb01xpoint-based operational semantics, whereby we can also identify queries that are conducive to bulk-synchronous and stale-synchronous parallelism.", "venue": "IEEE Data Engineering Bulletin", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "IEEE Data Eng.
