For this reason, there is a growing interest in single-round multiway join algorithms where data are first reshuffled over many servers and then evaluated in a parallel but communication-free way. The reshuffling itself is specified as a distribution policy. We introduce a correctness condition, called parallel-correctness, for the evaluation of queries w.r.t. a distribution policy. We study the complexity of parallel-correctness for conjunctive queries as well as transferability of parallel-correctness between queries. We also investigate the complexity of transferability for certain families of distribution policies, including the Hypercube distribution policies.", "venue": "Journal of the ACM", "year": 2014, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book"], "publicationDate": "2014-12-12", "journal": {"name": "Journal of the ACM (JACM)", "pages": "1 - 38", "volume": "64"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1785809", "name": "Tom J.
