We compare the container-based model with VM-based model and conclude that the former significantly supersedes. The benchmark of three mainstream algorithms is conducted by the Hypervolume metric, showed that the performance of MOEA/D is inferior to NSGA family, and NSGA-III is not always superior to NSGA-II. So we design an improved NSGA-II based on dynamically changing crossover and mutation operators, which outperforms NSGA-III both in stability and performance by over 60% and 80% in all multi-scale tests.", "venue": "Enterprise Information Systems", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-05-03", "journal": {"name": "Enterprise Information Systems", "volume": "17"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "50695567", "name": "Shi Wang"}, {"authorId": "40913460", "name": "X.
