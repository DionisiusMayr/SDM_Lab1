This study aims to determine teachers' perceptions of hybrid learning media with a more accurate and precise method, namely the item response theory (IRT) from the Rasch model. The survey was carried out by distributing a Likert scale questionnaire of 19 statements. Moreover, the subjects were 45 elementary school teachers in Riau Province, Indonesia. The results showed that they positively perceived the developed genially-based learning media. Genially learning media can support teachers in teaching. Based on these results, teachers need to develop skills in making various technology-based media, in order to support hybrid learning.", "venue": "Indonesian Journal on Learning and Advanced Education (IJOLAE)", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2021-12-24", "journal": {"name": "Indonesian Journal on Learning and Advanced Education (IJOLAE)"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "122735653", "name": "N.
