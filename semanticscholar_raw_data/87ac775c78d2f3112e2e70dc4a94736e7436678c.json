Indeed advances in Big Data technologies have improved the creation of intelligent and powerful environments for a number of complex issues, such as the case discussed in this paper concerning the collaboration of transport providers. We will provide a conceptual model of DSS as multilayers architecture, which offers a set of services, namely the transport optimization that favor the efficiency of vehicle fleet operations, the collection and integration of real-time data sent by in-vehicle IOT technologies, allowing analysis and Realtime tracking of vehicles as well as freight. Through dashboards, decision makers can visualize the details of operations and interact according to system recommendations.", "venue": "2018 International Colloquium on Logistics and Supply Chain Management (LOGISTIQUA)", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2018-04-01", "journal": {"name": "2018 International Colloquium on Logistics and Supply Chain Management (LOGISTIQUA)", "pages": "211-215", "volume": "00212667984883"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "30576317", "name": "Abdelghani Saoud"}, {"authorId": "9194990", "name": "A.
