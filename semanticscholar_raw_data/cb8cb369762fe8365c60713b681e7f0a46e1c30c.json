Kruskal\u2019s algorithm is one of the classical methods to find the minimum spanning tree. Aiming at the problem that the root node search time accounts for a high proportion of the Kruskal\u2019s algorithm, according to the characteristics of real world graph data, this paper presents a hardware accelerator Mr-Kru for the Kruskal\u2019s algorithm to find the root node in parallel based on the Coordinate(COO) compression format. In this paper, the prototype system is built on the Virtex UltraScale+VCU118 evaluation platform, and complete the hardware testing of Mr_Kru based on four different datasets. The experimental results show that the running time of parallel mode is 34.9%~41.6% lower than that of serial mode. The resource cost is 97.6% and 99.6% lower than that of the comparative literature. Vivado simulation power consumption is 2. 671W.", "venue": "International Conference on Information Communication and Management", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-10-28", "journal": {"name": "2022 7th International Conference on Integrated Circuits and Microsystems (ICICM)", "pages": "230-235"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3314658", "name": "Junyong Deng"}, {"authorId": "2185510101", "name": "Baoxiang Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2185585770", "name": "Xiaoliang Fu"}, {"authorId": "150345021", "name": "Xiaoyan Xie"}, {"authorId": "2201664103", "name": "Jingwen Deng"}, {"authorId": "46218030", "name": "Zekun Ye"}], "citations": []}
