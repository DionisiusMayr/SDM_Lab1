These unique properties helped its pioneering algorithm, the Density-based Spatial Clustering on Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), become applicable in datasets where various number of clusters of different shapes and sizes could be detected without much interference from the user. However, the original algorithm exhibits limitations, especially towards its sensitivity on its user input parameters minPts and \u025b. Additionally, the algorithm assigned inconsistent cluster labels to data objects found in overlapping density regions of separate clusters, hence lowering its accuracy. To alleviate these specific problems and increase the clustering accuracy, we propose two methods that use the statistical data from a given dataset\u2019s k-nearest neighbor density distribution in order to determine the optimal \u025b values. Our approach removes the burden on the users, and automatically detects the clusters of a given dataset. Furthermore, a method to identify the accurate border objects of separate clusters is proposed and implemented to solve the unpredictability of the original algorithm. Finally, in our experiments, we show that our efficient re-implementation of the original algorithm to automatically cluster datasets and improve the clustering quality of adjoining cluster members provides increase in clustering accuracy and faster running times when compared to earlier approaches.", "venue": "PeerJ Computer Science", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-03-14", "journal": {"name": "PeerJ Computer Science"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2114849194", "name": "Adil Abdu Bushra"}, {"authorId": "2259483292", "name": "Dongyeon Kim"}, {"authorId": "2186692844", "name": "Yejin Kan"}, {"authorId": "2259023474", "name": "Gangman Yi"}], "citations": []}
