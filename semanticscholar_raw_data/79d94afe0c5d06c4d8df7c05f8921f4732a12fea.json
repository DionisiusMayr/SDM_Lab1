These environments employ multiple sensor networks, whose data must be acquired and processed in real time by multiple rule engines, which trigger events that enable specific actuators. The problem is how to handle those data in a scalable manner by using multiple processing instances to maximize the system throughput. This paper considers the types of sensors that are used in these scenarios and proposes a model for abstracting the information flow as a weighted dependency graph. Two parallel computing methods are then proposed for obtaining an efficient data flow: a variation of the parallel k-means clustering algorithm and a custom genetic algorithm. Simulation results show that the two proposed flow reconfiguration algorithms reduce the rule processing times and provide an efficient solution for increasing the scalability of the considered environment. Another aspect being discussed is using an open-source cloud solution to manage the system and how to use the two algorithms to increase efficiency. These methods allow for a seamless increase in the number of sensors in the environment by making smart use of the available resources.", "venue": "Italian National Conference on Sensors", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-01-31", "journal": {"name": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "volume": "23"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "145980550", "name": "A.
