For data capture, smartphones and embedded sensors are an increasingly reliable, accurate and fast way to detect certain types of bio signals. In this study we propose a system for collecting data for the acquisition and study of associated diseases and symptoms to demonstrate how the use of sensors and their connection to a database and later application of methods to detect patterns to remove conclusions and contribute to advances in health and to a higher quality of life especially in the elderly.", "venue": "2020 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2020-12-10", "journal": {"name": "2020 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "pages": "3721-3726"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2061475414", "name": "Andr\u00e9 Esteves"}, {"authorId": "1395906171", "name": "Vasco Ponciano"}, {"authorId": "34362859", "name": "I.
