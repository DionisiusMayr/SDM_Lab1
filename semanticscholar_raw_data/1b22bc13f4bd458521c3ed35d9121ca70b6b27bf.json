The challenges for the next generation depend on increasing the high data traffic in the wireless communication system for both EE and SE. In this paper, the trade off energy efficiency and spectral efficiency based on the first derivative of transmit antennas and transmit power in a downlink massive MIMO system has been investigated. The trade off EE-SE by using a multiobjective optimization problem to decrease transmit power has been analyzed. The EE and SE based on constraint maximum transmit power allocation and a number of antennas by computing the first derivative of transmit power to maximize the trade-off energy efficiency and spectral efficiency has been improved. From the simulation results, the optimum trade-off between EE and SE can be obtained based on the first derivative by selecting the optimal antennas with a low cost of transmit power. Therefore, based on an optimal optimization problem is flexible to make trade-offs between EE-SE for distinct preferences", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Engineering", "Mathematics"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-05-22", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2105.10722"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2087062609", "name": "A.
