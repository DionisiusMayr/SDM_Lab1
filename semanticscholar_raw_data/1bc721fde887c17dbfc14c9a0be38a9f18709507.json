To this end, we have developed a distributed memory solution that supports human-in-the-loop processing. Our solution embraces a number of design principles to offer high-performance, scalability and efficiency: (i) fast parallel processing - we adopt a vertex parallel computation model; (ii) aggressive search space reduction - using lightweight routines, we identify and prune away the non-matching part of the graph early; (iii) redundant work elimination - a revised query is likely to share label(s) and/or substructure(s) with its predecessor(s); therefore, whenever possible, we avoid redundant computation by reusing (partial) match information from earlier searches. Our preliminary evaluation highlights the effectiveness of the proposed approach: using a 257 billion edge real-world webgraph, on a 128 node (4,608 cores) deployment, we demonstrate the advantage of our technique over a naive approach (that uses an exact matching solution to independently search the original query and each of its revisions).", "venue": "GRADES-NDA@SIGMOD", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2020-06-14", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 3rd Joint International Workshop on Graph Data Management Experiences & Systems (GRADES) and Network Data Analytics (NDA)"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "35885602", "name": "Tahsin Reza"}, {"authorId": "1747805", "name": "M.
