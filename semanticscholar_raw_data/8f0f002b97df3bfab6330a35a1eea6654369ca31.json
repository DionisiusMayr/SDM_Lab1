Med2020 WinRecs abstraction software is used to abstract data based on dictionaries and data standards, accordingly. Figure 6. The main components of our Healthcare Big Data Analytics (HBDA) platform that were envisioned by stakeholders and derived from research team. There are numerous reasons why the BDA platform did not use real patient data. Firstly, the process of Ethics and Research Capacity at VIHA for approval for the entire patient data of the hospital system is not possible without existing system and total security/privacy testing. Secondly, it is not possible to piece together summarized data specific to health outcomes because this data has already been summarized and no benefit to VIHA, and, therefore, Ethics will not approve. Thirdly, in a real setting the data will have to be moved or migrated off of the production architecture to avoid using and consuming network resources in use in the hospital. Fourthly, real data in the data warehouse at VIHA will require several months to review and develop the solution to use big data technologies, which is not available.
