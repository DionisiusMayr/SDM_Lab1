But soon, we may have too much of it to store, process, and analyze in a timely and cost-effective manner. We take the position that approximate storage systems have a role to play in alleviating this problem. The paper is intended to generate discussion on the merits and pit-falls of data approximation, its applicability, and lack thereof, to a variety of learning algorithms, and its broader appeal to AI. Tackling the challenges of large-scale data analysis requires not only expertise in systems, but also in machine learning, statistics, and algorithms. The paper borrows from the lessons the authors learnt in building SummaryStore [4], an approximate storage system capable of storing large streams of time\u2013series data ( \u223c 1 petabyte on a single node), while preserving high degrees of accuracy and real-time querying at unprecedented cost savings.", "venue": "", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2132812674", "name": "Nitin Agrawal"}, {"authorId": "2285998669", "name": "Samsung Research"}, {"authorId": "3002190", "name": "Ashish Vulimiri"}], "citations": []}
