The k-means clustering method and two-step clustering method in the cluster analysis methods are mainly used in the research, and the standard classification system is established according to the working-hour characteristics of the mold products. The research results show that when the clustering threshold is 2, the cluster similarity is 0.984, 0.984, 1.002, 0.985, and 1.002 in turn. At the same time, the BIC change data of the cluster number 2 are -557.453, 76.952, and 204.564 respectively. It can be seen that when the clustering threshold and cluster number are 2, the clustering effect is the best. Finally, the number of the first-level categories is 7, and the number of the second-level categories is 12. It can be seen that the method of research and design can help manufacturers effectively conduct the differentiated classification of working hours and standardize working hours and costs in the production process of differentiated products.", "venue": "Conference on Machine Learning and Computer Application", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-05-25", "journal": {"pages": "126364J - 126364J-12", "volume": "12636"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2140177424", "name": "Lan Tu"}, {"authorId": "2186871284", "name": "Xiaorong Ye"}], "citations": []}
