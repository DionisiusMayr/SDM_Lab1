However, the preponderance of academic analysis on social media websites has focused on hate speech and misinformation. This paper focuses on analyzing moral judgements rendered on social media by capturing the moral judgements that are passed in the subreddit /r/AmITheAsshole on Reddit. Using the labels associated with each judgement we train a classifier that can take a comment and determine whether it judges the user who made the original post to have positive or negative moral valence. Then, we use this classifier to investigate an assortment of website traits surrounding moral judgements in ten other subreddits, including where negative moral users like to post and their posting patterns. Our findings also indicate that posts that are judged in a positive manner will score higher.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-01-19", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2101.07664"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1976148974", "name": "Nicholas Botzer"}, {"authorId": "10241472", "name": "Shawn Gu"}, {"authorId": "1714166", "name": "Tim Weninger"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "267bd1797fbb4b09ce3c99dc0eb1fec1852f1454", "title": "AITA Generating Moral Judgements of the Crowd with Reasoning"}, {"paperId": "e32b9750e00db3b05cb2ec65e45ac6476b44f6e4", "title": "Has It All Been Solved?
