Such massive data must be handled efficiently to disseminate knowledge. Computational advancements in information technology present feasible analytical solutions to process such data. In this context, the paper is an attempt to highlight the influence of big data in bioinformatics. Some of the concepts emphasised are definition of big data; architectural platforms supporting data analytics; followed by the application of above-mentioned analytical techniques towards complex problems in bioinformatics. The challenges and future prospects of big data analytics in bioinformatics are briefly discussed. This paper provides a comprehensive summary of several data analytical techniques available for bioinformatics researchers and computer scientists.", "venue": "International Journal of Bioinformatics Research and Applications", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2018-01-11", "journal": {"name": "Int.
