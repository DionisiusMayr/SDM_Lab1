In the proposed method, Bat Algorithm is employed as a popular optimization method and Artificial Neural Network is also utilized as a powerful mathematic method in mapping nonlinear relationship among model variables for the purpose of electric daily load prediction. Additionally, in order to improve the performance of the bat algorithm with regards to avoiding tapping into the local optimal and increasing the convergence speed, some modification has performed in bat algorithm which is called as SAMBA. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method has superiority performance in comparison with other traditional machine learning algorithms", "venue": "", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2017-12-19", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Computer Applications Technology and Research", "pages": "467-472", "volume": "6"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2082698054", "name": "Eduardo Capra"}, {"authorId": "2061013404", "name": "Hugo Ribeiro"}], "citations": []}
