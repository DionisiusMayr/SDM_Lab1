Consistency and consensus are two critical topics in group decision making (GDM) with preference relations. This paper uses the additively consistent concept for linguistic fuzzy preference relations (LFPRs) to give an additive consistency definition for HFLPRs. To judge the additive consistency of HFLPRs, 0\u20101 mixed programming models (0\u20101\u2010MPMs) are constructed. Meanwhile, additive\u2010consistency\u2010based 0\u20101\u2010MPMs to ascertain missing values in incomplete HFLPRs are established. Following the consistent probability of LFPRs, an algorithm to calculate the linguistic priority weighting vector is presented. In consideration of the consensus of GDM, a consistency\u2010probability\u2010distance\u2010measure\u2010based consensus index is defined, and an interactive improving consensus method is provided. Finally, a method for GDM with HFLPRs is offered that can address incomplete and inconsistent cases. Meanwhile, numerical examples are offered, and comparative analysis is made.", "venue": "Expert Syst. J. Knowl.
