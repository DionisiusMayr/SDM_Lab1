The need is for an effective and scalable intrusion detection system (IDS) to address these potential damages that come with the growth of these networks. A great deal of contemporary research on near real-time IDS focuses on applying machine learning classifiers to labeled network intrusion datasets, but these datasets need be relevant pertaining to the currency of the network intrusions. This paper focuses on a newly created dataset, UWF-ZeekData22, that analyzes data from Zeek\u2019s Connection Logs collected using Security Onion 2 network security monitor and labelled using the MITRE ATT&CK framework TTPs. Due to the volume of data, Spark, in the big data framework, was used to run many of the well-known classifiers (na\u00efve Bayes, random forest, decision tree, support vector classifier, gradient boosted trees, and logistic regression) to classify the reconnaissance and discovery tactics from this dataset. In addition to looking at the performance of these classifiers using Spark, scalability and response time were also analyzed.", "venue": "Italian National Conference on Sensors", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-10-01", "journal": {"name": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "volume": "22"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2016543", "name": "S.
