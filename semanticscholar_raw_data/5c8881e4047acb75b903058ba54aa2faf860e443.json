But its fault state operation is hard to analyze due to the flexibility of power flow and breaker configuration. This paper proposes a novel method to analyze the fault state operation of ring topology. First, a simplified linear power flow model is derived to describe power flow distribution. Then, the coupling constraints between the branches are constructed to describe the branch breaking caused by the fault. Finally, an operation optimization model is built to reach the best topology and minimum power shedding. The proposed method is tested with cases of complex ring topology, and the results show the effectiveness of the approach and the accuracy of the power flow model.", "venue": "2021 IEEE 5th Conference on Energy Internet and Energy System Integration (EI2)", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2021-10-22", "journal": {"name": "2021 IEEE 5th Conference on Energy Internet and Energy System Integration (EI2)", "pages": "119-124"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2118640249", "name": "Bangyan Wang"}, {"authorId": "48630786", "name": "Xiuli Wang"}, {"authorId": "2105730120", "name": "Zhenzi Song"}, {"authorId": "2156555093", "name": "Likai Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2118511651", "name": "Shuai Wang"}, {"authorId": "150067640", "name": "Chaoshan Xin"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "66e34c283a13ebfe83234ce3233e5bd2542393f2", "title": "Optimal control of offshore wind farm collector systems during outages"}]}
