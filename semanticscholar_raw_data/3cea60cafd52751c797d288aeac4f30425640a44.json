There are many commercial tools to give the higher accuracy. Here, our main aim is to cover the survey on abnormality detection in log analysis. This paper provides information which give the knowledge about tools for log analysis like ELK Stack tool as well as different scenarios where to use log analysis. ELK stack is combination of Elasticsearch which accepts the raw data to form different indexes, Logstash which use to collect the logs and Kibana is used for visualization purpose.", "venue": "", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2019-11-06", "journal": {"name": "EngRN: Computer Engineering (Topic)"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2127046480", "name": "Pranita P.
