The real disadvantage of sequence of gene information is the \u201cscourge of dimensionality issue\u201d; this frustrates the meaningful data of dataset and, what is more, prompts computational unsteadiness. Accordingly, choosing pertinent qualities is a basic in microarray information investigation. The majority of the existing plans utilize a two\u2010stage form: selection of features/extraction pursued by order. In this paper, a factual test, ie, forward selection depending upon map reduce, is suggested to choose the significant highlights. Subsequently, the selection of relevant features, ie, linear\u2010based Support Vector Machine (SVM) using map reduce based classifier, is likewise suggested to order the microarray information. These calculations are effectively executed on Hadoop system, and relative investigation is finished utilizing different datasets.", "venue": "Concurrency and Computation", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2019-08-22", "journal": {"name": "Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience", "volume": "34"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "81419698", "name": "M.
