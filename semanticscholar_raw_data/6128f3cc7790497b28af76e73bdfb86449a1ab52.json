Traditional independent computer systems can no longer meet people's needs in terms of functionality and performance. Distributed systems are systems where multiple computer systems are connected through a network and are becoming increasingly common. In the field of databases, distributed database systems have become an important research field. Distributed database systems are becoming increasingly popular because they meet the needs of current information system applications and meet the popular management ideas and methods in today's business organizations. At the same time, the industry has also begun to actively research and develop distributed database systems. In distributed databases, data redundancy is achieved by copying the same data block to multiple nodes for application and security reasons. If the database platform of a distributed system is not necessarily the same on all nodes, the problem to be solved is how to maintain data consistency with minimal duplication throughout the entire database system.", "venue": "Academic Journal of Computing &amp; Information Science", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "Academic Journal of Computing &amp; Information Science"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2117180974", "name": "Ting Chen"}, {"authorId": "2231789497", "name": "Haiyun Wang"}], "citations": []}
