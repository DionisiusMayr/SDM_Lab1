To this aim, many different structures have been proposed in the literature, mainly targeting the reduction in the costs introduced by the Multiply and Accumulate (MAC) primitive. In this work, a DNN layer based on the novel Sum and Max (SAM) paradigm is proposed. It does not require either the use of multiplications or the insertion of complex non-linear operations. Furthermore, it is especially prone to aggressive pruning, thus needing a very low number of parameters to work. The layer is tested on a simple classification task and its cost is compared with a classic DNN layer with equivalent accuracy based on the MAC primitive, in order to assess the reduction of resources that the use of this new structure could introduce.", "venue": "International Symposium on Circuits and Systems", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-05-28", "journal": {"name": "2022 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)", "pages": "712-716"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "151438227", "name": "Luciano Prono"}, {"authorId": "1685605", "name": "Mauro Mangia"}, {"authorId": "1827025", "name": "F.
