Specifically, prior research repeatedly indicates that decision-makers often refuse to adopt the data-driven, system-generated advice in their working procedures. In this paper, we address these acceptance issues by studying how PdM implementation changes the nature of decision-makers\u2019 work and how these changes affect their acceptance of PdM systems. We build on the human-centric Smith-Carayon Work System model to synthesise literature from research areas where system acceptance has been explored in more detail. Consequently, we expand the maintenance literature by investigating the human-, task-, and organisational characteristics of PdM implementation. Following the literature review, we distil ten propositions regarding decision-making behaviour in PdM settings. Next, we verify each proposition\u2019s relevance through in-depth interviews with experts from both academia and industry. Based on the propositions and interviews, we identify four factors that facilitate PdM adoption: trust between decision-maker and model (maker), control in the decision-making process, availability of sufficient cognitive resources, and proper organisational allocation of decision-making. Our results contribute to a fundamental understanding of acceptance behaviour in a PdM context and provide recommendations to increase the effectiveness of PdM implementations.", "venue": "International Journal of Production Research", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-12-15", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Production Research", "pages": "7846 - 7865", "volume": "61"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2256518165", "name": "Bas van Oudenhoven"}, {"authorId": "2256516752", "name": "P.
