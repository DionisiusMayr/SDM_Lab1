Monitoring of events happening at different points in a distributed environment can detect the occurrence of events that indicates significant error conditions. We use Modular Timing Diagrams (MTD) as a specification language to describe these error conditions. MTDs are a component-oriented and compositional notation. We take advantage of these features of MTDs and point out that, in many cases, a global MTD specification describing behaviors of several system components can be efficiently decomposed into a set of sub-specifications. Each of the sub-specifications describes a local monitor that is specific to the component on which the monitor is intended to run. We illustrate the compositional nature of MTDs in describing several network monitoring conditions related to network security.", "venue": "", "year": 2015, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2015-07-15", "journal": {"name": "", "volume": ""}, "authors": [{"authorId": "34926016", "name": "P.
