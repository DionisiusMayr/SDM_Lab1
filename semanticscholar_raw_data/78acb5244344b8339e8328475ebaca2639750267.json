This paper describes the implementation of a micro video big data visualization system in detail, which has four steps: determine the visualization objective, choose data based on the objective, display various charts using Highcharts, and design the details of the charts. Some pictures of the visualization results in this system are inserted to help the comprehension. Then some key technologies used in this system are listed to show the specific technical solution.", "venue": "International Conference on Computer and Information Application", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2017-09-01", "journal": {"name": "2017 2nd IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Applications (ICCIA)", "pages": "1-5"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "50394552", "name": "Rui Lu"}, {"authorId": "1864994", "name": "Sanxing Cao"}], "citations": []}
