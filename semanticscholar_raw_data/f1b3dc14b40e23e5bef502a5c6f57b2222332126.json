It usually comes at the cost of finding a trade-off between data throughput and the cost of expressive inferences. StriderR proposes such a trade-off and combines a scalable RDF stream processing engine with an efficient reasoning system. The main reasoning tasks are based on a query rewriting approach for SPARQL that benefits from an intelligent encoding of an extension of the RDFS (i.e., RDFS with owl:sameAs) ontology elements. StriderR runs in production at a major international water management company to detect anomalies from sensor streams. The system is evaluated along different dimensions and over multiple datasets to emphasize its performance.", "venue": "2017 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2017-12-01", "journal": {"name": "2017 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "pages": "3358-3367"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3464627", "name": "Xiangnan Ren"}, {"authorId": "2141773", "name": "Olivier Cur\u00e9"}, {"authorId": "3045686", "name": "Hubert Naacke"}, {"authorId": "48790972", "name": "J.
