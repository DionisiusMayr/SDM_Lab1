It is urgent to conduct in-depth and systematic research on the planning methods of China\u2019s rural networked roads. A road network model oriented to rural road network planning is proposed. First, the traffic demand is predicted, and then remote sensing technology and computer technology are used to evaluate the technical performance of the rural road network. The experimental results show that the comprehensive evaluation index value is 0.8 by combining the weight of each index, and the planning scheme is comprehensively evaluated. The evaluation results show that the program better supports the local social and economic development.", "venue": "Journal of Advanced Transportation", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-03-12", "journal": {"name": "Journal of Advanced Transportation"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "103709757", "name": "Minqing Zhu"}, {"authorId": "2274070857", "name": "Zi Wang"}, {"authorId": "3162477", "name": "Hongjun Cui"}, {"authorId": "48700512", "name": "Shengyong Yao"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "1314a20fe1286a3bae4e8e173ed16e17028d1235", "title": "A Model Assembly Approach of Planning Urban\u2013Rural Transportation Network: A Case Study of Jiangxia District, Wuhan, China"}]}
