Further, with an expeditious blooming of emerging applications such as social media applications, semantic Web, and bioinformatics applications, data heterogeneity is increasing swiftly. Accordingly, a variety of data needs to be executed with less high accuracy and less. However, effective data analysis and processing of large - scale data are compelling which is considered a critical challenge in the current scenario. To overcome these issues, various techniques have been developed and executed but still, it is significant to improve in accuracy. The current study proposed a hybrid technique of BiLSTM - SAE has been proposed for business big data analytics. Bidirectional LSTM is considered as an advanced version of the conventional LSTM approach. The performance comparison of the proposed method BiLSTM - SAE with existing Random forest - RF has been processed. The final result reported that the proposed method BiLSTM - SAE had been procured with better accuracy of 0.836. Moreover, the training and validation accuracy and loss on different performance metrics have been studied and conducted in the research.", "venue": "", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "47270940", "name": "Shubhashish Goswami"}], "citations": []}
