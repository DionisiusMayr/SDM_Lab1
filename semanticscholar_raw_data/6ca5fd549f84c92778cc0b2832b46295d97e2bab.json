In this paper, we study how to schedule jobs over such interchangeable resources - each with a different rate of computation - to optimize performance while providing fairness among users in a shared cluster. We demonstrate theoretically and empirically that existing solutions and their straightforward modifications perform poorly in the presence of interchangeable resources, which motivates the design and implementation of AlloX. At its core, AlloX transforms the scheduling problem into a min-cost bipartite matching problem and provides dynamic fair allocation over time. We theoretically prove its optimality in an ideal, offline setting and show empirically that it works well in the online scenario by incorporating with Kubernetes. Evaluations on a small-scale CPU-GPU hybrid cluster and large-scale simulations highlight that AlloX can reduce the average job completion time significantly (by up to 95% when the system load is high) while providing fairness and preventing starvation.", "venue": "European Conference on Computer Systems", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2020-04-15", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the Fifteenth European Conference on Computer Systems"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2171919", "name": "T.
