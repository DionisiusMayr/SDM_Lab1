In this paper, a dynamic Bayesian network is built as a load forecasting model of transformer areas. The parallel computing platform Apache Spark is used to calculate the parameters of the model based on large volume of transformers' historical data in parallel. Meanwhile, the Pregel computing model is used to parallelize the forward backward algorithm to realize the forecasting tasks. The experimental results show that the proposed transformer areas load forecasting technology based on distributed graph computing has high prediction accuracy and fast calculation speed.", "venue": "China International Conference on Electricity Distribution", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2018-09-01", "journal": {"name": "2018 China International Conference on Electricity Distribution (CICED)", "pages": "2437-2441"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2066158997", "name": "Qi Hui"}, {"authorId": "10797864", "name": "Tang Haibo"}, {"authorId": "2072969606", "name": "Feng Wei"}, {"authorId": "1391375252", "name": "Wen Beibei"}, {"authorId": "2105608171", "name": "Wu Qian"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "07e9bccdd92fe9cc139fd2d2306fa669648e2efd", "title": "Master Plan for Electricity Distribution Networks Based on Micro-Spatial Projection of Energy Demand"}]}
