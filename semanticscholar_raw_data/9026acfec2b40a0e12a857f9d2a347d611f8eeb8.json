Complexity arises from several aspects of the Big Data life cycle, such as gathering data, storing them onto cloud servers, cleaning and integrating the data, a process involving the last advances in ontologies, such as Extensible Markup Language (XML) and Resource Description Framework (RDF), and the application of machine learning methods to carry out classifications, predictions, and visualizations. In this review, the state of the art of all the aforementioned aspects of Big Data in the context of the Internet of Things is exposed. The most novel technologies in machine learning, deep learning, and data mining on Big Data are discussed as well. Finally, we also point the reader to the state-of-the-art literature for further in-depth studies, and we present the major trends for the future.", "venue": "Complex", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2019-02-03", "journal": {"name": "Complex.", "pages": "4592902:1-4592902:12", "volume": "2019"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "146493028", "name": "David Gil"}, {"authorId": "34893565", "name": "Magnus Johnsson"}, {"authorId": "3144590", "name": "H.
