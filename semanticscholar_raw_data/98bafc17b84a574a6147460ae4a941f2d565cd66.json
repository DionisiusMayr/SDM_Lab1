Our approach consists of a specialisation of Lambda architecture and it is inspired by some aspects of Kappa architecture. As a proof of this solution, we show a prototype developed following it and a comparison of the three architecture quality models. Finally, we highlight the differences between the proposed architecture and similar ones and draw some future lines following the present approach.", "venue": "Behavior and Information Technology", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2019-05-24", "journal": {"name": "Behaviour & Information Technology", "pages": "950 - 958", "volume": "38"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1409722166", "name": "Herminio Garc\u00eda-Gonz\u00e1lez"}, {"authorId": "1400380328", "name": "Daniel Fern\u00e1ndez-\u00c1lvarez"}, {"authorId": "1729679", "name": "Jose Emilio Labra Gayo"}, {"authorId": "1698723", "name": "P.
