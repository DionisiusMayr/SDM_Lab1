To detect changes in integrated pipelines and professional pipelines, the matching of same-name spatial objects is critical. Existing algorithms used for vector network matching were analyzed to develop an improved matching algorithm that can adapt to underground pipeline networks. Our algorithm improves the holistic matching of pipeline strokes, and also a partial matching algorithm is provided. In this study, appropriate geometric measures were selected to calculate the geometric similarity between pipeline strokes in their holistic matching. Existing methods for evaluating similarities in spatial scene structures in partial underground pipeline networks were improved. A method of partial matching of strokes was additionally investigated, and it compensates for the deficiencies of holistic stroke matching. Experiments showed that the matching performance was good, and the operation efficiency was high.", "venue": "ISPRS Int. J.
