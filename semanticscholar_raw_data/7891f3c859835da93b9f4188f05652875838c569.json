For these reasons, it is necessary to provide interoperability between JSON and other NoSQL formats. There are several approaches that aims to translate between different NoSQL formats, however, most of them attempt to be generic and do not focus on JSON. They aim on providing an abstract and generic representation capturing all the data models constructs and to provide wrapper-like structures, or to develop pairs of translators. In this paper, we present an approach that uses the JSON data model as driving format for interoperability with distinct NoSQL data models. We take advantage of its nested textual structure to apply the pull-parser programming model to process it and to develop translators between JSON and a set of representative NoSQL formats. We focus on the JSON extraction and on the development and application of the data transformations. We validate our approach through an implementation handling a large number of data representation strategies.", "venue": "International Conference on Enterprise Information Systems", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2018-05-06", "journal": {"pages": "95-102"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "40993467", "name": "Leandro Pulgatti"}, {"authorId": "1822135", "name": "Marcos Didonet Del Fabro"}], "citations": []}
