The rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) systems worldwide has increased network security challenges created by malicious third parties. Thus, reliable intrusion detection and network forensics systems that consider security concerns and IoT systems limitations are essential to protect such systems. IoT botnet attacks are one of the significant threats to enterprises and individuals. Thus, this paper proposed an economic deep learning-based model for detecting IoT botnet attacks along with different types of attacks. The proposed model achieved higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art detection models using a smaller implementation budget and accelerating the training and detecting processes.", "venue": "2023 IEEE World AI IoT Congress (AIIoT)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-02-03", "journal": {"name": "2023 IEEE World AI IoT Congress (AIIoT)", "pages": "0134-0142"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3101271", "name": "Nelly Elsayed"}, {"authorId": "50421897", "name": "Zag ElSayed"}, {"authorId": "2149930651", "name": "Magdy A.
