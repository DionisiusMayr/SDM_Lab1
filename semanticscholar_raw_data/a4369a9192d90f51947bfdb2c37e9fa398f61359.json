However, there is currently no open platform for implementing video processing of inland waterway vessels. According to the characteristics of large video and video formats of inland vessel, the paper proposes to build a standard video library for inland vessel and establish a video processing platform for inland vessels based on Hadoop, which adopts B/S architecture, with Html, CSS and JavaScript as front desk technology, JSP, Servlet and JavaBean as background processing technology, and realizes the function of online processing video. Compared with the traditional stand-alone mode, HDFS provides a parallel computing model, Map Reduce, and a distributed file system called Hadoop. It realizes the parallel processing of inland river vessel video processing, improves the speed of inland river vessel video tracking and detection, and shortens the running time of the algorithm.", "venue": "International Conference on Industrial Informatics", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2017-12-01", "journal": {"name": "2017 International Conference on Industrial Informatics - Computing Technology, Intelligent Technology, Industrial Information Integration (ICIICII)", "pages": "29-32"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2119413776", "name": "Lei Jia"}, {"authorId": "48605132", "name": "Jianming Guo"}, {"authorId": "153874404", "name": "Qing Liu"}], "citations": []}
