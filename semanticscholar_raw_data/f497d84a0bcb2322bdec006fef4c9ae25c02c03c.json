Many different methods are presented in recent times in this field to gain benefits. Various types of microphone arrays serve the purpose of sensing the incoming sound. This paper presents an overview of the importance of using sound localization in different applications along with the use and limitations of ad-hoc microphones over other microphones. In order to overcome these limitations certain approaches are also presented. Detailed explanation of some of the existing methods that are used for sound localization using microphone arrays in the recent literature is given. Existing methods are studied in a comparative fashion along with the factors that influence the choice of one method over the others. This review is done in order to form a basis for choosing the best fit method for our use.", "venue": "Energies", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2021-06-29", "journal": {"name": "Energies"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2120492598", "name": "Muhammad Usman Liaquat"}, {"authorId": "71940750", "name": "Hafiz Suliman Munawar"}, {"authorId": "2148759458", "name": "Amna Rahman"}, {"authorId": "65883646", "name": "Zakria Qadir"}, {"authorId": "3089801", "name": "A.
