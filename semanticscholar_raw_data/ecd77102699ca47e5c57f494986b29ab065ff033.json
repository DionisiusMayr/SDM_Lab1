Its real magnitude presents very important regional differences, which are appreciable in the number of infected and victims in the different countries. The outbreak of the pandemic and the ignorance of the virus mean that, even today, there are many unknowns about essential aspects related to it. In this sense, geographic knowledge can help answer many questions from the territorial analysis of the data. The objective of this article will be to analyze the behavior of the coronavirus pandemic within the Spanish region of Galicia. The authors of this study propose a multiscale analysis that allows deciphering the most common propagation patterns. For this, we have high spatial resolution data that has been provided by the competent authority under confidentiality. The results of this work allow us to represent and interpret the territorial impact of the pandemic, understanding its behavior as far as possible, allowing future dynamics to be predicted.", "venue": "Bolet\u00edn de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Ge\u00f3grafos Espa\u00f1oles", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2021-11-22", "journal": {"name": "Bolet\u00edn de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Ge\u00f3grafos Espa\u00f1oles"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2141711084", "name": "\u00c1ngel Miramontes Carballada"}, {"authorId": "1409505343", "name": "J.
