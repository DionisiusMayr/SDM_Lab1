Putting IoT objects on the wheel has created a new technology called the Internet of Vehicle (IoV). The massive progress in communication and computing concepts brought the IoV to real implementation. The IoV is the advanced version of Vehicular Ad hoc Network (VANET), mainly designed to provide safe driving. Although the number of vehicles connected to the IoV keeps growing, there are various challenges and opportunities of the IoV technology that are still not clear. In this paper, several research papers related to the IoV were examined to identify and categorize the existing challenges of implementing and employing IoV in urban cities. Furthermore, this work outlines the IoV technical limitations that must be addressed. Moreover, various existing and future solutions that tackle the identified challenges were briefly discussed.", "venue": "Automation, Control, and Information Technology", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2020-11-28", "journal": {"name": "2020 21st International Arab Conference on Information Technology (ACIT)", "pages": "1-10"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1825783138", "name": "Jawaher Abdulwahab Fadhil"}, {"authorId": "9076102", "name": "Q.
