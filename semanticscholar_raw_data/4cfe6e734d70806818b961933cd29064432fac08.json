The goal of these campaigns is often to polarize and steer online discussion towards certain strategic narratives. There has been little work, however, on understanding the effect that these in\ufb02uence campaigns have on online discourse, although this is key to assessing their effectiveness and devising ef\ufb01cient countermeasures. In this paper, we study the effect that troll accounts have on online discussions on Reddit. We look at whether these accounts are successful in generating polarized discussions, by comparing the toxicity of comments in threads started by troll accounts compared to general Reddit threads. Our results show that state-sponsored troll accounts on Reddit produce threads that attract more toxic comments than other posts on the same subreddit.", "venue": "ICWSM Workshops", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2113416988", "name": "Mohammad Hammas Saeed"}, {"authorId": "144728530", "name": "Jeremy Blackburn"}, {"authorId": "2350947", "name": "G.
