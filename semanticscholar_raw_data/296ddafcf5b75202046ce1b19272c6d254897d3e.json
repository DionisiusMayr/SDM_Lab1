The root cause of these limitations is the \u201cfunction-centric\u201d model: a function is a \ufb01xed-size box that is allocated, executed, and terminated as an inseparable unit. This unit is pre-de\ufb01ned by the cloud provider and cannot properly capture user needs. We propose a \u201cresource-centric\u201d model for serverless computing, which adapts the underlying provider serverless systems to follow applications\u2019 natural resource needs. To achieve this vision, we built Scad based on two ideas: dis-aggregating a serverless application based on its resource features and aggregating disaggregated units for better performance. Our results show that Scad solves various resource-related issues of today\u2019s serverless computing, while retaining or even improving its performance.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2206.13444"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2116391286", "name": "Zhiyuan Guo"}, {"authorId": "51170039", "name": "Zachary Blanco"}, {"authorId": "2909388", "name": "Mohammad Shahrad"}, {"authorId": "74818938", "name": "Zeru Wei"}, {"authorId": "2057587374", "name": "Bili Dong"}, {"authorId": "2173718976", "name": "Jinmou Li"}, {"authorId": "2173752567", "name": "Ishaan Pota"}, {"authorId": "70180182", "name": "Harry Xu"}, {"authorId": "2108361757", "name": "Yiying Zhang"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "6966b223fc62bd8205880f385b198969155b61af", "title": "Limitless FaaS: Overcoming serverless functions execution time limits with invoke driven architecture and memory checkpoints"}, {"paperId": "4aef67cc481b5ab9592b79db393ea019fbdd5ff7", "title": "Parrotfish: Parametric Regression for Optimizing Serverless Functions"}, {"paperId": "a127f5f5d041bfad1cba2c0a6599732c2835015a", "title": "Persistent Memory-Aware Scheduling for Serverless Workloads"}, {"paperId": "8219b7fd58cd6786c2864cbdb5cae12aedea43c4", "title": "Towards a fully disaggregated and programmable data center"}, {"paperId": "18a3e346e2045ff96fc15c33aafcd83cd4d2779a", "title": "No Provisioned Concurrency: Fast RDMA-codesigned Remote Fork for Serverless Computing"}, {"paperId": "97e0bfa95f9a2910793ddcda062433985b94812e", "title": "rFaaS: Enabling High Performance Serverless with RDMA and Leases"}, {"paperId": "06e516f1f6656cea9085a24f7fa1168a076fdcc6", "title": "Process-as-a-Service: FaaSt Stateful Computing with Optimized Data Planes"}, {"paperId": "83034a110336587f0c181d49b6cbb6e101af4fbd", "title": "This paper is included in the Proceedings of the 21st USENIX Conference on File and Storage Technologies."}]}
