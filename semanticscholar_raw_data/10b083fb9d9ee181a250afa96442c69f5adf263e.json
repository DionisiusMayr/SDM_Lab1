Some studies have begun to focus on the relationship between entrepreneurs\u2019 struggle and their mental health. However, there is little understanding of the issues that lead to entrepreneurial struggle. This research explores different areas in which entrepreneurs struggle in their venture-building process. Using a corpus of 10,150 semi-anonymous Reddit posts, this study identifies the areas of entrepreneurial struggle in the venture-building process. A total of 691 posts that contained struggle-related words were collected from the dataset. After applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, four areas of entrepreneurial struggle were found: product concept and business model; resources; market entry strategy and entry timing; and customer care, service, and communication. The findings of this study indicate that entrepreneurs should be prepared to deal with challenges in these areas in their entrepreneurial endeavors.", "venue": "International Journal of High School Research", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-08-31", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of High School Research"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2244141534", "name": "Peter J.
