The problem is constructed as a binary classification task on whether the caseload change exceeds a threshold or not. We find that including Reddit features, alongside other informative resources, improves the models' performance in predicting COVID-19 cases. On top of this, we show that exclusive use of Reddit features can act as a strong alternative data source for predicting a short-term rise in caseload due to its strong performance and the fact that it is readily available and updates instantaneously. \u00a9 2021 for this paper by its authors.", "venue": "Swiss Text Analytics Conference", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "2021 Swiss Text Analytics Conference, SwissText 2021", "volume": "2957"}, "authors": [{"authorId": null, "name": "Felix Drinkall"}, {"authorId": "1970864", "name": "J.
