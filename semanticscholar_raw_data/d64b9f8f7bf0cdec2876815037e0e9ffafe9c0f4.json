For such complex and dynamic needs, we argue for the benefits of workflows implemented as computer programs, using workflow tools implemented as programming libraries. Furthermore, by using flow-based programming principles, a declarative while programmatic API can be presented, while still hiding a lot of low-level details under the hood. Being able to provide workflows in the form of compiled executable files has benefits both for the ease of deployment and future reproducibility. Workflow tool implementations are at risk for bit rot or incompatible changes well before the mainstream programming languages -or processor architectures -are.", "venue": "Computing in science & engineering (Print)", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2019-05-01", "journal": {"name": "Computing in Science & Engineering", "pages": "109-113", "volume": "21"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3124236", "name": "Samuel Lampa"}, {"authorId": "5966309", "name": "Martin Dahl\u00f6"}, {"authorId": "3336882", "name": "Jonathan Alvarsson"}, {"authorId": "1776762", "name": "O.
