Despite their advantages in terms of fine-grained scalability and modular development, these applications are subject to suboptimal performance, resource inefficiency, and high costs to a larger degree than previous simple serverless functions. We present Aquatope, a QoS-and-uncertainty-aware resource scheduler for end-to-end serverless workflows that takes into account the inherent uncertainty present in FaaS platforms, and im-provesperformancepredictabilityandresourceefficiency.Aquatope usesasetofscalableandvalidatedBayesianmodelstocreatepre-warmedcontainersaheadoffunctioninvocations,andtoallocate appropriateresourcesatfunctiongranularitytomeetacomplex workflow\u2019send-to-endQoS,whileminimizingresourcecost.Across adiversesetofanalyticsandinteractivemulti-stageserverlesswork-loads,Aquatopesignificantlyoutperformspriorsystems,reducing QoSviolationsby5 \u00d7 , and cost by 34% on average and up to 52% compared to other QoS-meeting methods.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-12-28", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2212.13882"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2112218361", "name": "Zhuangzhuang Zhou"}, {"authorId": "49890070", "name": "Yanqi Zhang"}, {"authorId": "3234334", "name": "Christina Delimitrou"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "6602a90aa14e17d8c12c267e5aee04f44b5ab88c", "title": "Il\u00favatar: A Fast Control Plane for Serverless Computing"}]}
