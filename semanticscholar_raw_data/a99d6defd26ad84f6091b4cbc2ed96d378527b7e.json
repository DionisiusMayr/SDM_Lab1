The data prediction and decision are to realize the comprehensive analysis and value mining. In this study, hierarchical learning behavior based on feature cluster is proposed. Based on the massive data in interactive learning environment, the descriptive model and learning algorithm suitable for feature clustering are designed, and sufficient experiments obtain the optimal performance indexes. The data analysis results are reliable. On this basis, the hierarchical learning behaviors based on feature clusters are visualized, the rules of different learning behaviors are summarized, then we propose the practical scheme of interactive cooperation. The hierarchical learning behaviors can be realized by feature clusters, which can effectively improve the modes of interactive cooperation, and help to improve the learning effectiveness.", "venue": "SAGE Open", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-04-01", "journal": {"name": "SAGE Open"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2118916490", "name": "Tianjiao Wang"}, {"authorId": "1807986", "name": "Xiaona Xia"}], "citations": []}
