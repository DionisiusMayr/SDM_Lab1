At the beginning of 2019, for most organizations, the main problems of a mainly technical nature were the updating of research plans for 2019, taking into account additional budget works opened for new laboratories. Inaccuracies in the coordination of labor costs, financing direct and indirect costs were identified. Taking into account the staff youth, the main risks for new laboratories are the fulfillment of indicators for the state task (articles in journals) and the provision of scientific staff salaries over 200% of the average salary in the region (attraction of additional extrabudgetary funds). Also, taking into account that employees with little experience were taken into new laboratories, it is quite difficult to apply a well-tested Personal Research Activity Rating tool for financial motivation, and other strategies are needed for \u201cthe cold start\u201d of new research laboratories in academic institutions. The options of scientific and organizational measures considered in the article are aimed at reducing the risks of the formation of new laboratories and transforming them into points of growth and exchange of best practices among other scientific and educational organizations.", "venue": "Administrative Consulting", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2019-05-01", "journal": {"name": "Administrative consulting"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "144719761", "name": "A.
