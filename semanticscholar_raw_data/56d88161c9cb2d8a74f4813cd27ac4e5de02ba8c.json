Due to structured data and computational memory, cloud storage systems are also independent of integrity computational and data security. As the size of the cloud information records are expanding in the general population and confidential cloud servers, it is hard to encode and translate the huge information because of document configuration and restricted respectability key size. The computational time and extra room of the ordinary quality based encryption and unscrambling models are high during the information honesty check and restricted information size. For strong data encryption and decryption, a hybrid variable-sized data integrity algorithm is implemented on heterogeneous cloud data files in this paper. For improved cloud data security, this work proposes an optimized attribute-based encryption and decryption procedure for large data files. On cloud heterogeneous data types, proposed framework outperforms conventional cloud security frameworks in terms of optimization, as demonstrated by the results of the experiments.", "venue": "", "year": null, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2261166007", "name": "Mohd Anwar Ali"}, {"authorId": "3462155", "name": "N.
