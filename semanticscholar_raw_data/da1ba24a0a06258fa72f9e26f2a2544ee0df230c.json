It uses a novel approach, the persistent distributed channels, based on the concept of Share memory by communicating, and inspired from Resilient distributed datasets of Apache Spark. The architecture of our proposed system is considered as near-metal platform for Big Data operations in order to enhance the speed of massive data processing.", "venue": "ICBDC", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-05-28", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Big Data and Computing"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "5895907", "name": "Noussair Fikri"}, {"authorId": "2623380", "name": "M.
