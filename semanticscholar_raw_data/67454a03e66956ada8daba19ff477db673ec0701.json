Understanding the characteristics that lead consumers to relate to CVs motivates researchers to conduct market analysis studies. The current research investigated the socio-demographic attributes that may contribute to the individual preferences for purchasing CVs. Researchers constructed a series of Alternative-Specific Mixed Logit models to examine the associations between individual preferences of respondents and their willingness to pay for CV features in their future vehicle. The results indicate that hours spent driving play a privileged role among sociodemographic characteristics and driving behavior attributes of respondents. People who drive longer hours tended to purchase CV features. Also, the factor of age had a noticeable effect as the results showed that older people are more likely to purchase CV features.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "71414085", "name": "A.
