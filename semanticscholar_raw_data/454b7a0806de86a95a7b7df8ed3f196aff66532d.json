This paper tries to answer this question. This paper analyzes ADAS and ML independently and then relate which ML technique is applicable to what ADAS component and why. The paper gives a good grasp of the current state-of-the-art. Sample works in supervised, unsupervised, deep and reinforcement learnings are presented; their strengths and rooms for improvements are also discussed. This forms part of the basics in understanding autonomous vehicle. This work is a contribution to the ongoing research in ML aimed at reducing road traffic accidents and fatalities, and the invocation of safe driving.", "venue": "International Conference on Advances in Computing and Communication Engineering", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2018-06-01", "journal": {"name": "2018 International Conference on Advances in Computing and Communication Engineering (ICACCE)", "pages": "235-242"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "51232340", "name": "A.
