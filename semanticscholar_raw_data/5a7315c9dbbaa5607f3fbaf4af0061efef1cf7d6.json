To steer terabits per second traf\ufb01c, traditional software LBs scale out with many expensive servers. Recent switch-accelerated LBs scale up ef\ufb01ciently, but fail to of\ufb02oad a massive number of concurrent \ufb02ows into limited on-chip SRAMs. This paper presents Tiara, a hardware architecture for stateful layer-4 LBs that aims to support a high traf\ufb01c rate (> 1 Tbps), a large number of concurrent \ufb02ows (> 10M), and many new connections per second (> 1M), without any assumption on traf\ufb01c patterns. The three-tier architecture of Tiara makes the best use of heterogeneous hardware for stateful LBs, including a programmable switch and FPGAs for the fast path and x86 servers for the slow path. The core idea of Tiara is to divide the LB fast path into a memory-intensive task ( real server selection ) and a throughput-intensive task ( packet encap/decap ), and map them into the most suitable hardware, respectively (i.e., map real server selection into FPGA with large high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and packet encap/decap into a high-throughput programmable switch). We have implemented a fully functional Tiara prototype, and experiments show that Tiara can achieve extremely high performance (1.6 Tbps throughput, 80M concurrent \ufb02ows, 1.8M new connections per second, and less than 4 us latency in the fast path) in", "venue": "Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"pages": "1345-1358"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1491239993", "name": "Chaoliang Zeng"}, {"authorId": "2016771", "name": "Layong Luo"}, {"authorId": "2110105111", "name": "Teng Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2117425339", "name": "Zilong Wang"}, {"authorId": "2114026055", "name": "Luyang Li"}, {"authorId": "2153819149", "name": "Wenchen Han"}, {"authorId": "2118768913", "name": "Nan Chen"}, {"authorId": "2166492366", "name": "Lebing Wan"}, {"authorId": "2175129737", "name": "Lichao Liu"}, {"authorId": "2112354789", "name": "Zhipeng Ding"}, {"authorId": "2130575", "name": "Xiongfei Geng"}, {"authorId": "145926664", "name": "T.
