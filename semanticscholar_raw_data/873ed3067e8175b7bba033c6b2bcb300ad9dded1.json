The rapid growth of IoT devices has led to a pressing need for robust security measures. Two promising approaches that can enhance IoT security are blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI). Blockchain can offer a decentralized and tamper-proof framework, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of IoT data. AI can analyze large volumes of real-time data and detect anomalies in response to security threats in the IoT ecosystem. This paper explores the potential of these technologies and how they complement each other to provide a secured IoT system. Our main argument is that combining blockchain with AI can provide a robust solution for securing IoT networks and safeguarding the privacy of IoT users. This survey paper aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the potential of these technologies for securing IoT networks and discuss the challenges and opportunities associated with their integration. It also provides a discussion on the current state of research on this topic and presents future research directions in this area.", "venue": "International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2138190645", "name": "Mohammed Tauseef"}, {"authorId": "3169998", "name": "Manjunath R.
