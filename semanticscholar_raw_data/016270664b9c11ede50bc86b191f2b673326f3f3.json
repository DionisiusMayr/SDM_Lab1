However, training novices in basic mid-air AR interactions remains challenging. To address this, we aimed to: (a) develop a robust metric to evaluate user performance across different AR interaction techniques and develop adaptation models to predict additional training requirements; (b) evaluate the adaptation models using a neuroergonomics approach. We conduct a two-phase study during which, novice participants perform simple AR interactions: poking and raycasting. In Phase-I, twenty-seven participants\u2019 data is used to identify a bi-variate performance metric based on median completion time and consistency. Unsupervised models are trained using this metric to classify participants as low/high performers. In Phase-II, we evaluate the models on twenty-one new participants and analyze the differences in performance, neural activity and heart-rate variability between low/high performers. Our study showcases the effectiveness of our models and further discusses the potential of integrating neuroergonomics for advanced AR-based training applications.", "venue": "International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-09-01", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Human\u2013Computer Interaction"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "8259651", "name": "S.
