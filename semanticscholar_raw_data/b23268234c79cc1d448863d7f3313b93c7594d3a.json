Various strategies and surveys have been proposed in this respect. These surveys include comprehensive analysis and classifications. However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, there is no survey concentrating on strategies designed for interconnected cloud systems. In this article, we provide an in\u2010depth analysis of existing data replication strategies in cloud systems, covering single and interconnected clouds. We also highlight data correlation\u2010aware strategies as well as their key steps. Furthermore, we examine the major strategies' features such as: ( i$$ i $$ ) addressed replication issues, ( ii$$ ii $$ ) orientation towards the provider and the consumer, ( iii$$ iii $$ ) consideration of the service level agreement, ( iv$$ iv $$ ) consideration of cost and economic aspects, and ( v$$ v $$ ) evaluation tools. Finally, we provide a performance analysis through extensive simulations of several replication strategies dedicated for single and interconnected clouds.", "venue": "Concurrency and Computation", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-05-02", "journal": {"name": "Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience", "volume": "35"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2904813", "name": "T.
