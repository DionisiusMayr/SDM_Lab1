Traditional methodologies for annotating datasets for NER models are challenged by high costs and variations in dataset quality. This research introduces a novel hybrid annotation approach that synergizes human effort with the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). This approach not only aims to ameliorate the noise inherent in manual annotations, such as omissions, thereby enhancing the performance of NER models, but also achieves this in a cost-effective manner. Additionally, by employing a label mixing strategy, it addresses the issue of class imbalance encountered in LLM-based annotations. Through an analysis across multiple datasets, this method has been consistently shown to provide superior performance compared to traditional annotation methods, even under constrained budget conditions. This study illuminates the potential of leveraging LLMs to improve dataset quality, introduces a novel technique to mitigate class imbalances, and demonstrates the feasibility of achieving high-performance NER in a cost-effective way.", "venue": "", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2024-03-30", "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2294566701", "name": "Yuji Naraki"}, {"authorId": "2262220480", "name": "Ryosuke Yamaki"}, {"authorId": "2294573240", "name": "Yoshikazu Ikeda"}, {"authorId": "2294570624", "name": "Takafumi Horie"}, {"authorId": "2262220909", "name": "Hiroki Naganuma"}], "citations": []}
