To improve GSES, a large number of approaches have been proposed in the past decades. However, few attempts have been made to systematically review and classify the literature in this field. The objective of this study is to afford a comprehensive review of the studies which aim to develop models and methods in helping enterprises to assess and select the right green suppliers. To achieve this goal, a total of 193 journal articles extracted from the Scopus database over the period of 2009 to 2020 were chosen and reviewed. These publications were classified into ten categories based on their adopted GSES models and analyzed concerning the evaluation criteria, criteria weighting methods, and performance evaluation methods. Moreover, a bibliometric analysis was conducted according to the frequency of supplier selection methods, citation number, publication year, journal, country, and application area. This study supports practitioners, managers, and researchers in effectively recognizing and applying the GSES models to enhance organizational competitiveness and provides an insight into its state of the art.", "venue": "Mathematical Problems in Engineering", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2020-07-15", "journal": {"name":
