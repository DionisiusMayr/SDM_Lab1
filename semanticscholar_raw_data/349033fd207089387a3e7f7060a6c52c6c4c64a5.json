Although the tasks associated with demand side management (DSM) are extremely complex, the use of large-scale data and the frequent requirement for near-real-time decisions mean that Artificial Intelligence (AI) has recently emerged as a key technology for enabling DSM. Optimization algorithm methods can be used to address a variety of problems, including selecting the optimal set of consumers to respond to, learning their attributes and preferences, dynamic pricing, device scheduling, and control, as well as determining the most effective way to incentive and reward participants in DR schemes fairly and effectively. The implementation optimization algorithm needs proper selection to mitigate the cost of energy consumption. Due to that reason, this paper outlines various challenges and opportunities in developing, utilizing, controlling, and scheduling the DR scheme\u2019s optimization algorithm. In addition, several issues in applications and advantages of optimization techniques in artificial intelligence approaches are discussed. The importance of implementing demand response mechanisms in developing countries is also presented. In addition, the status of demand response optimization in demand-side management solutions is also illustrated congruently.", "venue": "IEEE Access", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "IEEE Access", "pages": "16907-16922", "volume": "11"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2190030511", "name": "Amira Noor Farhanie Ali"}, {"authorId": "2753877", "name": "M.
