Specifically, we analyze the behavior of the procedure in multiple cloud environments and use experimental evidence to answer multiple research questions concerning the assumption underlying the procedure. We demonstrate improvements in accuracy ranging from 2.3x to 12.5x (5.03x on average) for the tested ScalaBench (and DaCapo) workloads, and from 23.8x to 82.4x (37.4x on average) for the SPEC CPU 2017 workloads.", "venue": "International Conference on Performance Engineering", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book"], "publicationDate": "2020-01-16", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the ACM/SPEC International Conference on Performance Engineering"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2605317", "name": "L.
