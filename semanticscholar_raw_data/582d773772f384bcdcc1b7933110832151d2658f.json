We have worked on this issue due to the increasing complexity of urban transportation systems, coupled with the urgent need to improve efficiency, safety, and sustainability in cities. The work presented in this paper is part of the project METACITIES, an Excellence Hub that spans a large geographical area, that of Southeastern Europe. The approach of the Greek innovation ecosystem of METACITIES involves leveraging digital twin technology to create intelligent replicas of urban mobility environments, enabling real-time monitoring, analysis, and decision making. Through use cases such as \u201cSmart Parking\u201d, \u201cEnvironmental Behavior Analysis on Traffic Incidents\u201d, and \u201cEmergency Management\u201d, we demonstrate how digital twins can optimize traffic flow, mitigate environmental impact, and enhance emergency response; these use cases will be tested on a small scale, before deciding on implementation at a larger and more expensive scale. The final outcome is the METACITIES Architecture for smart mobility, which will be part of an Open Digital Twin Framework capable of evolving a smart city into a metacity.", "venue": "Italian National Conference on Sensors", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-03-01", "journal": {"name": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "volume": "24"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2946906", "name": "Evanthia Faliagka"}, {"authorId": "2264466270", "name": "Eleni Christopoulou"}, {"authorId": "71504752", "name": "Dimitrios Ringas"}, {"authorId": "2264455282", "name": "Tanya Politi"}, {"authorId": "2264449160", "name": "Nikos Kostis"}, {"authorId": "2291002769", "name": "Dimitris Leonardos"}, {"authorId": "2291004770", "name": "Christos Tranoris"}, {"authorId": "2264350321", "name": "Christos P Antonopoulos"}, {"authorId": "1779512", "name": "S.
