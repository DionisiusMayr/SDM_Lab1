In this paper, we describe a technique for embed- ding ontological expressions called Address Expressions, or A-Expressions, in NoSQL queries to improve their portability across diverse physical implementations. We discuss an implementation of such queries over a MongoDB data store of the Enron email corpus with examples, and conduct a preliminary performance assessment.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2016, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2016-10-19", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/1610.06084"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2208953", "name": "Suresh Damodaran"}, {"authorId": "1410565312", "name": "Pedro A.
