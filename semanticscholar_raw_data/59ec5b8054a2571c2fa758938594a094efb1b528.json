A smart irrigation ecosystem combined with Machine Learning can provide solutions that successfully solve the soil humidity sensing task in order to ensure optimal water usage. Existing solutions are based on data received from the power hungry/expensive sensors that are transmitting the sensed data over the wireless channel. Over time, the systems become difficult to maintain, especially in remote areas due to the battery replacement issues with a large number of devices. Therefore, a novel solution must provide an alternative, cost- and energy-effective device that has unique advantage over the existing solutions. This work explores the concept of a novel, low-power, LoRa-based, cost-effective system that achieves humidity sensing using Deep Learning techniques that can be employed to sense soil humidity with high accuracy simply by measuring the signal strength of the given underground beacon device.", "venue": "ACM Trans.
