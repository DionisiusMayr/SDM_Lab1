But the use of deep learning technologies in the cognitive cities domain started only a few years ago; in that regard, there are still many issues that need to be addressed and not enough literature has been developed. This work provides a novel classification framework of cognitive cities using deep learning algorithms that is based in current surveys for known domains such as machine learning and smart cities, but adds the perspective of efficiency, sustainability and resilience that cognitive cities aim to solve.", "venue": "International Conference on eDemocracy & eGovernment", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2019-04-01", "journal": {"name": "2019 Sixth International Conference on eDemocracy & eGovernment (ICEDEG)", "pages": "180-187"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "148083335", "name": "Servio Lima"}, {"authorId": "48928268", "name": "Luis Ter\u00e1n"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "6e55d6671d0f3847eb88a7adfdbaa7046a12c3c3", "title": "Smart Cities for Sustainability - An Analytical Perspective"}, {"paperId": "66480d429f812cb23d5d2ac5d0fc70bbf9a39556", "title": "Internet of Things-Based Energy Management, Challenges, and Solutions in Smart Cities"}, {"paperId": "329768ce219457157ee510ac0eae6593e39ebba7", "title": "Industrial visual perception technology in Smart City"}]}
