VANET technology is offered to provide many facilities to passengers and drivers, including safety, entertainment, mobile commerce, driver assistance, and emergency alarms. VANET has unique features such as high\u2010speed node mobility and network topology dynamics. These special features cause many problems such as increased transmission delays and packet loss. On the other hand, providing a good routing plan for VANET is a critical issue. Therefore, this article proposes a cluster\u2010based routing using in\u2010vehicle meta\u2010heuristic algorithms (CRMHA\u2010VANET) which has two phases. In the first stage, the vehicles are clustered and the most suitable cluster head (CH) is selected using the gray wolf optimization algorithm (GWO). In the next step, the next suitable CH is selected for data transmission in direct paths using the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). The performance of the proposed method is analyzed through several criteria such as package delivery rate, end\u2010to\u2010end delay and throughput. CRMHA\u2010VANET results in a 10% to 25% improvement over all performance metrics, that is, packet delivery rate, latency, and throughput, over CRBP (clustering routing based on PSO [particle swarm optimization]), WCV (weight based clustering for VANET), and AODV\u2010CD methods.", "venue": "Concurrency and Computation", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-08-15", "journal": {"name": "Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience", "volume": "34"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2176457652", "name": "Behbod Kheradmand"}, {"authorId": "115927966", "name": "A.
