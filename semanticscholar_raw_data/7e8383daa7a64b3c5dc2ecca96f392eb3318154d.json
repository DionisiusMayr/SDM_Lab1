However, current systems focus on a single data representation for trajectories. In this paper, we present the research outline of a Ph.D. in its early stages, where we plan to propose an algebra and a corresponding set of logical and physical operators to support complex trajectory queries by considering different trajectory data representations. Furthermore, we propose to design a demonstrator system as proof of concept.", "venue": "EDBT/ICDT Workshops", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2191739685", "name": "Johann Bornholdt"}], "citations": []}
