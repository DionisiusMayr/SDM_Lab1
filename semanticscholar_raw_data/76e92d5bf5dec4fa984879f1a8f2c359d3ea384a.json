More recently, edge and fog computing resources have emerged on the wide\u2010area network as part of Internet of things (IoT) deployments. These three resource abstraction layers are complementary, and offer distinctive benefits. Scheduling applications on clouds has been an active area of research, with workflow and data flow models offering a flexible abstraction to specify applications for execution. However, the application programming and scheduling models for edge and fog are still maturing, and can benefit from learnings on cloud resources. At the same time, there is also value in using these resources cohesively for application execution. In this article, we offer a taxonomy of concepts essential for specifying and solving the problem of scheduling applications on edge, fog, and cloud computing resources. We first characterize the resource capabilities and limitations of these infrastructure and offer a taxonomy of application models, quality\u2010of\u2010service constraints and goals, and scheduling techniques, based on a literature review. We also tabulate key research prototypes and papers using this taxonomy. This survey benefits developers and researchers on these distributed resources in designing and categorizing their applications, selecting the relevant computing abstraction(s), and developing or selecting the appropriate scheduling algorithm. It also highlights gaps in literature where open problems remain.", "venue": "Software, Practice & Experience", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2019-04-23", "journal": {"name": "Software: Practice and Experience", "pages": "558 - 595", "volume": "50"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "9561284", "name": "Prateeksha Varshney"}, {"authorId": "1761220", "name": "Yogesh L.
