However, the features of such devices make them attractive targets for potential attackers. Indeed, each device will have to deal with new vulnerabilities and attacks during its lifecycle. Therefore, defining a secure mechanism for software/firmware updates is essential to guarantee the security of IoT devices. Although different approaches have been proposed in recent years, currently there is a lack of comprehensive approaches to address different requirements, such as scalability, efficiency, or management of versions and dependencies. In this work, we describe a set of challenges and analyze the current landscape of solutions for software/firmware updates in IoT devices. In particular, we focus our analysis on the IETF SUIT working group, as well as blockchain-based solutions, which have attracted a significant interest recently.", "venue": "Global Internet of Things Summit", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-06-01", "journal": {"name": "2020 Global Internet of Things Summit (GIoTS)", "pages": "1-5"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "144746857", "name": "Jos\u00e9 Luis Hern\u00e1ndez Ramos"}, {"authorId": "3189946", "name": "G.
