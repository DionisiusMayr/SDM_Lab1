We define a dynamic matching algorithm to be \u03b1 (respectively ( \u03b1, \u03b2 ))-approximate if it maintains matching M such that at all times | M | \u2265 \u00b5 ( G ) \u00b7 \u03b1 (respectively | M | \u2265 \u00b5 ( G ) \u00b7 \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2 ). We present the first deterministic (1 \u2212 \u03b5 )-approximate dynamic matching algorithm with O (poly( \u03b5 \u2212 1 )) amortized update time for graphs undergoing edge insertions. Previous solutions either required super-constant [Gupta FSTTCS\u201914, Bhattacharya-Kiss-Saranurak SODA\u201923] or exponential in 1 /\u03b5 [Grandoni-Leonardi-Sankowski-Schwiegelshohn-Solomon SODA\u201919] update time. Our implementation is arguably simpler than the mentioned algorithms and its description is self contained. Moreover, we show that if we allow for additive (1 , \u03b5 \u00b7 n )-approximation our algorithm seamlessly extends to also handle vertex deletions, on top of edge insertions. This makes our algorithm one of the few small update time algorithms for (1 \u2212 \u03b5 )-approximate dynamic matching allowing for updates both increasing and decreasing the maximum matching size of G in a fully dynamic manner. Our algorithm relies on the weighted variant of the celebrated Edge-Degree-Constrained-Subgraph (EDCS) datastructure introduced by [Bernstein-Stein ICALP\u201915]. As far as we are aware we introduce the first application of the weighted-EDCS for arbitrarily dense graphs. We also present a significantly simplified proof for the approximation ratio of weighed-EDCS as a matching sparsifier compared to [Bernstein-Stein], as well as simple descriptions of a fractional matching and fractional vertex cover defined on top of the EDCS. Considering the wide range of applications EDCS has found in settings such as streaming, sub-linear, stochastic and more we hope our techniques will be of independent research interest outside of the dynamic setting.", "venue": "", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "89931375", "name": "Joakim Blikstad"}, {"authorId": "2187429133", "name": "Peter Kiss"}, {"authorId": "2249662567", "name": "Inge Li"}, {"authorId": "1398716192", "name": "Mart\u00edn Farach-Colton"}, {"authorId": "1879835", "name": "S.
