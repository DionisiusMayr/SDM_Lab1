Due to its flexibility and simplicity it has become a popular framework, hence the amount of RDF data is increasing fast. Querying massive amount of data is a serious challenge in general and it is true for RDF data as well. In this paper we investigating how to evaluate SPARQL queries on a distributed system. We propose a novel method for evaluating SPARQL queries using the GraphX graph analytical tool. GraphX is built on the top of Spark that is an in-memory data processing system for distributive computation. With this tool we managed to utilize the graph-like structure of the RDF statements which are in form of subject-predicate-object.", "venue": "2016 IEEE 4th International Conference on Future Internet of Things and Cloud Workshops (FiCloudW)", "year": 2016, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2016-08-01", "journal": {"name": "2016 IEEE 4th International Conference on Future Internet of Things and Cloud Workshops (FiCloudW)", "pages": "188-193"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "47060188", "name": "G.
