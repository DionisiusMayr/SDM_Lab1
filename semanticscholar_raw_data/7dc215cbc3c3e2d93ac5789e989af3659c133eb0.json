IoT applications can generate a massive amount of data, with a significant part containing geospatial aspects and requiring applications to deal with the objects' geospatial relationships and extract information and knowledge. This article describes a systematic literature mapping investigating the geospatial evolution of big data in the IoT. For the mapping, 116 documents were selected from four academic databases\u2014Scopus, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, and Web of Science\u2014and classified according to their main contributions. The analysis of these works allowed us to view what domains have applied geospatial big data from IoT, the artifacts that support this application, and the most prolific authors and venues involved in this research area.", "venue": "Trans.
