To meet deadlines, several flow scheduling schemes for datacenter networks are proposed, but most of them are unaware of bandwidth variations, leading to suboptimal throughputs. In this paper, we present a flow scheduling scheme, called UBAS, to improve deadline-meeting throughputs for time-critical applications with uncertain time-varying bandwidth allocations. First, we model an optimization problem of scheduling deadline-constrained flows under uncertain time-varying bandwidth allocations to maximize the expected deadline-meeting throughput. The problem is NP-hard. Then, we propose an approximation algorithm under a mild condition for the problem in a special case, where bandwidth allocations are certain, as well as a conditional approximation algorithm for the problem in general. To adapt to practice, scalable and online variants of the algorithm are also presented. In evaluation, we conduct simulations based on a real traffic trace in a production datacenter. The results demonstrate that, with severe practical settings, UBAS still achieves nearly optimal deadline-meeting throughputs. Moreover, the throughput improvements of UBAS against existing bandwidth-agnostic schemes are more substantial when the variance of bandwidth allocations over time increases.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Services Computing", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-05-01", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Transactions on Services Computing", "pages": "437-450", "volume": "13"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2927108", "name": "Jiann-Min Ho"}, {"authorId": "1749408", "name": "P.
