Fog is highly distributed and consists of a wide number of autonomous end devices, which contribute to the processing. However, the variety of devices offered across different users are not audited. Hence, the security of Fog devices is a major concern that should come into consideration. Therefore, to provide the necessary security for Fog devices, there is a need to understand what the security concerns are with regards to Fog. All aspects of Fog security, which have not been covered by other literature works, need to be identified and aggregated. On the other hand, privacy preservation for user\u2019s data in Fog devices and application data processed in Fog devices is another concern. To provide the appropriate level of trust and privacy, there is a need to focus on authentication, threats and access control mechanisms as well as privacy protection techniques in Fog computing. In this paper, a survey along with a taxonomy is proposed, which presents an overview of existing security concerns in the context of the Fog computing paradigm. Moreover, the Blockchain-based solutions towards a secure Fog computing environment is presented and various research challenges and directions for future research are discussed.", "venue": "Electronics", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2021-05-14", "journal": {"name": "Electronics", "pages": "1171", "volume": "10"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1515559453", "name": "Abdullah Al-Noman Patwary"}, {"authorId": "8610236", "name": "R.
