It relies on continuously logging state updates to a remote storage service and periodically compacting the update-log via a background process. We highlight a tradeoff between the intensity of compaction of the IC update-log (and the associated resource overhead) and its impact on recovery time in such systems. We also highlight the control parameters that can be used to adjust this tradeoff in the Apache Samza stream processing system, and demonstrate this tradeoff experimentally.", "venue": "2019 38th International Symposium on Reliable Distributed Systems Workshops (SRDSW)", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2019-10-01", "journal": {"name": "2019 38th International Symposium on Reliable Distributed Systems Workshops (SRDSW)", "pages": "1-6"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1471723809", "name": "Aris Chronarakis"}, {"authorId": "2523004", "name": "Antonis Papaioannou"}, {"authorId": "1734219", "name": "K.
