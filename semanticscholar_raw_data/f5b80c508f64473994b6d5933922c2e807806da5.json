In the study that directed this paper, a descriptive design was employed and thematic analysis was done on the information obtained through key informant interviews. The population of this study consisted of the two systems librarians who work in the electronic library (e-library) unit of the university library. The characteristics of big data, based on the V characteristics, were examined, as well as the various types of data sets found in academic libraries. The findings of the study revealed that while big data sets exist in libraries in Nigeria, none of the big data software was available in the library studied. The findings also revealed the various methods used by the University of Ilorin Library in generating big data. Also, the main challenges confronting the management of big data in the University of Ilorin Library include inadequate funding, insufficient infrastructure, and inadequate software tools for managing big data. The need to re-skill library practitioners in this new technology, as a means of surmounting challenges in service delivery in university libraries, was recommended.", "venue": "Mousaion", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-07-12", "journal": {"name": "Mousaion: South African Journal of Information Studies"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2036758322", "name": "A.
