It was implemented in the intraframe processing unit of the Lemur software to automatically detect new objects and track known ones. Owing to the use of Lemur software and the proposed computational method implemented in it, more than 700,000 measurements of various objects under study were successfully processed and identified.", "venue": "", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "51242042", "name": "S.
