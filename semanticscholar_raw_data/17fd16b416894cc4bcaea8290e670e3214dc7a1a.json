However, the adoption of such technologies is slow as many of them are not cost-effective and focus on specific functions such as energy efficiency. Recently, IoT devices and sensors have been designed to enhance the quality of personal life by having the capability to generate continuous data streams that can be used to monitor and make inferences by the user. While smart home devices connect to the home Wi-Fi network, there are still compatibility issues between devices from different manufacturers. Smart devices get even smarter when they can communicate with and control each other. The information collected by one device can be shared with others for achieving an enhanced automation of their operations. This paper proposes a non-intrusive approach of integrating and collecting data from open standard IoT devices for personalised smart home automation using big data analytics and machine learning. We demonstrate the implementation of our proposed novel technology instantiation approach for achieving non-intrusive IoT based big data analytics with a use case of a smart home environment. We employ open-source frameworks such as Apache Spark, Apache NiFi and FB-Prophet along with popular vendor tech-stacks such as Azure and DataBricks.", "venue": "Big Data and Cognitive Computing", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-01-30", "journal": {"name": "Big Data Cogn.
