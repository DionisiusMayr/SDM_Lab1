This paper proposes a Map-Reduce based parallel strategy--Map-Combine-Reduce (MCR)---to treat the join aggregation of large-scale spatial data. MCR takes advantage of combine stage in Map-Reduce model to integrate the partial aggregation results distributed at variousmaperp and reducers. Filter optimizationwas proposed to facilitate single-allocation issues of spatial objects in division of parallel tasks to further improve the efficiency of join aggregation querying. Experimental results have proven its efficiency, effectiveness, and simplification during processing spatial join aggregation query.", "venue": "", "year": 2016, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2016-10-04", "journal": {"name": "", "volume": ""}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2093200995", "name": "Chuang Yao"}, {"authorId": "2145146876", "name": "Luo Chen"}, {"authorId": "9236753", "name": "Jinxin Shen"}], "citations": []}
