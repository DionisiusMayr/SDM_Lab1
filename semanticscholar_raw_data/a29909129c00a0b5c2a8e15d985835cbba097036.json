Considering more practical factors to get more accurate result sets, we first use C-Means clustering to classify data preprocessing, so as to reduce the calculation of redundant data and the sparsity of matrix. Secondly, the cosine similarity and Pearson similarity are applied to improve the user similarity calculation. Finally, a mixed recommendation function is constructed. On the Spark distributed large data platform, this method trains and compares the results offline and real-time through MovieLens data set, which shows that it reduces the computing time, improves the efficiency and accuracy of the algorithm.", "venue": "International Conference on Innovative Computing and Cloud Computing", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2019-12-01", "journal": {"name": "2019 IEEE 5th International Conference on Computer and Communications (ICCC)", "pages": "8-12"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2145540103", "name": "Haorui Li"}, {"authorId": "2111288003", "name": "Qiang Huang"}], "citations": []}
