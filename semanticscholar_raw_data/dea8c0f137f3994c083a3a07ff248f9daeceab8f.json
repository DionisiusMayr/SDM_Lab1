The aim thereby is to automatically \ndetect the deviations in performance as fault symptoms. For that type of data-based modelling, the algorithms \nof clustering are selected with an emphasis on the computational load and application complexity. Kohonen \nneural networks (self-organizing maps) are found suitable for the task due to the ability to efficiently operate on \nhigh dimensional data and because of their robustness against uncertainties. They reveal drawbacks from the \nperspective of identifying the deviating variable in the input space. A novel structure is designed to solve this \ndilemma by combining multi one-dimensional domains and their statistical relationships, where Kohonen and \nBayesian algorithms would be directly applicable. The structure is introduced and applied to simulate the \nhuman supervisors in the way of learning normal operation and hence, attempts to automatically identify the \ndeviating variable in a high amount of data. An example application is proposed for detecting the wear \ndegradation fault in a real electrohydraulic drive that widely used in many industrial machines. The algorithm \ncan be realized locally or integrated remotely in cloud architectures.", "venue": "", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "WSEAS Transactions on Circuits and Systems archive", "volume": "18"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "144773965", "name": "E.
