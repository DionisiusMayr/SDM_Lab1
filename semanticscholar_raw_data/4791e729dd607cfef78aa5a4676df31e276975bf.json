These databases use data structures with irregular control flow like trees and hash tables which map poorly to existing database accelerators, leaving architects with a choice between CPUS\u2014 with stagnant performance\u2014or accelerators that handle this complexity by relying on simpler but asymptotically sub-optimal algorithms.To bridge this gap, we propose Aurochs: a reconfigurable dataflow accelerator (RDA) that matches a CPU asymptotically but outperforms it by over 100 \u00d7 on constant factors. We introduce a threading model for vector dataflow accelerators that extracts massive parallelism from irregular data structures using lightweight thread contexts. To implement this model, we add only a sparse scratchpad to an existing database accelerator\u2014 increasing area by 5 %. We reformulate common data structures using dataflow threads and evaluate Aurochs on ridesharing queries\u2014outperforming a GPU by 8 \u00d7.", "venue": "International Symposium on Computer Architecture", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book"], "publicationDate": "2021-06-01", "journal": {"name": "2021 ACM/IEEE 48th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA)", "pages": "402-415"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3405776", "name": "Matthew Vilim"}, {"authorId": "3332339", "name": "Alexander Rucker"}, {"authorId": "1746638", "name": "K.
