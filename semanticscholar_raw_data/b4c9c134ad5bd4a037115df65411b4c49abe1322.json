The mathematical foundations and the problem statement are considered. The description of the used data set and the architecture of proposed security monitoring framework are provided. The framework specifies several machine learning mechanisms intended for solving classification tasks. The classifier operation results are exposed to plurality voting, weighted voting, and soft voting. The framework performance and accuracy is assessed experimentally.", "venue": "IEEE Access", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "IEEE Access", "pages": "72714-72723", "volume": "6"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "16777650", "name": "Igor Kotenko"}, {"authorId": "145683384", "name": "I.
