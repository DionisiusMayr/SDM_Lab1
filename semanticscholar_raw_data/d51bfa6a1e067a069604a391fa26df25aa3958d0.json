(A more appropriate description could be \"in nite\" data, e.g., in the application of optical observation and control, data are continuously generated, cre-ating a data disaster.) The term of big data is coined to capture the profound meaning of this emerging trend.Compared with traditional data, big data exhibits some unique characteristics besides the sheer volume, such as commonly un-structured data and more real-time analysis requirements. The development of big data calls for new system architectures for data storage and large-scale data processing mechanisms. In this paper, we present a literature survey of big data analytics. Firstly, the de nition of big data and big data challenges are presented. Secondly, a systematic framework to decompose big data system into four sequential modules, namely data generation, data acquisition, data storage, and data analytics, which form the value chain for big data, is proposed. A detailed survey of numerous approaches and mechanisms related to each module, from research and industry communities is discussed. Finally, some evaluation benchmarks and potential scienti c problems in big data systems are outlined.", "venue": "", "year": 2015, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering"], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2015-01-20", "journal": {"name": "", "pages": "1-44", "volume": "45"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "67180560", "name": "Xuelong Li"}, {"authorId": "3146009", "name": "Hai-gang Gong"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "856d40a76afc67ee7f571174c4a6315d919b6695", "title": "Research on the design of scientific research management platform based on big data analysis"}, {"paperId": "77c2c779633692ded8b4e4cc1f780f7f33292893", "title": "Big Data-Driven Business Model Innovation (BMI) From the Perspective of Ambidexterity: Case Study of L.
