However, these theoretical results have received very little attention from the practical perspective. Few of the algorithms are implemented and tested on real datasets, and their practical potential is far from understood. Here, we present a quick reference guide to recent engineering and theory results in the area of fully dynamic graph algorithms.", "venue": "ACM Journal of Experimental Algorithmics", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-02-22", "journal": {"name": "ACM Journal of Experimental Algorithmics", "pages": "1 - 45", "volume": "27"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2994002", "name": "Kathrin Hanauer"}, {"authorId": "1744110", "name": "Monika Henzinger"}, {"authorId": "40262967", "name": "Christian Schulz"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "6a3816c4f3189f46cba8b2d571bb6890cf47c2a0", "title": "A survey on dynamic graph processing on GPUs: concepts, terminologies and systems"}, {"paperId": "bce8075ca74c49a51fbca7fae43bdbfd23d2152d", "title": "Incremental Computation: What Is the Essence?
