Cloud computing is a modern technology for dealing with big data to perform specified operations. The cloud addresses the problem of selecting and placing iterations across nodes in fog computing. Previous studies focused on original swarm intelligent and mathematical models; thus, we proposed a novel hybrid method based on two modern metaheuristic algorithms. This paper combined the Aquila Optimizer (AO) algorithm with the elephant herding optimization (EHO) for solving dynamic data replication problems in the fog computing environment. In the proposed method, we present a set of objectives that determine data transmission paths, choose the least cost path, reduce network bottlenecks, bandwidth, balance, and speed data transfer rates between nodes in cloud computing. A hybrid method, AOEHO, addresses the optimal and least expensive path, determines the best replication via cloud computing, and determines optimal nodes to select and place data replication near users. Moreover, we developed a multi-objective optimization based on the proposed AOEHO to decrease the bandwidth and enhance load balancing and cloud throughput. The proposed method is evaluated based on data replication using seven criteria. These criteria are data replication access, distance, costs, availability, SBER, popularity, and the Floyd algorithm. The experimental results show the superiority of the proposed AOEHO strategy performance over other algorithms, such as bandwidth, distance, load balancing, data transmission, and least cost path.", "venue": "Italian National Conference on Sensors", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-02-01", "journal": {"name": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "volume": "23"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2202060175", "name": "Ahmed Awad Mohamed"}, {"authorId": "7833679", "name": "L.
