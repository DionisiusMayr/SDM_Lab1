Almost all professional clubs analyze matches to improve the performance of their teams. However, events are still predominantly captured manually, although many sensor-based and video-based tracking systems exist which provide the positions of the players and the ball in real-time. This manual process is tedious and error-prone. In this paper, we present STREAMTEAM-FOOTBALL, an open source football analysis application, that fills this gap. STREAMTEAM-FOOTBALL allows to analyze football matches fully automatically and in real-time on the basis of tracked position data using a data stream analysis approach. Our evaluation confirms the effectiveness of our automated analysis.", "venue": "2020 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2020-12-10", "journal": {"name": "2020 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "pages": "637-644"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2373717", "name": "L.
