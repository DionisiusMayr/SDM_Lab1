The selection of the appropriate data storage technology is a pivotal consideration in achieving this objective. While prior studies have examined SQL and NoSQL databases in terms of latency and energy efficiency, these evaluations have not been conducted specifically within the context of IIoT. This paper aims to fill this research gap by conducting a rigorous comparison of SQL and NoSQL databases, focusing on their performance latency and energy efficiency when interfaced with IoT nodes. By elucidating these relationships, our research offers actionable insights that can guide IIoT-enabled manufacturing facilities in optimizing their operations. Specifically, the paper aids in the selection of the most suitable database technology, thereby contributing to latency minimization and efficiency maximization in industrial settings.", "venue": "IEEE Access", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "IEEE Access", "pages": "129247-129257", "volume": "11"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "52238788", "name": "Soukaina Bakhat Kenitar"}, {"authorId": "3399892", "name": "M.
