For this reason, focusing on the matter of imbalance within the fault category, this paper proposes a novel unsupervised partial domain adaptational fault diagnosis method\u2014a partial domain adaptation adversarial network (PDAAN). On the one hand, it uses the source domain fault samples to expand the target domain and promotes the effective alignment of the fault feature area of the source domain and the target domain, in order for the model to effectively extract domain invariant features; on the other hand, class-level weights and weighted entropy weights are introduced into the loss function to suppress the uncertainty within the transfer process and avoid negative transfer of the model. Finally, experiments are conducted in the case of variable working conditions and cross-mechanical devices, and it is confirmed that the PDAAN model has high recognition accuracy in the case of class space asymmetry.", "venue": "Measurement science and technology", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Physics"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-08-01", "journal": {"name": "Measurement Science and Technology", "volume": "33"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2146383304", "name": "Huafeng Zhou"}, {"authorId": "9118062", "name": "Peiyuan Cheng"}, {"authorId": "9122533", "name": "Siyu Shao"}, {"authorId": "2154704094", "name": "Yuwei Zhao"}, {"authorId": "2150441327", "name": "X.
