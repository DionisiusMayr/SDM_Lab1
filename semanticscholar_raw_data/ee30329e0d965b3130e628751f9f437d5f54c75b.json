Even though it is still in the initial testing stage, the blockchain is being viewed as a progressive solution to address present-day technology concerns, such as decentralization, identity, trust, character, ownership of data, and information-driven choices. Simultaneously, the world is facing an increase in the diversity and quantity of digital information produced by machines and users. While effectively looking for the ideal approach to storing and processing cloud data, the blockchain innovation provides significant inputs. This article reviews the application of blockchain technology for securing cloud storage.", "venue": "ACM Computing Surveys", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2020-08-03", "journal": {"name": "ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR)", "pages": "1 - 32", "volume": "53"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "48267756", "name": "Pratima Sharma"}, {"authorId": "34432300", "name": "Rajni Jindal"}, {"authorId": "39588864", "name": "M.
