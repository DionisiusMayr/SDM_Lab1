We applied keyword network analysis on articles whose keywords match the themes of the International Conference on Communication and Information Processing, collected through the Thompson Reuters' Web of Science and studied the articles' thematic interconnections and their dynamics. The keyword network was found to be clustered around the themes cloud, data, mobile, security, semantic and social. Security and embeddedness are found to be the most dominant topics, common to all groups. Design and performance are key influencers of thematic flows and data mining/analysis are close to all nodes/keywords and therefore most popular. Big data, data fusion/integration and e-government are themes identified as potentially strong future influencers.", "venue": "International Conference on Critical Infrastructure Protection", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2017-11-24", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Communication and Information Processing"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2539832", "name": "Fefie Dotsika"}, {"authorId": "143938878", "name": "Andrew Watkins"}], "citations": []}
