Within Reach for Software!", "abstract": "Events that take 10s to 100s of ns like cache misses increasingly cause CPU stalls. However, hiding the latency of these events is challenging: hardware mechanisms suffer from the lack of flexibility, whereas prior software mechanisms fall short due to large overhead and limited event visibility. In this paper, we argue that with a combination of two emerging techniques - light-weight coroutines and sample-based profiling, hiding these events in software is within reach.", "venue": "USENIX Workshop on Hot Topics in Operating Systems", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-06-22", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 19th Workshop on Hot Topics in Operating Systems"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2114938398", "name": "Zhihong Luo"}, {"authorId": "32302537", "name": "Silvery Fu"}, {"authorId": "2053398", "name": "Emmanuel Amaro"}, {"authorId": "1961095", "name": "Amy Ousterhout"}, {"authorId": "1699297", "name": "Sylvia Ratnasamy"}, {"authorId": "143838343", "name": "S.
