Traditional approaches in RSs include such as collaborative filtering (CF) and content-based filtering (CBF) through these approaches that have certain limitations, such as the necessity of prior user history and habits for performing the task of recommendation. To minimize the effect of such limitation, this article proposes a hybrid RS for the movies that leverage the best of concepts used from CF and CBF along with sentiment analysis of tweets from microblogging sites. The purpose to use movie tweets is to understand the current trends, public sentiment, and user response of the movie. Experiments conducted on the public database have yielded promising results.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2018-11-27", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems", "pages": "915-923", "volume": "7"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2155295265", "name": "Sudhanshu Kumar"}, {"authorId": "2924283", "name": "K.
