It provides a range of efficient algorithms for probabilistic inference queries, such as computing marginal probabilities (MAR), as well as many more advanced queries. Certain structural circuit properties are needed to achieve this tractability, which Juice helps validate. Additionally, it supports several parameter and structure learning algorithms proposed in the recent literature. By leveraging parallelism (on both CPU and GPU), Juice provides a fast implementation of circuit-based algorithms, which makes it suitable for tackling large-scale datasets and models.", "venue": "AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2021-05-18", "journal": {"pages": "16020-16023"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1823968060", "name": "Meihua Dang"}, {"authorId": "80198932", "name": "Pasha Khosravi"}, {"authorId": "2141192339", "name": "Yitao Liang"}, {"authorId": "14341992", "name": "Antonio Vergari"}, {"authorId": "1749506", "name": "Guy Van den Broeck"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "2279f8f0a599df27c0ad3a6ae408e644ae87ef78", "title": "Probabilistic Neural Circuits"}, {"paperId": "e34d7cae9644f4eb5f5fb9d2247ce239f15d5603", "title": "Deriving Comprehensible Theories from Probabilistic Circuits"}, {"paperId": "f1f0102d47552f6758b000539d3d4c49da9555c8", "title": "Tractable and Expressive Generative Models of Genetic Variation Data"}, {"paperId": "c4fb74b5f69e5c0f3822b82e1bd082d5d95fc8d0", "title": "Tractable Control for Autoregressive Language Generation"}, {"paperId": "541c4a85a67bcc8ae5cfb12fe62ad32ebc0a6495", "title": "Understanding the Distillation Process from Deep Generative Models to Tractable Probabilistic Circuits"}, {"paperId": "0f9321e3733b79149172ceaefc5e8c1b7ab48a67", "title": "Sparse Probabilistic Circuits via Pruning and Growing"}, {"paperId": "af6e8ef9352ed2a82b168032c6d35655afc54f57", "title": "Scaling Up Probabilistic Circuits by Latent Variable Distillation"}, {"paperId": "7311d1dc33e335f37494712f4d4b60ed6c20fe7a", "title": "Belief Revision in Sentential Decision Diagrams"}, {"paperId": "a7487a7a2e92a740bad790eb986087f0f5cd694c", "title": "DPU: DAG Processing Unit for Irregular Graphs With Precision-Scalable Posit Arithmetic in 28 nm"}, {"paperId": "43157e4f2e4c7f85cdfa9e4a92eff7b3bcecb2c7", "title": "Lossless Compression with Probabilistic Circuits"}, {"paperId": "542343784e0ea41b6a8d5765e16aec3f75ddc398", "title": "Strudel: A fast and accurate learner of structured-decomposable probabilistic circuits"}, {"paperId": "7e06de11c65381f7e9b60e538ae3111b27f89ab3", "title": "Structural Learning of Probabilistic Sentential Decision Diagrams under Partial Closed-World Assumption"}, {"paperId": "d7199deca9f8b8ca446bad92f33bcfe7b021bdc6", "title": "Tractable Regularization of Probabilistic Circuits"}, {"paperId": "2373d0632142d04c6ad9e64e01c529a585198d93", "title": "Probabilistic Sufficient Explanations"}, {"paperId": "f930fe86da74a48556b6c8b6af23a1a595747a3f", "title": "GraphOpt: Constrained-Optimization-Based Parallelization of Irregular Graphs"}, {"paperId": "25ab11f27236f9026144dfb4feb1c9cdef0b45b4", "title": "A Compositional Atlas of Tractable Circuit Operations: From Simple Transformations to Complex Information-Theoretic Queries"}, {"paperId": "12d7d4a8799c36684eaca995478a26f7329a7386", "title": "IL-Strudel : Independence-Based Learning of Structured-Decomposable Probabilistic Circuit Ensembles"}, {"paperId": "c4c23cdd9d3ab1e20dd19b6d409196beeb90d548", "title": "A Compositional Atlas of Tractable Circuit Operations for Probabilistic Inference"}, {"paperId": "d95db20474fb223d629c07dc47577da6489c9c5c", "title": "Learning probabilistic sentential decision diagrams under logic constraints by sampling and averaging"}, {"paperId": "cc648443aaa8bdb21663ee3c9dfaafc6b8e5770f", "title": "Unified Representations for Learning and Reasoning"}]}
