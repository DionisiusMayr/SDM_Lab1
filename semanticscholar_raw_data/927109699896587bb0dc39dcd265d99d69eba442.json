The multiple data collected is so voluminous and variable that it must be stored in Big Data architectures. This evolution has provided the opportunity to have better access, quality and analysis of information, but at the same time, there is a challenge to prevent and mitigate the security risks associated with the relationship between IoT and Big Data, endangering the information collected and the user\u2019 sensitive data, among others. The purpose of this document is to carry out a literature review to collect the security risks found between the relationship of Big Data and IoT, as well as evaluate the current solutions implemented and conclude if they cover the needs for prevention and mitigation of the risk.", "venue": "Ingenier\u00eda y Competitividad", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2020-09-28", "journal": {"name": "INGENIER\u00cdA Y COMPETITIVIDAD"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2126458382", "name": "Yigliana Alvarez Mendoza"}, {"authorId": "2126458573", "name": "Tania J.
