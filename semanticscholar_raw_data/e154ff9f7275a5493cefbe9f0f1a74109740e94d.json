Current best practice aims at this using a combination of package managers, workflow engines, and containers. Results We present BioNix, a lightweight library built on the Nix deployment system. BioNix manages software dependencies, computational environments, and workflow stages together using a single abstraction: pure functions. This lets users specify workflows in a clean, uniform way, with strong reproducibility guarantees.
