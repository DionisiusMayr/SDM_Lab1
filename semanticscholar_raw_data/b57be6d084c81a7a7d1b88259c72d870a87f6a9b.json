According to this concept, appropriate therapies should be selected for specific groups of patients. PM makes it possible to predict whether a particular therapy will be effective for a particular patient. PM will still have to overcome many challenges and barriers before it can be successfully implemented in healthcare systems. However, it is essential to remember that PM is not a medical revolution but an evolution. Methods: Three focus groups were conducted, to achieve the purpose of this study, which was to identify the barriers and facilitators existing to the implementation of PM and to highlight existing practices in European countries. Focus group discussions covered the areas of barriers and facilitators to the implementation of personalized medicine. Results: This section describes the results of the focus groups that covered the areas of barriers and facilitators of personalized medicine implementation. Conclusions: Personalized medicine faces many challenges and barriers before it can be successfully implemented in health systems. The translation of PM to European countries, differences in regulations, high costs of new technologies, and reimbursement are the reasons for the delay in PM implementation.", "venue": "Journal of Personalized Medicine", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-02-21", "journal": {"name": "Journal of Personalized Medicine", "volume": "13"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2006780366", "name": "Dorota Stefanicka-Wojtas"}, {"authorId": "3774599", "name": "D.
