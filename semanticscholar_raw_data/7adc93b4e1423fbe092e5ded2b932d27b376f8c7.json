While detecting and profiling the sources that spread this news is important to maintain a healthy society, it is challenging for automated systems. In this paper, we propose an interactive framework for news media profiling. It combines the strengths of graph based news media profiling models, Pre-trained Large Language Models, and human insight to characterize the social context on social media. Experimental results show that with as little as 5 human interactions, our framework can rapidly detect fake and biased news media, even in the most challenging settings of emerging news events, where test data is unseen.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-09-14", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2309.07384"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "144370236", "name": "Nikhil Mehta"}, {"authorId": "2240520676", "name": "Dan Goldwasser"}], "citations": []}
