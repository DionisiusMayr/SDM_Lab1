However, existing systems do not provide latency guarantee, a critical requirement of real-time analytics, especially for stateful operators under burst and skewed workload. We present StreamSwitch, a control plane for stream systems to bound operator latency while optimizing resource usage. Based on a novel stream switch abstraction that unifies dynamic scaling and load balancing into a holistic control framework, our design incorporates reactive and predictive metrics to deduce the healthiness of executors and prescribes practically optimal scaling and load balancing decisions in time. We implement a prototype of StreamSwitch and integrate it with Apache Flink and Samza. Experimental evaluations on real-world applications and benchmarks show that StreamSwitch provides cost-effective solutions for bounding latency and outperforms the state-of-the-art alternative solutions.", "venue": "IEEE Conference on Computer Communications", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-05-17", "journal": {"name": "IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications", "pages": "1-10"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2236529065", "name": "Zhaochen She"}, {"authorId": "2152119732", "name": "Yancan Mao"}, {"authorId": "2236539347", "name": "Hailin Xiang"}, {"authorId": "2153687572", "name": "Xin Wang"}, {"authorId": "144030168", "name": "Richard T.
