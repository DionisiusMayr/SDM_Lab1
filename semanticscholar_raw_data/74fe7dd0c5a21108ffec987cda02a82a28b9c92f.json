When responding to security problems, participants' remarkable average reaction time of 14 minutes demonstrated their preparedness. On a 5-point rating scale, the clarity and openness of privacy rules were scored 3.8 overall; however, differences between 3.5 and 4.2 indicated the range of privacy issues. These results highlight the need of well-defined security procedures, thorough training, and easily available, transparent privacy regulations in order to manage the ethical integration of AI into Industry 5.0 and promote stakeholder confidence and data protection.", "venue": "BIO Web of Conferences", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "BIO Web of Conferences"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2280525158", "name": "Ekaterina Dmitrieva"}, {"authorId": "2256255560", "name": "Vinod Balmiki"}, {"authorId": "2280462119", "name": "Nitin Bhardwaj"}, {"authorId": "2281030630", "name": "Kaushal Kumar"}, {"authorId": "2280860433", "name": "Achyut Sharma"}, {"authorId": "2256244128", "name": "Ch.M.
