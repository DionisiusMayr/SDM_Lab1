However, the majority of graph engines have been designed without considering the power-law degree distribution of real-world graphs seriously. Two problems have been observed when existing graph engines process real-world graphs: inefficient scanning of the sparse indicator and the delay in iteration progress due to uneven workload distribution. In this paper, we propose RealGraph, a single-machine based graph engine equipped with the hierarchical indicator and the block-based workload allocation. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that RealGraph significantly outperforms existing graph engines in terms of both speed and scalability.", "venue": "The Web Conference", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2019-05-13", "journal": {"name": "The World Wide Web Conference"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2424383", "name": "Yong-Yeon Jo"}, {"authorId": "7940405", "name": "Myung-Hwan Jang"}, {"authorId": "51967113", "name": "Sang-Wook Kim"}, {"authorId": "1973288", "name": "Sunju Park"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "4754eb1e8cb338cb0983ad45af605d6c50f02c8f", "title": "On Overcoming HPC Challenges of Trillion-Scale Real-World Graph Datasets"}, {"paperId": "1008d7b2e04af5dedf343bac72bdbc5b63773295", "title": "MS-BioGraphs: Sequence Similarity Graph Datasets"}, {"paperId": "ba801a69bfcf5d9e8562209fc269a59084ef01c6", "title": "SAGE: A Storage-Based Approach for Scalable and Efficient Sparse Generalized Matrix-Matrix Multiplication"}, {"paperId": "adf38dbd51a04e88c6e38865570b6c9e4090bda0", "title": "RealGraph+: A High-Performance Single-Machine-Based Graph Engine that Utilizes IO Bandwidth Effectively"}, {"paperId": "04739b44e51920d92e063e5d2f4489015681a095", "title": "Disentangling Degree-related Biases and Interest for Out-of-Distribution Generalized Directed Network Embedding"}, {"paperId": "8a9a5116d0b754441c20bf5dceab4130f2ff39b0", "title": "EnD: Enhanced Dedensification for Graph Compressing and Embedding"}, {"paperId": "0af6f95e12161b4b1129371a2b0361cb47753b0a", "title": "RealGraphGPU: A High-Performance GPU-Based Graph Engine toward Large-Scale Real-World Network Analysis"}, {"paperId": "820dedf46024bc0dc7221cf2782119bae6949116", "title": "CenGCN: Centralized Convolutional Networks with Vertex Imbalance for Scale-Free Graphs"}, {"paperId": "072f1983569d0cf2bca954e41571124341afb482", "title": "RealGraph-Web: A Graph Analysis Platform on the Web"}, {"paperId": "b99ba20ef1396aa084f1138c7e61af517a6af9aa", "title": "Exploiting uninteresting items for effective graph-based one-class collaborative filtering"}, {"paperId": "57e391321cf7b22d879176b61bfd45b89efe7448", "title": "ASiNE: Adversarial Signed Network Embedding"}, {"paperId": "6319acd2290640c490fb21cd97ef887bbfeea4fd", "title": "Graphite"}]}
