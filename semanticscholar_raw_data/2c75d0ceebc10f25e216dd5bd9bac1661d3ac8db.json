In MicroMon, we introduce micrometrics, which is a set of fine-grained hardware and software metrics required to study the combined impact of heterogeneous resources on application performance. Besides collecting micrometrics, in MicroMon, we propose anomaly reports and concerted effort between the programmable switches and host OSes to reduce the overhead of collecting and disseminating thousands of micrometrics in WAN. We evaluate the MicroMon prototype on Cassandra deployed across multiple data centers and show 10\u201350% throughput gains in a geodistributed setting with storage and network heterogeneity.", "venue": "USENIX Workshop on Hot Topics in Storage and File Systems", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "", "volume": ""}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1468726581", "name": "Baber Khalid"}, {"authorId": "48793599", "name": "Nolan Rudolph"}, {"authorId": "3097141", "name": "Ramakrishnan Durairajan"}, {"authorId": "33383407", "name": "Sudarsun Kannan"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "964d0252477923a305ff9e91c96ed9bb2e61774e", "title": "Schooling NOOBs with eBPF"}, {"paperId": "646acf3a25f6d56d4e641e50b601b3bfc0e26c09", "title": "MEASUREMENT AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK FOR THE"}]}
