In addition to the availability of electronic patient records, we have approached a new methodology with the help of machine learning. The project is to develop an E-Medical Record Management System which maintains patients' medical records that can be accessed from anywhere using the cloud and suggests doctors according to the patient's issues/diseases. Diseases are increasing day by day, so it is tough for physicians to manually keep up the records. Even though patients are careless which leads to taking the check-up again. So our project helps to maintain records. In addition to this, we classified the patient's records based on their required attributes and suggest doctors which are implemented using Recommendation Algorithms(Content-based filtering) under data mining concepts. This system will give an effective and efficient solution to all stakeholders.", "venue": "2022 Third International Conference on Intelligent Computing Instrumentation and Control Technologies (ICICICT)", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-08-11", "journal": {"name": "2022 Third International Conference on Intelligent Computing Instrumentation and Control Technologies (ICICICT)", "pages": "193-199"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2188282646", "name": "Adline Freeda R"}, {"authorId": "2188288436", "name": "Anu Abarna B"}, {"authorId": "2233277878", "name": "Jahnavi K"}, {"authorId": "2125551362", "name": "L.
