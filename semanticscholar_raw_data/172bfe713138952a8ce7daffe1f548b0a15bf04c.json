We are surrounded by massive amount of data but starving for knowledge. In the era of Big Data, how to quickly obtain high-quality and valuable information from massive amounts of data has become an important research direction. Hence, we focus our attention to the data pre-processing which is a sub-content of the data processing workflow. In this paper, the four phases of data pre-processing, including data cleansing, data integration, data reduction, and data transformation, have been discussed. And different approaches for a variety of purposes have been presented, which show current methods and techniques need to be further modified in order to improve the quality of data before data analysis.", "venue": "2017 5th Intl Conf on Applied Computing and Information Technology/4th Intl Conf on Computational Science/Intelligence and Applied Informatics/2nd Intl Conf on Big Data, Cloud Computing, Data Science (ACIT-CSII-BCD)", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2017-07-01", "journal": {"name": "2017 5th Intl Conf on Applied Computing and Information Technology/4th Intl Conf on Computational Science/Intelligence and Applied Informatics/2nd Intl Conf on Big Data, Cloud Computing, Data Science (ACIT-CSII-BCD)", "pages": "241-247"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "52366010", "name": "Zhi-bin Guan"}, {"authorId": "2072498848", "name": "Tongkai Ji"}, {"authorId": "2067732973", "name": "Xu Qian"}, {"authorId": "2148984992", "name": "Yan Ma"}, {"authorId": "32509296", "name": "Xuehai Hong"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "682150e735c21a1baad596ace34011ef32698098", "title": "A Study of Challenges and Limitations to Applying Machine Learning to Highly Unstructured Data"}, {"paperId": "09a8ae8720cb0afa35cfd4b4c149cd5ae5c384db", "title": "Binary Classification of Customer\u2019s Online Purchasing Behavior Using Machine Learning"}, {"paperId": "69d1bf74cc2b5872c40900f8bc8204df6b69fc71", "title": "PrePy - A Customize Library for Data Preprocessing in Python"}, {"paperId": "3bccce47617ea58d6326ae40a2663c7b1f4aa577", "title": "A Step toward Next-Generation Advancements in the Internet of Things Technologies"}, {"paperId": "f0c2f86ec6badf6abe8ccfbc4cecf72d3a56f5b3", "title": "A Context-Aware Data Reduction Framework for High Velocity Data"}, {"paperId": "a7864712d3b99fc38b9f65ff3e2e5c099354a224", "title": "An overview of data reduction solutions at the edge of IoT systems: a systematic mapping of the literature"}, {"paperId": "0ac26567d9e08aac2fdc4e6ef8a0f1d76f578771", "title": "A modified genetic algorithm and weighted principal component analysis based feature selection and extraction strategy in agriculture"}, {"paperId": "02f36522287292fbd423b0af5d6864989ada127b", "title": "Data Preprocessing Techniques for Handling Time Series data for Environmental Science Studies"}, {"paperId": "22e9f7e4e58d065bea5fdd1ad3a6798f2554636a", "title": "Improving Classification Accuracy of Scikit-learn Classifiers with Discrete Fuzzy Interval Values"}, {"paperId": "87f23c26d469847f93735c9844264c901ebefd8b", "title": "The Impact of Fuzzy Discretization\u2019s Output on Classification Accuracy of Random Forest Classifier"}, {"paperId": "0bba8994a89ee1c26216b079594e90f58ad11e41", "title": "Analysis of Medical Slide Images Processing using Depth Learning in Histopathological Studies of Cerebellar Cortex Tissue"}, {"paperId": "1ffb2d0b97808b08a6dfa1f32257d5bc991549f4", "title": "Fog Data Analytics for IoT Applications: Next Generation Process Model with State of the Art Technologies"}, {"paperId": "5fd56c731c3aebaeba2eb7714bf2875954565416", "title": "Fog Data Processing and Analytics for Health Care-Based IoT Applications"}, {"paperId": "24b4ec47d0514726d457ee17820a2cff00d80ef2", "title": "Power System Anomaly Detection Based on OCSVM Optimized by Improved Particle Swarm Optimization"}]}
