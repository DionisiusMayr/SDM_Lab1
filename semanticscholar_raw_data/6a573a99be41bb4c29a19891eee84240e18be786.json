We argue that, for strong spin interactions, single lattice dislocations are forbidden by magnetic frustration. This leads to a melting scenario in which a tetratic phase, containing free dislocation pairs and bound disclinations, separates the solid from the liquid. We demonstrate this phase numerically in a system of hard spheres confined between parallel plates, where spins are represented by the heights of the spheres. In the tetratic phase, the spins are shown to be as antiferromagnetically ordered as allowed by their spatial configuration.", "venue": "Physical Review Letters", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine", "Physics"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-11-29", "journal": {"name": "Physical review letters", "pages": "\n          255501\n        ", "volume": "128 25"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2142553773", "name": "Daniel Abutbul"}, {"authorId": "5769091", "name": "D.
