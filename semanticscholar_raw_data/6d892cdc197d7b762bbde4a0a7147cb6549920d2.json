Recent trends in RSs have revealed a major paradigm shift, moving the spotlight from model-centric innovations to data-centric efforts (e.g., improving data quality and quantity). This evolution has given rise to the concept of data-centric recommender systems (Data-Centric RSs), marking a significant development in the field. This survey provides the first systematic overview of Data-Centric RSs, covering 1) the foundational concepts of recommendation data and Data-Centric RSs; 2) three primary issues of recommendation data; 3) recent research developed to address these issues; and 4) several potential future directions of Data-Centric RSs.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2024-01-31", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2401.17878"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2006853842", "name": "Riwei Lai"}, {"authorId": "2278970552", "name": "Li Chen"}, {"authorId": "2281983786", "name": "Rui Chen"}, {"authorId": "2278974832", "name": "Chi Zhang"}], "citations": []}
