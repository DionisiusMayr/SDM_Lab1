Clustering is one of the fundamental tasks in many science and engineering fields including signal processing, machine learning, and data mining. Although most existing studies focus on the clustering of nodes in static graphs, we often encounter time-varying graphs for time-series data, e.g., social networks, brain functional connectivity, and point clouds. In this paper, we formulate a node clustering of time-varying graphs as an optimization problem based on spectral clustering, with a smoothness constraint of the node labels. We solve the problem with a primal-dual splitting algorithm. Experiments on synthetic and real-world time-varying graphs are performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Engineering"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-05-11", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2305.06576"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2152647020", "name": "Katsuki Fukumoto"}, {"authorId": "2109757209", "name": "Koki Yamada"}, {"authorId": "2112766807", "name": "Yuichi Tanaka"}, {"authorId": "2627442", "name": "Hoi-To Wai"}], "citations": []}
