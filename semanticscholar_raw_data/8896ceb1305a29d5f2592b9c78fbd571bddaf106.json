Nevertheless, the network traffic and new demands from IoT users increase along with the promising of the content-centric computing system. Therefore, the satisfaction of QoE will become the major challenge in the content-centric computing system for IoT users. In this article, to enhance the satisfaction of QoE, we propose QoE models to evaluate the qualities of the IoT concerning both network and users. The value of QoE does not only refer to the network cost, but also the Mean Opinion Score (MOS) of users. Therefore, our models could capture the influence factors from network cost and services for IoT users based on IoT conditions. Specially, we mainly focus on the issues of cache allocation and transmission rate. Under this content-centric IoT, aiming to allocate the cache capacity among content-centric computing nodes and handle the transmission rates under a constrained total network cost and MOS for the whole IoT, we devote our efforts to the following two aspects. First, we formulate the QoE as a green resource allocation problem under the different transmission rate to acquire the best QoE. Then, in the basis of the node centrality, we will propose a suboptimal dynamic approach, which is suitable for IoT with content delivery frequently. Furthermore, we present a green resource allocation algorithm based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to improve accuracy of QoE adaptively. Simulation results reveal that our proposals could achieve high QoE performance for content-centric IoT.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2018-02-13", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing", "pages": "781-796", "volume": "8"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1443722910", "name": "Xiaoming He"}, {"authorId": "28014924", "name": "Kun Wang"}, {"authorId": "21941206", "name": "Huawei Huang"}, {"authorId": "1718215", "name": "T.
