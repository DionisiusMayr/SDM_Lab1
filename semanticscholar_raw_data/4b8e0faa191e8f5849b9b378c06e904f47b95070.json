In the context of recommendation systems, federated learning enables the creation of personalized recommendations while upholding user privacy. This paper introduces the \"FedScope Recommendation System\" (FRS) designed to predict next keywords. FRS leverages FedScope architecture which enhances the flexibility and enables the development of a tailored recommendation system. By adopting the modular aspects of FedScope, FRS crafts a recommendation system aligned with the client-server cluster's unique requirements. The proposed FRS serves as an innovative illustration of how federated learning can revolutionize personalized recommendations while maintaining privacy and security.", "venue": "2023 Second International Conference on Advances in Computational Intelligence and Communication (ICACIC)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-12-07", "journal": {"name": "2023 Second International Conference on Advances in Computational Intelligence and Communication (ICACIC)", "pages": "1-6"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3133807", "name": "Shruti Tyagi"}, {"authorId": "2284888773", "name": "Aditya Pawar"}, {"authorId": "2280401401", "name": "Ujjwal Kumar"}, {"authorId": "2280597972", "name": "Dhairya Ameria"}], "citations": []}
