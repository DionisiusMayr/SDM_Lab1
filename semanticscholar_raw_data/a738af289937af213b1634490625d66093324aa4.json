However, the public DRUG-seq dataset is too small to be used for directly training a deep learning neural network from scratch. Inspired by the transfer learning technique, we pretrain a drug efficacy prediction neural network model with the Library of Integrated Network-based Cell-Signature (LINCS) L1000 data and then use human neural cell DRUG-seq data to fine-tune it. After training, the model is used for virtual screening to find potential drugs for Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment. Finally, we find 27 potential drugs for AD treatment including Irsogladine (PDE4 inhibitor), Tasquinimod (HDAC4 selective inhibitor), Suprofen (dual COX-1/COX-2 inhibitor) et al.", "venue": "", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Biology"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-10-27", "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2145039040", "name": "Yetao Wu"}, {"authorId": "145508089", "name": "Han Liu"}, {"authorId": "2219213711", "name": "Jie Yan"}, {"authorId": "2148967021", "name": "Xiaolin Hu"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "fcd981cc0fb698d0f1835c61b865afb108cc3ba9", "title": "Hybrid neural network approaches to predict drug\u2013target binding affinity for drug repurposing: screening for potential leads for Alzheimer\u2019s disease"}]}
