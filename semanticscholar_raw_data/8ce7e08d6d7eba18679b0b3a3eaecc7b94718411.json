Traditional questionnaire-based methods do not provide a broad picture. To meet this need, worldwide interests in organic foods were studied by integrating query data from the Google search engine and deep learning methods. The results show that organic oil, organic milk, organic chicken, and organic apples are the most interested organic foods; people from Singapore, US, New Zealand, Australia, United Kingdom and Canada care about organic foods the most; consumers\u2019 interest in organic foods has no correlation with GDP and life expectancy but has significant correlations with other dimensions of culture such as individualism, uncertainty avoidance, and long-term orientation. A recurrent neural network (RNN) model structure is useful in predicting people\u2019s interests in major organic foods over time.", "venue": "IEEE Access", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Business"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2019-10-02", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Access", "pages": "147771-147781", "volume": "7"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "40913460", "name": "X.
