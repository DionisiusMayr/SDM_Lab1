Monitoring AM delivers benefits, as monitoring print quality can prevent waste and excess material costs. Machine learning is often applied to automating fault detection processes, especially in AM. This paper explores recent research on machine learning-based mechanical fault monitoring systems in fused deposition modeling (FDM). Specifically, various machine learning-based algorithms are applied to measurements extracted from different parts of a 3D printer to diagnose and identify faults. The studies often use mechanical-based fault analysis from data gathered from sensors that measure attitude, acoustic emission, acceleration, and vibration signals. This survey examines what has been achieved and opens up new opportunities for further research in underexplored areas such as SLM-based mechanical fault monitoring.", "venue": "Italian National Conference on Sensors", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-12-01", "journal": {"name": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "volume": "22"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2041295856", "name": "G.
