Federated Learning (FL) has recently emerged as a promising solution to collaborative machine learning challenges while maintaining data privacy. With FL, multiple entities, whether cross-device or cross-silo, can jointly train models without compromising the locality or privacy of their data. Instead of moving data to a central storage system or cloud for model training, code is moved to the data owners\u2019 local sites, and incremental local updates are combined into a global model. In this way FL enhances data privacy and reduces the probability of eavesdropping to a certain extent. In this thesis we have utilized the means of Federated Learning into a Real-Time Object Detection (RTOB) model in order to investigate its performance and privacy awareness towards a traditional centralized ML environment. Several object detection models have been built using YOLO framework and training with a custom dataset for indoor object detection. Local tests have been performed and the most optimal model has been chosen by evaluating training and testing metrics and afterwards using NVIDIA Jetson Nano external device to train the model and integrate into a Federated Learning environment using an open-source FL framework. Experiments has been conducted through the path in order to choose the optimal YOLO model (YOLOv8) and the best fitted FL framework to our study (FEDn). We observed a gradual enhancement in balancing the APC factors (Accuracy-Privacy-Communication) as we transitioned from basic local models to the YOLOv8 implementation within the FEDn system, both locally and on the SSC Cloud production environment. Although we encountered technical challenges deploying the YOLOv8-FEDn system on the SSC Cloud, preventing it from reaching a finalized state, our preliminary findings indicate its potential as a robust foundation for FL applications in RTOB models at the edge.", "venue": "", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2256535234", "name": "Ardit Memia"}], "citations": []}
