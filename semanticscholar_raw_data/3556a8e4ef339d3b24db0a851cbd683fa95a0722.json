Most of the studies in the literature are focused on single-layer ego networks, where relationships are treated as if they all belong to the same context. However, studies on multi-layer networks have recently highlighted the importance of considering the di\ufb00erent dimensions of real-life networks. In this study, we bridge the gap between the literature on ego networks and that on multilayer networks by introducing the concept of multilayer ego networks . Our goal is to assess whether multilayer ego networks feature the same structural regularities observed in single-layers ego networks and to investigate the role that the di\ufb00erent layers play in how people interact with each other. To this aim, we leverage a dataset extracted from Reddit, and we treat each subreddit as a di\ufb00erent layer of the social network. How results show (i) that multilayer ego networks are self-similar, (ii) that egos distribute their cognitive e\ufb00orts proportionally across their layers, and (iii) that egos accommodate multiple layers by adapting the outermost circles without signi\ufb01cantly a\ufb00ecting the innermost ones.", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "40493923", "name": "Mustafa Toprak"}, {"authorId": "144386157", "name": "C.
