Ensemble algorithms have been included in many practical applications to improve prediction accuracy. We provide an overview of three widely used ensemble techniques: bagging, boosting, and stacking. We first identify the underlying principles of the algorithms and present an analysis of current literature. We summarize some typical applications of ensemble algorithms, which include predicting crop yield, estimating forest structure parameters, mapping natural hazards, and spatial downscaling of climate parameters and land surface temperature. Finally, we suggest future directions for using ensemble algorithms in practical applications.", "venue": "Applied Sciences", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-08-29", "journal": {"name": "Applied Sciences"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2108353701", "name": "Yuzhen Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2108434581", "name": "Jingjing Liu"}, {"authorId": "2183520372", "name": "W.
