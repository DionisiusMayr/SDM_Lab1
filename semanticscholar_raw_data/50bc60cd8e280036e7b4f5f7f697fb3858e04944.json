Based on reading a large amount of literature, this paper has carried out the overall framework, methods and applications of its research. Comprehensive combing and elaboration. Firstly, statistical analysis and knowledge map analysis of the relevant literature on student behavior analysis in the CNKI database are carried out, and then the research trends and research hot spots are obtained. Then, from the different perspectives of the overall process and technical support of student behavior analysis, the overall framework of the research is constructed, and the student behavior evaluation indicators, student portraits and used tools and methods are highlighted. Finally, it summarizes the principal applications of student behavior analysis and points out the future research direction.", "venue": "Computer Science and Information Technology", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2020-07-25", "journal": {"name": "Computer Science & Information Technology"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2108396474", "name": "Weihong Wang"}, {"authorId": "47896873", "name": "Hongyan Lv"}, {"authorId": "2835146", "name": "Yuhui Cao"}, {"authorId": "2110833082", "name": "Lei Sun"}, {"authorId": "2068043022", "name": "Qian Feng"}], "citations": []}
