For efficient data utilization across multiple databases, the data analyst needs to prepare distributed queries in compliance with the complex regulations imposed by countries and organizations respectively. Before the prepared distributed query can be executed, it needs to go through compliance check for country and organizational regulations. Existing approaches for compliance check are inefficient as they are applicable for databases considering only one type of regulation. In this paper, we propose an efficient hierarchical compliance check method which is applicable for multiple databases adhering to regulation by country and organization. To improve efficiency a combination of country regulation checker and organization regulation checker is developed. The method first checks regulations imposed by country and then checks regulations imposed by each organization resulting in hierarchical combination. We show that our proposed compliance check method takes approximately 36.7% less time to obtain compliance status. Obtaining compliance status quickly results in increasing the interactivity of the data analyst for data utilization from multiple databases.", "venue": "BigData Congress [Services Society]", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-12-15", "journal": {"name": "2023 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (BigData)", "pages": "4754-4760"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2280897066", "name": "Divya Singh"}, {"authorId": "2280519114", "name": "Mika Takata"}, {"authorId": "2280665890", "name": "Toshihiko Kashiyama"}, {"authorId": "2280672743", "name": "Satoshi Katsunuma"}, {"authorId": "2280441813", "name": "Norifumi Nishikawa"}], "citations": []}
