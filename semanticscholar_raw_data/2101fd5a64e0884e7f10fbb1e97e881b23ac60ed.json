However, increasingly growing publications and the dynamic nature of research fronts pose challenges to understand the current research situation and sustainable development directions of big data. In this paper, we visually conducted a bibliometric study of big data literatures from the Web of Science (WoS) between 2002 and 2016, involving 4927 effective journal articles in 1729 journals contributed by 16,404 authors from 4137 institutions. The bibliometric results reveal the current annual publications distribution, journals distribution and co-citation network, institutions distribution and collaboration network, authors distribution, collaboration network and co-citation network, and research hotspots. The results can help researchers worldwide to understand the panorama of current big data research, to find the potential research gaps, and to focus on the future sustainable development directions.", "venue": "", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Political Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2018-03-01", "journal": {"name": "Sustainability", "pages": "667", "volume": "10"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "51463259", "name": "F.
