But, as datasets grow larger, new frameworks in distributed Big Data analytics have become essential tools to large-scale scientific computing. Scientists, who are typically comfortable with numerical analysis tools but are not familiar with the intricacies of Big Data analytics, must now learn to convert their loop-based programs to distributed data-parallel programs. We present a novel framework for translating programs expressed as array-based loops to distributed data parallel programs that is more general and efficient than related work. We report on a prototype implementation on top of Spark and evaluate the performance of our system relative to hand-written programs.", "venue": "Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-03-21", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment", "pages": "1248 - 1260", "volume": "13"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1746298", "name": "L.
