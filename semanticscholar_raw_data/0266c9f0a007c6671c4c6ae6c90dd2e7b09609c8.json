Big data has many benefits if it can be analyzed. But since big data is huge, it cannot be analyzed by an ordinary computer due to the lack of computing resources. Cloud computing has those resources needed for analyzing big data and can be accessed by everyone with only a subscription. Although cloud computing has its advantages, it also presents challenges for big data analytics. In this paper, we use a systematic literature review (SLR) for several scientific papers explaining cloud computing models, the technologies used for big data analytics, and big data analytics challenges in cloud computing. This paper explained three cloud computing models: SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS. We also talked about Hadoop and MapReduce; two tools used in big data analytics. This paper also addresses the difficulties of big data analytics in cloud computing.", "venue": "2022 2nd International Conference on Electronic and Electrical Engineering and Intelligent System (ICE3IS)", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-11-04", "journal": {"name": "2022 2nd International Conference on Electronic and Electrical Engineering and Intelligent System (ICE3IS)", "pages": "246-251"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2202018845", "name": "Warren"}, {"authorId": "2202020352", "name": "Stephen Candra"}, {"authorId": "2202019496", "name": "Jonathan Jason Joartha"}, {"authorId": "11053373", "name": "Jurike V.
