Large test suites may take too long to run frequently, and test case prioritization (TCP) techniques have been proposed to speed up the detection of faults. These techniques have become increasingly popular and the number of publications has grown in recent years. Surveys have covered most of the techniques, but the latest included only publications until 2016: interest is growing, and new proposals have been developed in the last three years. This paper aims to complete that survey by providing the latest developments in TCP to respond to this growing interest. Specifically we use the taxonomy proposed by Khatibsyarbin et al. on the most important publications from 2017 to the present day (2019). All in all, we found 320 papers in this period about test case prioritization. The results show that the main techniques used are search-, coverage- and similarity-based.", "venue": "ACM Symposium on Applied Computing", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2020-03-30", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 35th Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1419436645", "name": "M.
