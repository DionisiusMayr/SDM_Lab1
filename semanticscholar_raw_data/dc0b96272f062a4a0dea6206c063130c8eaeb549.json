For big data computation, the assumption that the data fits in main memory no longer holds, and external memory must be used. Therefore, it is necessary to bring the IO cost into the parallel computation model. In this paper, we propose the first parallel computation model which takes IO cost as well as non-uniform communication cost into consideration. Based on the new model, we raise several new problems which aim to minimize the IO and communication cost on the new model. We prove the hardness of these new problems, then design and analyze the approximate algorithms for solving them.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-03-24", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2203.12811"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "151485594", "name": "Hengzhao Ma"}, {"authorId": "49779773", "name": "Xiangyu Gao"}, {"authorId": "2180540450", "name": "Jianzhong Li"}, {"authorId": "2072688321", "name": "Tian-Hui Gao"}], "citations": []}
