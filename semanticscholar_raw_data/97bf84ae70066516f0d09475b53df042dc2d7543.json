Numerous researchers believe that BDA could provide significant advantages, despite constant battles with the constraints that limit its implementation. Here, we suggest an incorporated model to investigate the drivers and impacts of BDA adoption in the Jordanian hotel industry based on the technology\u2013organisation\u2013environment framework and the resource-based view theory. The suggested model incorporates both the adoption and performance components of BDA into a single model. For data collection, in this study, we used an online questionnaire survey. The research model was verified based on responses from 119 Jordanian hotels. This study yielded two significant findings. First, we discovered that relative advantage, organizational readiness, top management support, and government regulations have a major impact on BDA adoption. The study results also reveal a strong and favourable association between BDA adoption and firm performance. Finally, information sharing was found to have a moderating effect on the association between BDA adoption and firm performance. The data revealed how businesses might increase their BDA adoption for improved firm performance. The present study adds to the limited but growing body of literature investigating the drivers and consequences of technology acceptance. The findings of this study can serve as a resource for scholars and practitioners interested in big data adoption in emerging nations.", "venue": "Sustainability", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-11-22", "journal": {"name": "Sustainability"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1885047399", "name": "Abdalwali Lutfi"}, {"authorId": "1402847932", "name": "Akif Al-Khasawneh"}, {"authorId": "3251080", "name": "Mohammed Amin Almaiah"}, {"authorId": "1413130835", "name": "A.
