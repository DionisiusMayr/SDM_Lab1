Computational Sustainability joins this movement for a transferrable computational technique for sustainable development and a better future. Internet-of-energy (IoE) \u2013 leveraging IoT to smart grids associated with advanced analytics \u2013 is one of the prominent efforts in this regard. This paper presents a qualitative analysis on the elements of the energy and power management ecosystem in the United States. This qualitative study includes the Grid Overview of the United States; Weather and Climate and its impact on the entire energy generation and consumption dynamics; Peak Load Forecasting and its techniques and burgeoning challenges; Variable Renewable Energy, its reliability challenges and how we can take advantage of this variability; Commodity Prices and its criticality; Energy Disaggregation and its impact on consumption-awareness; and Generation Expansion and Decision Analysis. Besides, IoE integration, associated trade-offs, challenges, research opportunities and transferable computational techniques are addressed in this communication. Furthermore, schematics and quantitative analysis are presented in support of this study.", "venue": "IEEE Access", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2020-04-07", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Access", "pages": "69003-69037", "volume": "8"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2976993", "name": "N.
