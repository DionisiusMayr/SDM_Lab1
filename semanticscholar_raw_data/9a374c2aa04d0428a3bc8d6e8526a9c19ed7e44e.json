As the most promising architecture for deploying microservices, serverless computing has recently attracted more and more attention in both industry and academia. Due to its inherent scalability and flexibility, serverless computing becomes attractive and more pervasive for ever-growing Internet services. Despite the momentum in the cloud-native community, the existing challenges and compromises still wait for more advanced research and solutions to further explore the potential of the serverless computing model. As a contribution to this knowledge, this article surveys and elaborates the research domains in the serverless context by decoupling the architecture into four stack layers: Virtualization, Encapsule, System Orchestration, and System Coordination. Inspired by the security model, we highlight the key implications and limitations of these works in each layer, and make suggestions for potential challenges to the field of future serverless computing.", "venue": "ACM Computing Surveys", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2021-12-24", "journal": {"name": "ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR)", "pages": "1 - 34", "volume": "54"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2118275662", "name": "Zijun Li"}, {"authorId": "9221797", "name": "Linsong Guo"}, {"authorId": "2149023479", "name": "Jiagan Cheng"}, {"authorId": "1596812259", "name": "Quan Chen"}, {"authorId": "143824511", "name": "Bingsheng He"}, {"authorId": "1697293", "name": "M.
