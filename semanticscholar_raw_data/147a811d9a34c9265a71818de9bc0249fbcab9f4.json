Integrating vehicles, infrastructure, communication networks, and technologies create a connected ecosystem that improves transportation effectiveness, safety, and user experience. The Internet of Vehicles, as it develops, has the potential to alter the way we travel by bringing forth safer, more effective, and more environmentally friendly mobility options. Floating of emergency messages through Message Query Telemetry and Transport (MQTT) with acknowledgment aggregation under IoV is discussed in this paper. Broadcasting emergency warnings to all vehicles on the road is the most challenging task in IoV because of heavy traffic and dynamic channel conditions. This paper proposes an efficient packet-handling mechanism for MQTT with an acknowledgment aggregation technique.", "venue": "2023 International Conference on Next Generation Electronics (NEleX)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-12-14", "journal": {"name": "2023 International Conference on Next Generation Electronics (NEleX)", "pages": "1-6"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2284352755", "name": "A.
