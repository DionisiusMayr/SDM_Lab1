However, they generally suffer from reporting bias, the phenomenon describing the lack of explicit commonsense knowledge in written text, e.g., \u201dan orange is orange\u201d. To overcome this limitation, we develop a novel approach, Z-LaVI, to endow language models with visual imagination capabilities. Specifically, we leverage two complementary types of \u201dimaginations\u201d: (i) recalling existing images through retrieval and (ii) synthesizing nonexistent images via text-to-image generation. Jointly exploiting the language inputs and the imagination, a pretrained vision-language model (e.g., CLIP) eventually composes a zero-shot solution to the original language tasks. Notably, fueling language models with imagination can effectively leverage visual knowledge to solve plain language tasks. In consequence, Z-LaVI consistently improves the zero-shot performance of existing language models across a diverse set of language tasks.", "venue": "Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-10-21", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2210.12261"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2109409802", "name": "Yue Yang"}, {"authorId": "2087264100", "name": "Wenlin Yao"}, {"authorId": "48212577", "name": "Hongming Zhang"}, {"authorId": "48631781", "name": "Xiaoyang Wang"}, {"authorId": "144580027", "name": "Dong Yu"}, {"authorId": "2108276402", "name": "Jianshu Chen"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "6a1d85d1a73d2b80f8a61db62e9b64299eb2dd7e", "title": "Will GPT-4 Run DOOM?"}, {"paperId": "56d7c8ed197f14e70e5538981dc19509f326ee3d", "title": "GRAFFORD: A Benchmark Dataset for Testing the Knowledge of Object Affordances of Language and Vision Models"}, {"paperId": "5579a90486bc9d135e5967a6e9ea1ae352216cf0", "title": "Training on Synthetic Data Beats Real Data in Multimodal Relation Extraction"}, {"paperId": "5d8bd9709c0d26db0df03d1c3859adcfd8cf3a3f", "title": "Cross-Lingual Transfer of Large Language Model by Visually-Derived Supervision Toward Low-Resource Languages"}, {"paperId": "2d895c3153a80d281428a14d14ae121536fe790d", "title": "CycleNet: Rethinking Cycle Consistency in Text-Guided Diffusion for Image Manipulation"}, {"paperId": "f30331e65ca2d5245b1a69db6aca4cb3c5e28b9a", "title": "Training Multimedia Event Extraction With Generated Images and Captions"}, {"paperId": "03d8be9227a37ed1309f25ad786a4a6b5e19ac3b", "title": "ImageNetVC: Zero- and Few-Shot Visual Commonsense Evaluation on 1000 ImageNet Categories"}, {"paperId": "b908824639d18f11883abcab21efeb22e315ab9c", "title": "Multimodal Procedural Planning via Dual Text-Image Prompting"}, {"paperId": "bc0ee1c62b7864afd211e085fb3d58263c84ccfe", "title": "Movie Box Office Prediction With Self-Supervised and Visually Grounded Pretraining"}, {"paperId": "00a9a469bb019bf33eeee438c110f704b71cda73", "title": "Retrieving Multimodal Information for Augmented Generation: A Survey"}, {"paperId": "36d71337d5450f53179ebb069347bd8c85034a89", "title": "Localization vs. Semantics: Visual Representations in Unimodal and Multimodal Models"}, {"paperId": "8f2f6d90de822888ec4e283788bc09917018e9d6", "title": "ImageNetVC: Zero-Shot Visual Commonsense Evaluation on 1000 ImageNet Categories"}, {"paperId": "970a8ed9de244b080aa69dbf5996a37057909ca6", "title": "Localization vs. Semantics: How Can Language Benefit Visual Representation Learning?"}]}
