Our in-depth analysis shows that it leads to a chain of pitfalls in the system design and evaluation process, questioning the practicality of many of the proposed system optimizations, and affecting conclusions and lessons learned. We analyze many single-GPU systems and show the fundamental impact of these pitfalls. We further develop hypotheses, recommendations, and evaluation methodologies, and provide future directions. Finally, a new reference system is developed to establish a new line of optimizations rooted in solving the system-design pitfalls efficiently and practically. The proposed design can productively be integrated into prior works, thereby truly advancing the state-of-the-art.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-02-05", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2402.03548"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2283096264", "name": "Yidong Gong"}, {"authorId": "92702125", "name": "A.
