In the digitalization Era, the data that companies are looking for is no longer limited to their internal sources, but also include external resources such as Linked Open Data (LOD). Usually, these sources are composed of two components: datasets and data left behind by people while exploring these data (digital breadcrumbs materialized by SPARQL query logs). Considering the breadcrumbs in the process of DW construction represents a big challenge, due to their volume, variety and the expertise of users generating them. In this paper, we propose Crumbs4Cube, a comprehensive tool for discovering multidimensional patterns from LOD breadcrumbs. It offers designers mechanisms to manage, investigate and visualize these breadcrumbs before integrating them into a target DW.", "venue": "ER Forum/Posters/Demos", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"pages": "128-132"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1379972401", "name": "Dihia Lanasri"}, {"authorId": "2021973", "name": "Selma Khouri"}, {"authorId": "1379950565", "name": "Roaya Saidoune"}, {"authorId": "1379950578", "name": "Kamila Boudoukha"}, {"authorId": "1684379", "name": "Ladjel Bellatreche"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "177209eb9269d757b49753a07a0337bdb75e64a9", "title": "End-to-end solution for linked open data query logs analytics"}]}
