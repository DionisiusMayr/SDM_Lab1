In this paper, we perform a deep analysis on a newly released trace dataset by Alibaba in September 2017, consists of detail statistics of 11089 online service jobs and 12951 batch jobs co-locating on 1300 machines over 12 hours. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first work to analyze the Alibaba public trace. Our analysis reveals several important insights about different types of imbalance in the Alibaba cloud. Such imbalances exacerbate the complexity and challenge of cloud resource management, which might incur severe wastes of resources and low cluster utilization. 1) Spatial Imbalance: heterogeneous resource utilization across machines and workloads. 2) Temporal Imbalance: greatly time-varying resource usages per workload and machine. 3) Imbalanced proportion of multi-dimensional resources (CPU and memory) utilization per workload. 4) Imbalanced resource demands and runtime statistics (duration and task number) between online service and offline batch jobs. We argue accommodating such imbalances during resource allocation is critical to improve cluster efficiency, and will motivate the emergence of new resource managers and schedulers.", "venue": "2017 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2017-12-01", "journal": {"name": "2017 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "pages": "2884-2892"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1491233056", "name": "Chengzhi Lu"}, {"authorId": "2576616", "name": "Kejiang Ye"}, {"authorId": "2166236", "name": "Guoyao Xu"}, {"authorId": "144486540", "name": "Chengzhong Xu"}, {"authorId": "38902965", "name": "Tongxin Bai"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "9728ede5857315fc29d339626128e1a528e34401", "title": "EvoGWP: Predicting Long-Term Changes in Cloud Workloads Using Deep Graph-Evolution Learning"}, {"paperId": "1b5b962813407fc969bc55aec2b14874bfc57d5c", "title": "Collective Allocator Abstraction to Control Object Spatial Locality in C++"}, {"paperId": "b26c53faa9545069bc491b9c92f4a878ccb27eee", "title": "An Interference-aware Approach for Co-located Container Orchestration with Novel Metric"}, {"paperId": "502e90242d2d99d7b9d892e76d12f0ab932863d8", "title": "CARE: A Cost-AwaRe Eviction Strategy for Improving Throughput in Cloud Environments"}, {"paperId": "28eee6842a4e66ccde70950ac39d36c381afac9e", "title": "Telescope: Telemetry at Terabyte Scale"}, {"paperId": "38b6aee621a20b5b99f4140ac0d217db4333dd95", "title": "A Poisson-Based Approximation Algorithm for Stochastic Bin Packing of Bernoulli Items"}, {"paperId": "3b2be333c955ec15c241e6f34318c9886c1460bf", "title": "CEC: A Containerized Edge Computing Framework for Dynamic Resource Provisioning"}, {"paperId": "2c8bccb96bc922eb57d824b573a417e31597fa39", "title": "Cloud-Native Computing: A Survey From the Perspective of Services"}, {"paperId": "1c32ac0e1c8eb82b96a2161352fa7947259d7e87", "title": "Towards Increased Datacenter Efficiency with Soft Memory"}, {"paperId": "a106da34faf0f15e1d33622b52bc0816e37edca9", "title": "Unleashing True Utility Computing with Quicksand"}, {"paperId": "56353ea1da096d22a5d1d2748ad8f39bd388dbcd", "title": "Boosting the Performance of Degraded Reads in RS-coded Distributed Storage Systems"}, {"paperId": "798149831b639195bc198c2a5d12c94d222ac687", "title": "DRAM Translation Layer: Software-Transparent DRAM Power Savings for Disaggregated Memory"}, {"paperId": "89eef831b36deecaf7fc4d7de3a6d6aa1910c9e0", "title": "QaaD (Query-as-a-Data): Scalable Execution of Massive Number of Small Queries in Spark"}, {"paperId": "21e8cec7a5d04e73d2ec64572832cb7b51b95373", "title": "How Different are the Cloud Workloads?
