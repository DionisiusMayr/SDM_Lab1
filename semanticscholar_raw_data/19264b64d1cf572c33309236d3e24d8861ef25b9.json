This paper proposes a method of using English text summarization frameworks and Vietnamese pre-trained language models for Vietnamese single-document extractive summarization. The experiments were conducted with three frameworks namely BertSumExt, MatchSum, and CoLoExt, and two pre-trained language models namely PhoBERT and BartPho. Our models are evaluated on two well-known Vietnamese summarization benchmark datasets, namely Vietnews and Wikilingua, and achieved state-of-the-art results on Vietnews with a maximum ROUGE-1/2/L score are 57.15/26.23/39.76. The results on Wikilingua also show the effectiveness of our methods.", "venue": "Information and Communication Technology Convergence", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-10-11", "journal": {"name": "2023 14th International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)", "pages": "967-972"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2280931484", "name": "Vo Le Cuong"}, {"authorId": "2280930639", "name": "Vu Xuan Thinh"}, {"authorId": "2280928700", "name": "Vu Duy Thien"}, {"authorId": "2280929473", "name": "Vo Sy Hung"}, {"authorId": "2280930238", "name": "Nguyen Xuan Viet"}], "citations": []}
