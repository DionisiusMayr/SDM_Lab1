In the whole process of teaching and learning, a large amount of educational data is produced. Educational data contain a lot of information to be mined, which is helpful to improve the quality of learning and teaching. This paper will explore how to integrate these educational data that comes from different educational platform to guide customizable education which refers to determine the learning or teaching content independently. To realize the customizable education, the evaluation indicators and detail scheme to make use of the educational big data are proposed. The scheme consists of the acquisition, analysis and visualization of the data for different evaluation indicators. The purpose of this paper is to make these data guide undergraduates to carry out targeted autonomous learning according to their states to promote the learning progress. It can also guide teachers to carry out targeted teaching activities to improve teaching quality. And it is also helpful for teaching managers to have an insight into the learning state of students and the teaching state of the teachers, so as to put forward more reasonable teaching plans and countermeasures. This paper provided a whole framework for the application of the educational big data which can be extended by different educational institutions.", "venue": "ICDTE", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book"], "publicationDate": "2021-09-15", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Digital Technology in Education"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2090783", "name": "Huiying Cai"}], "citations": []}
