The latest traditional methods usually use the GPU full virtualization technology as an entry point to improve the problem of a single user and a single computer, so that a physical computer can shared by multiple users without interfering with each other. With this basis, this research study designs the novel multi-terminal collaborative distributed garden planning system integrating CG technology. Key innovations are: (1) The parallel SSOR-AI preconditioning combined with the CG algorithm is proposed to improve the traditional CG model. (2) The designed multi-terminal collaboration model considers the heterogeneous structure that will be more robust for the complex data. (3) The virtual image model is designed to finish the whole work flow. In the experiment part, the data is collected from Baidu search engine with the size of more than 1000000, the various tests are conducted to validate the performance.", "venue": "2023 3rd International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Social Networking (ICPCSN)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-06-01", "journal": {"name": "2023 3rd International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Social Networking (ICPCSN)", "pages": "787-791"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2222334369", "name": "Ye Wang"}, {"authorId": "2253854603", "name": "Qi Liu"}], "citations": []}
