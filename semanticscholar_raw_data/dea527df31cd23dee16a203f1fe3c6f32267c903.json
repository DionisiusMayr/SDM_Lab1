In addition to the common features of big data, the unique characteristics of spatial data make the treatment of big spatial data even more complicated. To facilitate developers creating big spatial data applications, it is imperative to develop new technologies to efficiently handle the massive amount of big spatial data. Given this impetus, the Korean government launched a five-year national project involving businesses, government, and the research community. The goal is to develop a platform for efficiently storing, extracting, processing, and analyzing geospatial big data. This paper explains the expected outcome from the project including the overall architecture of the platform, along with its current status and future direction.", "venue": "World Forum on Internet of Things", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2019-04-15", "journal": {"name": "2019 IEEE 5th World Forum on Internet of Things (WF-IoT)", "pages": "979-982"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2743423", "name": "Junghee Jo"}, {"authorId": "1851070", "name": "In-Hak Joo"}, {"authorId": "2115494675", "name": "Kang-Woo Lee"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "9f1c12181c0681df7405c21e0a98be2bfb0241ce", "title": "Prediction of Magnetic Pollution with Artificial Neural Network in Living Areas"}]}
