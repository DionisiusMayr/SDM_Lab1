C-Storm is designed by marrying copula-based dependence modeling for highly accurate inference and a highly-regarded parallel computing platform Storm for fast stream data processing. C-Storm has the following desirable features: 1) C-Storm offers fast inference responses. 2) C-Storm provides high inference accuracies. 3) C-Storm is a general-purpose inference platform that can support data fusion applications. 4) C-Storm is easy to use and its users do not need to know deep knowledge of Storm or copula theory. We implemented C-Storm based on Apache Storm 1.0.2 and conducted extensive experiments using a typical data fusion application. Experimental results show that C-Storm offers a significant 4.7x speedup over a commonly used sequential baseline and higher degree of parallelism leads to better performance.", "venue": "Fusion", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2018-07-01", "journal": {"name": "2018 21st International Conference on Information Fusion (FUSION)", "pages": "588-594"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2116575168", "name": "Shan Zhang"}, {"authorId": "1870303", "name": "Jielong Xu"}, {"authorId": "2108645803", "name": "Sora Choi"}, {"authorId": "144551170", "name": "Jian Tang"}, {"authorId": "1925309", "name": "P.
