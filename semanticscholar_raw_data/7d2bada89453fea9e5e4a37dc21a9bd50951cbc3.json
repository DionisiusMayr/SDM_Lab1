Apache Spark is a data processing\nframework with in-memory data engine that quickly processes\nlarge data sets. It can also distribute data processing tasks across\nmultiple computers, either on its own or in tandem with other\ndistributed computing tools. Spark\u2019s in-memory processing\ncannot share data between the applications and hence, the RAM\nmemory will be insufficient for storing petabytes of data. Alluxio\nis a virtual distributed storage system that leverages memory for\ndata storage and provides faster access to data in different storage\nsystems. Alluxio helps to speed up data intensive Spark\napplications, with various storage systems. In this work, the\nperformance of applications on Spark as well as Spark running\nover Alluxio have been studied with respect to several storage\nformats such as Parquet, ORC, CSV, and JSON; and four types of\nqueries from Star Schema Benchmark (SSB). A benchmark is\nevolved to suggest the suitability of Spark Alluxio combination for\nbig data applications. It is found that Alluxio is suitable for\napplications that use databases of size more than 2.6 GB storing\ndata in JSON and CSV formats. Spark is found suitable for\napplications that use storage formats such as parquet and ORC\nwith database sizes less than 2.6GB.", "venue": "Regular", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2020-11-10", "journal": {"name": "Regular"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2286550357", "name": "Kanchana Rajaram"}, {"authorId": "2205908613", "name": "Kavietha Haridass"}], "citations": []}
