How to transform massive data information into effective resources is the key point of big data technology research. This paper introduces the inherent laws of big data mining technology, determine and use valuable information data, which can open a new thinking and cognitive perspective, and it is of great significance to the development of the social economy. It can be concluded that the big data ecosystem based on spark platform and application of big data still have a lot of room for development, but there are also some problems. Nowadays, as a low latency cluster distributed computing system for big data collection, spark platform can provide more support for improving the efficiency of big data mining, but some of its methods are not perfect.", "venue": "Journal of Physics: Conference Series", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Physics"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2021-11-01", "journal": {"name": "Journal of Physics: Conference Series", "volume": "2082"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2111636622", "name": "Sida Chen"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "e1ee2e33a5fe30b0e789e379e2f5ce25d4c8eac5", "title": "Analysis of Spatio-temporal Behavior of Research Travelers Based on Spark Big Data Computing Model"}, {"paperId": "6430853cc37b2e01477727debabbbc6853be31a9", "title": "Prediction of Quality of Water According to a Random Forest Classifier"}]}
