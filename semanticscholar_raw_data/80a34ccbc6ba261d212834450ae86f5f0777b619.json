Critical agrarian studies offers some analyses of digital technologies, but rarely engages feminist perspectives, risking the repetition of problematic assumptions about scale, subjectivity and power. We draw from the strengths of feminist political ecology to think through three digital technologies \u2013 remote sensing satellites, agricultural advice apps, and automatic milking systems \u2013 that are transforming agrarian policy, practice, and social life. In doing so, we expand critical agrarian studies\u2019 approach to the digital by attending to situated knowledges, gendered labor, and emotional, intersectional, multi-species relations.", "venue": "Journal of Peasant Studies", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-03-18", "journal": {"name": "The Journal of Peasant Studies"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2244210217", "name": "Ingrid L.
