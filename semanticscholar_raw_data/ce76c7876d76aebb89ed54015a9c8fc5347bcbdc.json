To achieve it, smart city concept which employs Internet- of-Things (IoT), distributed software computing, and BigData analytics has gained widespread attention. Though, inclusion of QoS-sensitive routing has helped enabling better and efficient sensory or node\u2019s data collection and dissemination; however, ensuring optimal query-driven knowledge mining and information exchange has remained a challenge. Considering it as motivation, in this paper an evolutionary computing assisted K-Means clustering algorithm is developed for MapReduce computation in Hadoop distributed framework. The proposed method employs genetic algorithm to enhance centroid estimation as well as clustering, which as a result helped in achieving better clustering to support MapReduce. The proposed GA based K-Means clustering has been applied over Hadoop-MapReduce, where to achieve aforesaid centroid estimation and clustering enhancement Silhouette coefficient was used as the objective function. Here, GA-K Means was applied in such manner that it estimates optimized centroid and clusters simultaneously over Mapper and Reducer, which makes overall computation faster and more accurate.", "venue": "2021 International Conference on Computing, Communication, and Intelligent Systems (ICCCIS)", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2021-02-19", "journal": {"name": "2021 International Conference on Computing, Communication, and Intelligent Systems (ICCCIS)", "pages": "192-200"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1491355973", "name": "Kunal G.
