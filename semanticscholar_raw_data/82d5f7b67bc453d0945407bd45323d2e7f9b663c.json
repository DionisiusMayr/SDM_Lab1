It requires continuously aggregating monitored data across multiple source machines and processing them so to obtain useful alerts and insights. In this article, we propose a simple open-source prototype tool to perform highly customisable fault and performance monitoring across multiple Clouds. Differently from commercial tools, our prototype is simpler to deploy and it can be configured through a declarative approach, by simply specifying data monitoring tasks and aggregation policies. We illustrate such peculiarities over a use case relying on three datacentres under the Italian Research and Education Network Consortium.", "venue": "International Conference on Cloud Computing and Services Science", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"pages": "212-219"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2114885916", "name": "Giuseppe Bisicchia"}, {"authorId": "24788562", "name": "Stefano Forti"}, {"authorId": "30117328", "name": "A.
