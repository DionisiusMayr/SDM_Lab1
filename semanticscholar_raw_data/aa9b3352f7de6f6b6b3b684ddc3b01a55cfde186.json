Contextual information is essential for word sense disambiguation, but search queries are often limited to very few keywords, making the available textual context needed for disambiguation minimal or non-existent. In this paper we propose a novel system to identify and resolve term ambiguity in search queries using large-scale user behavioral data. The proposed system demonstrates that, despite the lack of context in most keyword queries, multiple potential senses of a keyword or phrase within a search query can be accurately identified, disambiguated, and expressed in order to maximize the likelihood of fulfilling a user's information need. The proposed system overcomes the immediate lack of context by leveraging large-scale user behavioral data from historical query logs. Unlike traditional word sense disambiguation methods that rely on knowledge sources or available textual corpora, our system is language-agnostic, is able to easily handle domain-specific terms and meanings, and is automatically generated so that it does not grow out of date or require manual updating as ambiguous terms emerge or undergo a shift in meaning. The system has been implemented using the Hadoop eco-system and integrated within CareerBuilder's semantic search engine.", "venue": "2015 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "year": 2015, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2015-10-29", "journal": {"name": "2015 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "pages": "1230-1237"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "34963860", "name": "M.
