This paper takes big data analysis and mining technology as an example, exploring the structures and characteristics of global science network of 15 representative global hubs of STI from 2000 to 2019. Based on the data of highly cited papers and methods of social network analysis, we find that the global science network has the structure of hierarchy, with an obvious characteristic of regionality. Based on the structures and characteristics of global science network, the knowledge flow and management model of global hubs has been proposed, which may be conducive to strengthening the knowledge management and network collaboration among global hubs of STI in other frontier technologies.", "venue": "Science Technology & Society", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-03-25", "journal": {"name": "Science, Technology and Society", "pages": "257 - 277", "volume": "28"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2112514431", "name": "Peng He"}, {"authorId": "1736802308", "name": "Xu Bai"}, {"authorId": "2212666762", "name": "Di Cao"}, {"authorId": "27107455", "name": "Jinxi Wu"}], "citations": []}
