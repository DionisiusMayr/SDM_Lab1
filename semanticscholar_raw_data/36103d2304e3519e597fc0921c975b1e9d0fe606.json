Collecting mobile big data is unprofitable unless suitable analytics and learning methods are utilized to extract meaningful information and hidden patterns from data. This article presents an overview and brief tutorial on deep learning in mobile big data analytics and discusses a scalable learning framework over Apache Spark. Specifically, distributed deep learning is executed as an iterative MapReduce computing on many Spark workers. Each Spark worker learns a partial deep model on a partition of the overall mobile, and a master deep model is then built by averaging the parameters of all partial models. This Spark-based framework speeds up the learning of deep models consisting of many hidden layers and millions of parameters. We use a context-aware activity recognition application with a real-world dataset containing millions of samples to validate our framework and assess its speedup effectiveness.", "venue": "IEEE Network", "year": 2016, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2016-02-23", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Network", "pages": "22-29", "volume": "30"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "34714099", "name": "Mohammad Abu Alsheikh"}, {"authorId": "1713586", "name": "D.
