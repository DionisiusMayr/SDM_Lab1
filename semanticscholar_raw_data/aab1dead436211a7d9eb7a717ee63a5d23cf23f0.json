To this end, we present a new practical task where only a few utterances of each fictional character are available to generate responses mimicking them. Furthermore, we propose a new method named Pseudo Dialog Prompting (PDP) that generates responses by leveraging the power of large-scale language models with prompts containing the target character\u2019s utterances. To better reflect the style of the character, PDP builds the prompts in the form of dialog that includes the character\u2019s utterances as dialog history. Since only utterances of the characters are available in the proposed task, PDP matches each utterance with an appropriate pseudo-context from a predefined set of context candidates using a retrieval model. Through human and automatic evaluation, we show that PDP generates responses that better reflect the style of fictional characters than baseline methods.", "venue": "North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-04-22", "journal": {"pages": "5114-5132"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2423429", "name": "Seungju Han"}, {"authorId": "3332270", "name": "Beomsu Kim"}, {"authorId": "1693182792", "name": "Jin Yong Yoo"}, {"authorId": "7274568", "name": "Seokjun Seo"}, {"authorId": "2163671673", "name": "Sangbum Kim"}, {"authorId": "3451729", "name": "Enkhbayar Erdenee"}, {"authorId": "50814662", "name": "Buru Chang"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "2c843aac13a5d7c361c511e8e4f5a9f176dfbdea", "title": "LMStyle Benchmark: Evaluating Text Style Transfer for Chatbots"}, {"paperId": "789c5dd71fb6085161931955339de2172539cdc8", "title": "Neeko: Leveraging Dynamic LoRA for Efficient Multi-Character Role-Playing Agent"}, {"paperId": "1beaf69026af98e7ad7a028b4ed8aebb06302d6e", "title": "Instruct Once, Chat Consistently in Multiple Rounds: An Efficient Tuning Framework for Dialogue"}, {"paperId": "7cddd0e4eed7238bceeff50f898772a228c10381", "title": "Chatbot is Not All You Need: Information-rich Prompting for More Realistic Responses"}, {"paperId": "5448496a160b2ba9d0a7c0e4d3fb20ff0cee17f2", "title": "On the Potential and Limitations of Few-Shot In-Context Learning to Generate Metamorphic Specifications for Tax Preparation Software"}, {"paperId": "5665885cb28bee7ba6869291180173078d3bd40b", "title": "P5: Plug-and-Play Persona Prompting for Personalized Response Selection"}, {"paperId": "751c100802012764a2c45e17e41fa219867b12e5", "title": "Better Zero-Shot Reasoning with Role-Play Prompting"}, {"paperId": "19c63eade265d8a47d160098d97194b3b83d3770", "title": "In-Context Impersonation Reveals Large Language Models' Strengths and Biases"}, {"paperId": "20ab124b3e1a5770c7816e2f78dfd5d64de447e0", "title": "Conversation Style Transfer using Few-Shot Learning"}, {"paperId": "b13668fe9c944b8ad441edb473c218d4cf303de8", "title": "Towards Few-Shot Identification of Morality Frames using In-Context Learning"}, {"paperId": "f1b475c6bde80880dd8edfc223c1f20c087201b7", "title": "Ethical Issues in Automatic Dialogue Generation for Non-Player Characters in Digital Games"}, {"paperId": "1c475acaa1060c8318a625f24bfd88c12f367516", "title": "Prompt Injection: Parameterization of Fixed Inputs"}, {"paperId": "3d5463a16d85d9d1d0d8ebb4117a31aca3c240ff", "title": "Fooling MOSS Detection with Pretrained Language Models"}, {"paperId": "11cf51c9ddf2a3debb26ca64165e6baa40143284", "title": "Generating Video Game Scripts with Style"}, {"paperId": "315b77bdb849b373ad26344080a62114e89d528e", "title": "Beyond Candidates : Adaptive Dialogue Agent Utilizing Persona and Knowledge"}, {"paperId": "1952bc9e3d07cffe5bcf74db6136f2b45490b2dc", "title": "Tailoring with Targeted Precision: Edit-Based Agents for Open-Domain Procedure Customization"}]}
