The historical ensemble portrays both the ensemble\u2010constructed background error covariance and tangent models more accurately, as compared with the standard NLS\u20104DVar method, with no heavy increase in computational cost in terms of real\u2010time operations. The online ensemble maintains the flow dependence of the ensemble\u2010estimated background error covariance. The ensemble analysis scheme proposed by merging the local ensemble transform Kalman filter scheme with a sophisticated sampling approach is able to adjust the ensemble spreads suitably and maintain them steadily. The updating scheme also largely guarantees the partial flow dependence of the historical ensemble. Experimental results using the shallow\u2010water equations demonstrate that the new big data method provides substantial performance improvement over the standard NLS\u20104DVar method.", "venue": "Earth and Space Science", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Mathematics"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2019-08-01", "journal": {"name": "Earth and Space Science", "pages": "1430 - 1439", "volume": "6"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "38683723", "name": "X.
