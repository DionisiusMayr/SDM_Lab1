The RO problem is challenging because it involves a set of decisions (the partition count, placement of parallel instances on machines, and resource allocation to each instance), requires multi-objective optimization (MOO), and is compounded by the scale and complexity of big data systems while having to meet stringent time constraints for scheduling. This paper presents a MaxCompute based integrated system to support multi-objective resource optimization via fine-grained instance-level modeling and optimization. We propose a new architecture that breaks RO into a series of simpler problems, new fine-grained predictive models, and novel optimization methods that exploit these models to make effective instance-level RO decisions well under a second. Evaluation using production workloads shows that our new RO system could reduce 37--72% latency and 43--78% cost at the same time, compared to the current optimizer and scheduler, while running in 0.02-0.23s.", "venue": "Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-07-01", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2207.02026"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "34553364", "name": "Chenghao Lyu"}, {"authorId": "2075309378", "name": "Qi Fan"}, {"authorId": "2059836888", "name": "Fei Song"}, {"authorId": "39753024", "name": "Arnab Sinha"}, {"authorId": "1891854", "name": "Y.
