Associated tradeoffs between availability and security arise at implementation, however, triggered by the additional resources (e.g., memory, computation) required by each blockchain-enabled host. This paper applies an energy-reducing algorithmic engineering technique for Merkle Tree root calculations, a principal element of blockchain computations, as a means to preserve the promised security benefits but with less compromise to system availability. Using pyRAPL, a python library to measure computational energy, we experiment with both the standard and energy-reduced implementations of the Merkle Tree for different input sizes (in bytes). Our results show up to 98% reduction in energy consumption is possible within the blockchain's Merkle Tree construction module, such reductions typically increasing with larger input sizes. The proposed energy-reducing technique is similarly applicable to other key elements of blockchain computations, potentially affording even \u201cgreener\u201d blockchain-powered systems than implied by only the Merkle Tree results obtained thus far.", "venue": "International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2021-10-01", "journal": {"name": "2021 IEEE 20th International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications (TrustCom)", "pages": "1093-1099"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "118960635", "name": "Cesar Castellon"}, {"authorId": "40066494", "name": "Swapnoneel Roy"}, {"authorId": "47322184", "name": "Patrick Kreidl"}, {"authorId": "145905625", "name": "Ayan Dutta"}, {"authorId": "1701593", "name": "Ladislau B\u00f6l\u00f6ni"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "ea5c946c8e84e047eebdbee2f28740fc2cb334d9", "title": "Navigating the Blockchain Landscape: Role, Challenges, Risks, and Issues in the Banking and Finance Sector"}, {"paperId": "29f6cc329fe4f9b6f41a8b7be2b4ab283d253f74", "title": "Hardware Accelerated Reusable Merkle Tree Generation for Bitcoin Blockchain Headers"}, {"paperId": "d40ebdc8597e7b8bfb150655dde75f48841e6e3a", "title": "Toward a Green Blockchain: Engineering Merkle Tree and Proof of Work for Energy Optimization"}, {"paperId": "1a4ead6341a2b217720b73e98199a2489d527c76", "title": "Towards an Energy-Efficient Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC)"}, {"paperId": "f9ffdbd151a34e9b41084093c0a8b652b76674f6", "title": "MTTBA- A Key Contributor for Sustainable Energy Consumption Time and Space Utility for Highly Secured Crypto Transactions in Blockchain Technology"}, {"paperId": "951b3011b2868a1a283518fddb8d6b6526d56710", "title": "Blockchain-Based Local Energy Market Enabling P2P Trading: An Australian Collated Case Study on Energy Users, Retailers and Utilities"}, {"paperId": "7baf40bfd0b72b2a0a3bd08350ba8ca4ea292c25", "title": "ENHANCING TRANSACTION VERIFICATION THROUGH PRUNED MERKLE TREE IN BLOCKCHAIN"}]}
