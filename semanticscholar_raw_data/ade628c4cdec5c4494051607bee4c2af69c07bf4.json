One of its drivers is to strengthen existing models to increase their predictive powers and help detect future defaults in advance. In this paper, we propose a new evaluation method to improve the overall performance of learning algorithms in the field of over-indebtedness prediction by using feature selection. Our objective is to find the most relevant subset of features related to the customer banking history for use in prediction model construction. Experimental results have shown that the proposed evaluation method is very useful to build a good predictor.", "venue": "2020 International Conference on Computational Science and Computational Intelligence (CSCI)", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2020-12-01", "journal": {"name": "2020 International Conference on Computational Science and Computational Intelligence (CSCI)", "pages": "498-503"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "52428049", "name": "S.
