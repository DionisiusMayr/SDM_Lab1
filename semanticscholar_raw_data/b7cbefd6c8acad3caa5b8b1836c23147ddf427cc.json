Existing systems also lack good support for compositional queries that seek events consisting of multiple objects with complex spatial and temporal relationships. In this paper, we propose VOCAL, a vision of a VDBMS that supports efficient data cleaning, exploration and organization, and compositional queries, even when no pretrained model exists to extract semantic content. These techniques utilize optimizations to minimize the manual effort required of users.", "venue": "Conference on Innovative Data Systems Research", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "102780514", "name": "Maureen Daum"}, {"authorId": "2089557481", "name": "Enhao Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2064928598", "name": "Dong He"}, {"authorId": "1718134", "name": "M.
