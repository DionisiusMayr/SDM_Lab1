Appropriate safeguards must be in place to ensure LLM outputs uphold the ethical standards of society, highlighting the positive role that artificial intelligence technologies can have. Recent events indicate ethical concerns around conventionally trained LLMs, leading to overall unsafe user experiences. This motivates our research question: how do we ensure LLM alignment? In this work, we introduce a test suite of unique prompts to foster the development of aligned LLMs that are fair, safe, and robust. We show that prompting LLMs at every step of the development pipeline, including data curation, pre-training, and fine-tuning, will result in an overall more responsible model. Our test suite evaluates outputs from four state-of-the-art language models: GPT-3.5, GPT-4, OPT, and LLaMA-2. The assessment presented in this paper highlights a gap between societal alignment and the capabilities of current LLMs. Additionally, implementing a test suite such as ours lowers the environmental overhead of making models safe and fair.", "venue": "", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2023-10-20", "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2249757539", "name": "Veronica Chatrath"}, {"authorId": "2249757461", "name": "Oluwanifemi Bamgbose"}, {"authorId": "2249757980", "name": "Shaina Raza"}], "citations": []}
