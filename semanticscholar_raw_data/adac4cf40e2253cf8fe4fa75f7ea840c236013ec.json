Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is one of the key technologies for realizing such management through software-based networks. Despite great benefits offered by NFV, deploying network services (NSs) in NFV ecosystems remains a challenge, especially for latency-sensitive NSs, as they demand stringent latency requirements and fast service provisioning. Specifically, service graphs should be embedded into an infrastructure such that these requirements are satisfied while optimizing network operator\u2019s objectives. To cope with the scalability of optimization-based approaches, heuristic methods are known as promising alternatives to find a satisfactory solution within an acceptable execution time. However, existing VNF embedding heuristics still suffer from the so-called causality issue, which may degrade the embedding solution quality. The causality issue means that embedding decisions cannot be optimally determined before all neighboring dependencies are known. To this end, we introduce our ${h}$ -horizon sequential look-ahead greedy embedding framework, which provides efficient embedding and re-embedding strategies to alleviate the impact of the causality issue. The simulation results indicate that our proposed algorithm significantly improves embedding cost, compared to the existing heuristic algorithms while being much more scalable than an optimization-based approach.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-09-01", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management", "pages": "2682-2697", "volume": "20"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "51058920", "name": "\u00c1kos Recse"}, {"authorId": "10379353", "name": "Nattakorn Promwongsa"}, {"authorId": "2770683", "name": "Amin Ebrahimzadeh"}, {"authorId": "134691496", "name": "Seyedeh Negar Afrasiabi"}, {"authorId": "2673320", "name": "Carla Mouradian"}, {"authorId": "2141385464", "name": "Wubin Li"}, {"authorId": "144571712", "name": "R.
