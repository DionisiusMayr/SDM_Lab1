Given the high latency and low bandwidth to remote storage and the limited size of fast local storage, caching data at the compute node is important and has resulted in a renewed interest in caching for analytics. Today, each DBMS builds its own caching solution, usually based on fileor block-level LRU. In this paper, we advocate a new architecture of a smart cache storage system called Crystal, that is co-located with compute. Crystal\u2019s clients are DBMS-specific \u201cdata sources\u201d with push-down predicates. Similar in spirit to a DBMS, Crystal incorporates query processing and optimization components focusing on efficient caching and serving of single-table hyper-rectangles called regions. Results show that Crystal, with a small DBMS-specific data source connector, can significantly improve query latencies on unmodified Spark and Greenplum while also saving on bandwidth from remote storage.
