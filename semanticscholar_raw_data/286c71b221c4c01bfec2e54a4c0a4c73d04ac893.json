Usually, this is addressed through ad-hoc, not easily generalizable Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) approaches. In this work, we leverage Bayesian Networks (BNs) to propose a novel probabilistic inference architecture that provides generality, rigorous inferences and real-time performance for the detection, diagnosis and recovery of diverse and multiple sensory failures in robotic systems. Our proposal achieves all these goals by structuring a BN in a multidimensional setting that up to our knowledge deals coherently and rigorously for the first time with the following issues: modeling of complex interactions among the components of the system, including sensors, anomaly detection and recovery; representation of sensory information and other kinds of knowledge at different levels of cognitive abstraction; and management of the temporal evolution of sensory behavior. Real-time performance is achieved through the compilation of these BNs into feedforward neural networks. Our proposal has been implemented and tested for mobile robot navigation in environments with human presence, a complex task that involves diverse sensor anomalies. The results obtained from both simulated and real experiments prove that our architecture enhances the safety and robustness of robotic operation: among others, the minimum distance to pedestrians, the tracking time and the navigation time all improve statistically in the presence of anomalies, with a diversity of changes in medians ranging from \u2243 20% to \u2243 500% .", "venue": "", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "1435352341", "name": "Manuel Castellano-Quero"}, {"authorId": "1414009243", "name": "M.
