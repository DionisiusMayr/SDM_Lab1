Sentaur supports a powerful data model that decouples semantic data (about the application domain) from sensor data (using which the semantic data is derived). By supporting mechanisms to map/translate data, concepts, and queries between the two levels, Sentaur relieves application developers from having to know or reason about either capabilities of sensors or write sensor specific code. This paper describes Sentaur's data model, its translation strategy, and highlights its benefits through real-world case studies.", "venue": "International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-10-17", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 31st ACM International Conference on Information & Knowledge Management"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2028613957", "name": "Peeyush Gupta"}, {"authorId": "144156242", "name": "S.
