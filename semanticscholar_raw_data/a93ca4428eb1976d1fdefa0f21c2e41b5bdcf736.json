IoT refers to a system of interrelated users and objects that are interconnected and have a significant impact on our lives. However, one of the most important challenges facing the ubiquitous adoption of IoT technology is security. In this regard, key distribution refers to the core process of setting up secure connection through a communication channel. This paper surveys the status of research until 2019 related to key distribution schemes in the context of IoT. Moreover, the classification of a key distribution is presented. In this study, we have conducted comparisons between different key distribution schemes in terms of memory storage, communication costs, and computation costs. Additionally, we propose a new taxonomy of symmetric key distribution while proposing a hybrid hierarchical architecture for the key distribution in the context of fog computing. Relevant observations and inferred recommendations are also given as one of the contribution of this paper. On the basis of these recommendations, a hybrid key distribution architecture is proposed to better enable new technologies of cloud and fog computing over IoT.", "venue": "", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "114388844", "name": "Orieb Abualghanam"}, {"authorId": "3222259", "name": "Mohammad Qatawneh"}, {"authorId": "1921183", "name": "Wesam A.
