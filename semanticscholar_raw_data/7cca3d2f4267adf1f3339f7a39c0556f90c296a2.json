The analysis captured five major themes in the discussion over SOM: illegality, art, promoting pedophilia, increase in offending and general harmfulness. Furthermore, the discussion was underscored by the central question of who is a minor, which feeds the already problematic definitional ambiguity and keeps the perceived discursive boundaries of the illegality of SOM in flux. Current study adds to the existing literature by presenting information that could be useful in designing prevention and awareness efforts addressing SOM and CSAM, particularly to the general public.", "venue": "Trames-journal of The Humanities and Social Sciences", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "Trames.
