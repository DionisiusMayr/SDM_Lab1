We highlight the recent advancements in cyber risk prediction, modeling, management, and insurance achieved in different domains including computer engineering, actuarial science, and business studies. The surveyed works are classified according to their respective modeling approaches, allowing readers to more easily compare the technical aspects of the surveyed works and spot out research gaps based on the research tools of their liking. We conclude this paper with a summary of possible research directions that are identified from the review.", "venue": "Annals of Actuarial Science", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2024-01-04", "journal": {"name": "Annals of Actuarial Science"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2278083818", "name": "Rong He"}, {"authorId": "2278326146", "name": "Zhuo Jin"}, {"authorId": "2244222034", "name": "Johnny Siu-Hang Li"}], "citations": []}
