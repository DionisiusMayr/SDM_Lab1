On the other hand, it poses many technical and security challenges to the users of those provisions. Fog computing makes these technical issues manageable to some extent. Fog computing is one of the promising solutions for handling the big data produced by the IoT, which are often security-critical and time-sensitive. Massive IoT data analytics by a fog computing structure is emerging and requires extensive research for more proficient knowledge and smart decisions. Though an advancement in big data analytics is taking place, it does not consider fog data analytics. However, there are many challenges, including heterogeneity, security, accessibility, resource sharing, network communication overhead, the real-time data processing of complex data, etc. This paper explores various research challenges and their solution using the next-generation fog data analytics and IoT networks. We also performed an experimental analysis based on fog computing and cloud architecture. The result shows that fog computing outperforms the cloud in terms of network utilization and latency. Finally, the paper is concluded with future trends.", "venue": "Italian National Conference on Sensors", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-12-24", "journal": {"name": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "volume": "23"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "39896776", "name": "Jitendra Bhatia"}, {"authorId": "2198571745", "name": "Kiran Italiya"}, {"authorId": "134251502", "name": "Kuldeepsinh Y.
