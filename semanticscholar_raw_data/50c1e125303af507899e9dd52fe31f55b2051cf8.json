The number of interconnected devices is growing rapidly, changing the very shape of the Internet. The IoT is already shown as a pilot of consistent investments for the development of new enabling technologies. However, numerous recent cyber-attacks have highlighted several critical issues in the security control of these systems. The implications of these types of attacks are often unexpected given the heterogeneous and physical nature of these devices. For this reason, basic resources such as honeypots are important, which allow to collect information about new attacks based on vulnerabilities not yet known. This study exposes some general characteristics of IoT devices, analyzing the state of the art of IoT honeypots. The study also proposes an implementation solution for a testbed used to collect messages that are exchanged by home IoT devices triggered by different types of interaction.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "40173618", "name": "Danilo Giordano"}], "citations": []}
