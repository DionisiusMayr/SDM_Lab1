These efforts often rely on existing, cost-based optimizers and cost models to avoid a cold-start, and build on top of the optimizer\u2019s decisions. In this paper, we investigate whether learning could also be beneficial in rule-based optimizers for known and unknown workloads alike. As a proof of concept, we use MonetDB, an open-source, column-store analytics data engine, and explore whether a learning model based on Graph Neural Networks that is trained on a cost-based engine, such as PostgreSQL, could improve MonetDB optimizer\u2019s decisions. Our experimental results reveal deficiencies in MonetDB\u2019s query execution plans, especially for queries with long chains of join operators, and potential opportunities in exploiting learning techniques.", "venue": "EDBT/ICDT Workshops", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2216575543", "name": "Antonios Karvelas"}, {"authorId": "2870466", "name": "Ioannis Foufoulas"}, {"authorId": "1695573", "name": "A.
