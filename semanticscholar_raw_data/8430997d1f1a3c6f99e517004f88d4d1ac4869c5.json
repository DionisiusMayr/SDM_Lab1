This paper proposes LogGrep, the first log compression and query tool that structurizes and organizes log data properly in fine-grained units by exploiting both static and runtime patterns. It first parses logs into variable vectors by exploiting static patterns and then extracts runtime pattern(s) automatically within each variable vector with a novel extraction method. Based on these runtime patterns, LogGrep further decomposes the variable vectors into fine-grained units called \"Capsules\" and stamps each Capsule with a summary of its values. During the query process, LogGrep can avoid decompressing and scanning Capsules that cannot possibly match the keywords, with the help of the extracted runtime patterns and the Capsule stamps. We evaluate LogGrep on 21 types of logs from the production environment of Alibaba Cloud, and 16 types of logs from the public datasets. The results show that LogGrep can reduce query latency and overall cost by an order of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art works. Such results have confirmed that exploiting both static and runtime patterns to structurize logs can achieve fast and cheap cloud log storage.", "venue": "European Conference on Computer Systems", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-05-08", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the Eighteenth European Conference on Computer Systems"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2111443421", "name": "Junyu Wei"}, {"authorId": "8274453", "name": "Guangyan Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2108539625", "name": "Junchao Chen"}, {"authorId": "2155654881", "name": "Yang Wang"}, {"authorId": "2225511", "name": "Weimin Zheng"}, {"authorId": "1812133", "name": "Tingtao Sun"}, {"authorId": "2118431978", "name": "Jiesheng Wu"}, {"authorId": "51460194", "name": "Jiangwei Jiang"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "f0c335cc7d8ecc7b6b0ee1a5516e32df658b1f35", "title": "Exploiting Data-pattern-aware Vertical Partitioning to Achieve Fast and Low-cost Cloud Log Storage"}, {"paperId": "ba002774f42f186d411d263c8a67b465a2aaf146", "title": "LogShrink: Effective Log Compression by Leveraging Commonality and Variability of Log Data"}, {"paperId": "c3bdc6149097fa186a17d07cff6ce210d468bdf3", "title": "Loghub: A Large Collection of System Log Datasets for AI-driven Log Analytics"}]}
