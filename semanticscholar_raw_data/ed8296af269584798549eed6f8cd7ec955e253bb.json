Data breaches and privacy concerns are only two of the major security issues that have emerged alongside this progress. As a result, blockchain technology has surfaced as a potential answer to the problem of how to make IoMT systems more secure and private. This all-inclusive study looks at the state of the Internet of Things (IoMT), the obstacles to its security, and blockchain technology. This paper offers insights into current research trends in the domain by reviewing existing literature that focuses on privacy and security in IoMT. The purpose of the study is to offer a comprehensive overview of the current best practices for safeguarding IoMT using blockchain technology.", "venue": "2024 IEEE International Students' Conference on Electrical, Electronics and Computer Science (SCEECS)", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2024-02-24", "journal": {"name": "2024 IEEE International Students' Conference on Electrical, Electronics and Computer Science (SCEECS)", "pages": "1-8"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2294766907", "name": "Sharwari Salode"}, {"authorId": "2294765107", "name": "Sakshi More"}, {"authorId": "2294764804", "name": "Janhavi Khodke"}, {"authorId": "2294768627", "name": "Sanchi Manwar"}, {"authorId": "2222544545", "name": "Saurabh A.
