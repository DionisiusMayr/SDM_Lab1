Relevant image characteristics are learned and verified with accumulated experiences during the reasoning processes. However, such type of process is highly dynamic and elusive to computationally quantify and therefore challenging to analyze, let alone to make the knowledge shareable across users. In this paper we study real-time human visual reasoning processes with the aid of gaze tracking devices. Temporal and spatial representations are proposed for gaze modeling, and a visual reasoning retrieval system utilizing in-memory computing such as Apache Spark is designed for real-time search. Simulated data derived from human subject experiments show that the system has a reasonably high accuracy and provides predictive estimations for hardware requirements versus data sizes for exhaustive searches.", "venue": "IEEE International Conference on Multimedia Big Data", "year": 2016, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2016-04-20", "journal": {"name": "2016 IEEE Second International Conference on Multimedia Big Data (BigMM)", "pages": "17-24"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3042119", "name": "Hongfei Cao"}, {"authorId": "2116612718", "name": "Yu Li"}, {"authorId": "38518917", "name": "Carla M.
