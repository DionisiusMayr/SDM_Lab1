Concerning critical infrastructures, people\u2019s privacy and the availability of IoT services, assessed with the standard Confidentiality-Integrity-Availability triad model, we investigate the cybersecurity of IoT from the perspective of System on Chip - the core physical components of IoT. The cybersecurity of IoT has been improved drastically in the recent decade, especially in the core of IoT - the System on Chip, most of them integrated hardware security modules for cybersecurity. However, it is still a challenge to design, run and maintain a secure IoT system.", "venue": "2023 10th International Conference on Internet of Things: Systems, Management and Security (IOTSMS)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-10-23", "journal": {"name": "2023 10th International Conference on Internet of Things: Systems, Management and Security (IOTSMS)", "pages": "66-71"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2268087664", "name": "Xianping Wang"}, {"authorId": "2268077965", "name": "Hao Qiu"}, {"authorId": "2041274795", "name": "Jiayue Shen"}, {"authorId": "2268176595", "name": "Weiru Chen"}], "citations": []}
