The operating frequency bandwidth of the design can be determined by tuning the proposed modulation parameters of the ridge in the waveguide. As a proof of concept, a bandwidth from 11GHz up to 29GHz is selected to force the waveguide to operate in single mode scenario to mitigate multi mode dispersion by simply adding a transition from ridge waveguide to a normal one.", "venue": "International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2023-10-30", "journal": {"name": "2023 IEEE International Symposium On Antennas And Propagation (ISAP)", "pages": "1-2"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2280747748", "name": "Defne Ata\u00e7"}, {"authorId": "49517027", "name": "A.
