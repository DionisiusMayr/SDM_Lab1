Therefore, finding how organizations can adopt big data components to improve their performance became a relevant research area. This issue is becoming more pertinent for SMEs. This study investigates the impact of big data adoption on SMEs performance by obtaining the required data from experts. The quantitative investigation followed a mixed approach, including survey data from 224 managers from Iranian SMEs, and a SEM methodology for the data analysis. Results showed that 12 factors affected the BDA in SMEs. BDA can affect both operational performance and economic performance, there has been no support for the influence of BDA and economic performance on social performance. Finally, the study implications and findings are discussed alongside future research avenues and limitations.", "venue": "Big Data and Cognitive Computing", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Business"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2020-09-21", "journal": {"name": "Big Data Cogn.
