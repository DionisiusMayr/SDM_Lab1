Prior innovation research has mainly focused on the opportunities for and challenges to infusing digital technologies into the innovation process. However, understanding the general effects of digital technologies is insufficient as their specific fields of application differ. AI is distinct from other digital technologies, given its potential to evolve into both a general-purpose technology and a method of inventing, and several firms are beginning to integrate AI into their innovation processes. We capture this phenomenon by introducing a concept we term self-innovating artificial intelligence (SAI), defined as the organizational utilization of AI with the aim of incrementally advancing existing or developing new products, based on insights from continuously combining and analyzing multiple data sources. As SAI is about to fundamentally change how innovations are created, this article describes the underlying AI technology; conceptualizes and outlines how firms may incorporate SAI into their innovation processes with the aim of developing increasingly complex products; and offers potential avenues for further research in this intriguing domain.", "venue": "IEEE transactions on engineering management", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-03-13", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management", "pages": "628-639", "volume": "68"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "152651804", "name": "Philip Hutchinson"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "d18ee1e0b7bfccef4021cac8873b72805644bc9b", "title": "Artificial intelligence and green product innovation: Moderating effect of organizational capital"}, {"paperId": "3f9d8c2ceb2a2020c456dc150fd00a7a77d44fe3", "title": "The role of artificial intelligence in\u00a0corporate digital strategies: evidence from China"}, {"paperId": "bfcbf7c173a67984ab1f84a366b90bcb9e302727", "title": "Unleashing the power of artificial intelligence for climate action in industrial markets"}, {"paperId": "17035cac990cf5c357cc7c5fd676430d892d2e11", "title": "Enhancing Innovation Management and Venture Capital Evaluation via Advanced Deep Learning Techniques"}, {"paperId": "af1dd5804fb3d3a8afd1259f57356eb6750f88fe", "title": "Revolutionizing Oncology: A Critical Review of Artificial Intelligence and Stem Cells in Cancer Treatment"}, {"paperId": "07eb02a586cf621c211e44709f6b2841a7dca412", "title": "Product Innovation and Value Network Formation of Internet Firms Based on Grounded Theory: Experience of the Largest Firm in China"}, {"paperId": "3251f45367f544cefda12d7d4e701e698647fea5", "title": "Exploring Technology Acceptance in Management Accounting Tools\u2019 Adoption in Public Sector Accounting: A Sustainability Perspective for Organizations"}, {"paperId": "71744dbbbbf73ff8104479ceaafac202645c94d4", "title": "Mechatronics: A Study on Its Scientific Constitution and Association with Innovative Products"}, {"paperId": "34e5bc20e0290499008485413caa25721d04087e", "title": "Artificial Intelligence Innovation Assistant"}, {"paperId": "a4dff2f3f4d91ead2599d67109e7aeee81d10ef6", "title": "Managing innovation in the era of AI"}, {"paperId": "5dc079cd4361661fb698466005bf0749a310acc4", "title": "The Innovation Paradox: Concept Space Expansion with Diminishing Originality and the Promise of Creative AI"}, {"paperId": "c583c7aabacb19e9ac14024d812dc4be819b1044", "title": "How to Bell the Cat?
