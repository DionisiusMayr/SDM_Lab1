However, much higher\u2010speed wind energy during the movement of the ship is often abandoned. Triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) that can generate electrical energy by scavenging ambient mechanical energy is one of the emerging energy harvesting technologies. By coupling the TENG and electromagnetic generators (EMG), a high\u2010performance rotary\u2010structured triboelectric\u2010electromagnetic hybrid nanogenerator (RS\u2010HG) is designed in this study. By introducing a matched inductor in the paired energy management circuit (EMC), the charging efficiency of RS\u2010TENG can be effectively enhanced by 15 times compared to that without EMC. At a simulated wind speed of 15 m s\u22121, the peak power of lateral TENG (L\u2010TENG), top TENG (T\u2010TENG) and EMG are 7.54, 7.85, and 22.5 mW, respectively. The demonstrated RS\u2010HG comprising two RS\u2010TENGs and one EMG can readily charge a 1 mF capacitor to 8 V within 15 s under the wind speed of 15 m s\u22121 and continuously power the electronic devices. Moreover, the RS\u2010HG can also successfully charge a smartphone through the step\u2010down and voltage stabilization module to further expand its application scenarios. The applications of powering portable electronics reveal the huge prospects of hybrid nanogenerators in energy harvesting and self\u2010powered environmental monitoring during navigation.", "venue": "Advanced Materials & Technologies", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-05-23", "journal": {"name": "Advanced Materials Technologies", "volume": "8"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "148373683", "name": "Xiaole Cao"}, {"authorId": "2217645404", "name": "Han Zhou"}, {"authorId": "2145925809", "name": "Yuxuan Zhou"}, {"authorId": "2218352983", "name": "Yiran Hu"}, {"authorId": "2146024920", "name": "Yuanyuan Wang"}, {"authorId": "2145029518", "name": "Zhongqiang Wang"}, {"authorId": "14459723", "name": "Qijun Sun"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "1644523d649ae6336c06deb1e74776ee778dc254", "title": "Fluid Oscillation\u2010Driven Bi\u2010Directional Air Turbine Triboelectric Nanogenerator for Ocean Wave Energy Harvesting"}, {"paperId": "a27fbde127044a45271cad5cf8edc68ed518abe6", "title": "Research Progress in Fluid Energy Collection Based on Friction Nanogenerators"}, {"paperId": "85bb4b3fc0286d31d0cd60c96b88e65c7607f820", "title": "State Evaluation of Self-Powered Wireless Sensors Based on a Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation Model"}]}
