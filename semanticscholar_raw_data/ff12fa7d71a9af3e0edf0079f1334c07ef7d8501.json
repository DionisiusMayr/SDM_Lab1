Accordingly, we are able to store and analyze a large volume of log data, which have been difficult to be handled in the traditional computing environment. To handle a large volume of log data, which rapidly occur in multiple servers, in this paper we design a new data storage architecture to efficiently analyze those big log data through Apache Hive. We then design and implement anomaly detection methods, which identify abnormal status of servers from log data, based on moving average and 3-sigma techniques. We also show effectiveness of the proposed detection methods by demonstrating that our methods identifies anomalies correctly. These results show that our anomaly detection is an excellent approach for properly detecting anomalies from Hadoop log data.", "venue": "", "year": 2016, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2016-06-30", "journal": {"name": "", "pages": "283-288", "volume": "5"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2429298", "name": "Siwoon Son"}, {"authorId": "2346228", "name": "Myeong-Seon Gil"}, {"authorId": "1752894", "name": "Yang-Sae Moon"}, {"authorId": "2744202", "name": "Hee-Sun Won"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "a11bcaa8ee9b28e4ed9b4d067bdf48f7a96f2539", "title": "IRFLMDNN: hybrid model for PMU data anomaly detection and re-filling with improved random forest and Levenberg Marquardt algorithm optimized dynamic neural network"}, {"paperId": "47b7e49c65384ebe1f4466a6dc3fe7245fe96a5f", "title": "Air Quality Index through Inverse Evaluation of Hazard Quotient for Public Indoor Facilities - schools, child daycare centers and elderly nursing homes"}, {"paperId": "26b1bcf5fbe58165d9242b61280fbc4f30d57f9c", "title": "Applying Value-Based Deep Reinforcement Learning on KPI Time Series Anomaly Detection"}, {"paperId": "f01a5d6b89df6b54583416ceef27fe73bd75d377", "title": "GenAD: General Representations of Multivariate Time Seriesfor Anomaly Detection"}]}
