These hybrid transactional and analytical processing (HTAP) database systems can support real-time data analysis without the high costs of synchronizing across separate single-purpose databases. Unfortunately, for many applications that perform a high rate of data updates, state-of-the-art HTAP systems incur significant losses in transactional (up to 74.6%) and/or analytical (up to 49.8%) throughput compared to performing only transactional or only analytical queries in isolation, due to (1) data movement be-tween the CPU and memory, (2) data update propagation from transactional to analytical workloads, and (3) the cost to main-tain a consistent view of data across the system. We propose Polynesia, a hardware-software co-designed system for in-memory HTAP databases that avoids the large throughput losses of traditional HTAP systems. Polynesia (1) di-vides the HTAP system into transactional and analytical pro-cessing islands, (2) implements new custom hardware that un-locks software optimizations to reduce the costs of update prop-agation and consistency, and (3) exploits processing-in-memory for the analytical islands to alleviate data movement overheads. Our evaluation shows that Polynesia outperforms three state-of-the-art HTAP systems, with average transactional/analytical throughput improvements of 1.7\u00d7/3.7\u00d7, and reduces energy consumption by 48% over the prior lowest-energy HTAP sys-tem.", "venue": "IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-05-01", "journal": {"name": "2022 IEEE 38th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE)", "pages": "2997-3011"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2675748", "name": "Amirali Boroumand"}, {"authorId": "33801185", "name": "Saugata Ghose"}, {"authorId": "2173743", "name": "Geraldo F.
