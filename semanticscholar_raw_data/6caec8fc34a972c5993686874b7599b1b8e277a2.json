First, we present a new Apache Hive-based data storage and analysis architecture to process a large volume of Hadoop log data, which rapidly occur in multiple nodes. Second, we design and implement three simple but efficient anomaly detection methods. These methods use moving average and 3-sigma techniques to detect anomalies in log data. Finally, we show that all the three methods detect abnormal intervals properly, and the weighted anomaly detection methods are more precise than the basic one. These results indicate that our research is an excellent and simple approach in detecting anomalies of log data on a Hadoop ecosystem.", "venue": "International Conference on Big Data and Smart Computing", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2017-02-01", "journal": {"name": "2017 IEEE International Conference on Big Data and Smart Computing (BigComp)", "pages": "377-380"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2429298", "name": "Siwoon Son"}, {"authorId": "2346228", "name": "Myeong-Seon Gil"}, {"authorId": "1752894", "name": "Yang-Sae Moon"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "fedff66ebf19f1ab1371b18342ae75fdca1a8731", "title": "A Comparative Study of Bigdata Tools: Hadoop Vs Spark Vs Storm"}, {"paperId": "c2b6828d12b083cdb63f327c81b7d497dd786277", "title": "A blockchain-based log storage model with efficient query"}, {"paperId": "7d92f6a3db10d99ac24027bd29fc27cd61d2e91f", "title": "Log Based Anomaly Detection: Relation Between The Logs"}, {"paperId": "e0b3ff12285588816fb8a7b5ca12cd1d9c99b0a5", "title": "Analysis of Hadoop log file in an environment for dynamic detection of threats using machine learning"}, {"paperId": "c4a0bf45a1c4a8d5181e97a3983ee7776d6786a2", "title": "EXPERIENCE: Algorithms and Case Study for Explaining Repairs with Uniform Profiles over IoT Data"}, {"paperId": "b1d22c1a51088b5f639c24cfa96a61bfe6450987", "title": "Review of Anomaly Detection Based on Log Analysis"}, {"paperId": "3cea60cafd52751c797d288aeac4f30425640a44", "title": "A Survey On: 'Log Analysis With Elk Stack Tool'"}, {"paperId": "6a34ab21c0ddfb60219969963d17566845db7a9d", "title": "Detection of e-Commerce Anomalies using LSTM-recurrent Neural Networks"}, {"paperId": "83404cf71d9a737469b1ae8550c126431fc0040d", "title": "Performance comparison of Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark"}, {"paperId": "e6e94223fe90c06374f78f5ac48c53c40650d473", "title": "Improvement of Kafka Streaming Using Partition and Multi-Threading in Big Data Environment"}, {"paperId": "a0a4b76b6c6e5baadd64516cb5f6df66a33da955", "title": "Anomaly Detection in Complex Real World Application Systems"}, {"paperId": "f10af7c517ee5dd1a34c0d39d9a60e9d3cd8842c", "title": "Potential threats mining methods based on correlation analysis of multi-type logs"}, {"paperId": "4f966fa67c38c92ba9ad1ad524c6b970c926f602", "title": "Malware log files for Internet investigation using hadoop: A review"}, {"paperId": "8453f80a6ca9f9b3d230d0102ec2dd32cd32e989", "title": "Survey on machine learning algorithms as cloud service for CIDPS"}, {"paperId": "8a3a8c59a02f737d79f9d6e981cccbf855c35561", "title": "Spark Based ANFIS Approach for Anomaly Detection Using Big Data"}, {"paperId": "b67e591327a7897c6f2f59b15b9682365ee2b5e9", "title": "Anomaly detection on a real-time server using decision trees step by step procedure"}, {"paperId": "dfcf1566bd48758d5605e6f49304d6ecc645579e", "title": "An Anomaly Detection Method for Metro Signal and Control Systems"}, {"paperId": "935ff8c2c20ccb520e170e68fc27c6774c761e90", "title": "Use of Machine Learning Services in Cloud"}, {"paperId": "4a52dfab707a50c141d9561070b51b8703249d9c", "title": "Ontological Based Approach of Integrating Big Data: Issues and Prospects"}, {"paperId": "c9b69554eba120d9d7a4e508437c267604e6d416", "title": "Model Checking for Data Anomaly Detection"}]}
