The presented system adopts the decentralized strategy for unlimited number of light poles. Through this study, an automatic light dimming system is introduced, designed and implemented. In addition, the collected data of load consumed power is analyzed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposal. The offered system overcomes the difficulties of analog light dimming and the short range of RF motion sensor detection by adopting a digital light dimming and offering the ability of using a sensor of short detecting range for a moving car on the street. The presented system can be used with unlimited light poles, in addition to its ability to consider different weather parameters like temperature, humidity and/or dust level for taking the decision of turning the lights ON, OFF or operate them in the dimming state.", "venue": "2022 International Conference on Electrical and Computing Technologies and Applications (ICECTA)", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-11-23", "journal": {"name": "2022 International Conference on Electrical and Computing Technologies and Applications (ICECTA)", "pages": "63-67"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "9415317", "name": "H.
