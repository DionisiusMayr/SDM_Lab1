The raw data in open conditions is always in low quality and is hard to employ directly due to its imperfect or missing records. Traditional data preprocessing methods focus on the offline historical data and remain a dilemma between the efficiency and the overhead. In this paper, a data harmonization service DS-Harmonizer is proposed on spatiotemporal data stream in the edge computing environment. Through the online cleaning and complementing steps of the hierarchical service instances, the records\u2019 validity and continuity can be guaranteed in an efficient way. On the simulated data in a practical project, the service shows high performance, low latency, and acceptable precision in extensive conditions.", "venue": "Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2018-08-05", "journal": {"name": "Wirel.
