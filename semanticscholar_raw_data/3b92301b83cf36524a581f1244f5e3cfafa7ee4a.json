Indeed, connected smart vehicles are technologies used for an SC\u2019s intelligent traffic monitoring systems (ITMSs). However, most proposed monitoring approaches do not consider realtime monitoring. This paper presents real-time data processing for an intelligent traffic monitoring dashboard using the Hadoop ecosystem dashboard components. Many data are available due to our proposed monitoring approach, such as the total number of vehicles on different routes and data on trucks within a radius (10KM) of a specific point given. Based on our generated data, we can make real-time decisions to improve circulation and optimize traffic flow.", "venue": "International Conferences on Networking, Information Systems & Security", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-03-30", "journal": {"name": "2022 5th International Conference on Networking, Information Systems and Security: Envisage Intelligent Systems in 5g//6G-based Interconnected Digital Worlds (NISS)", "pages": "1-6"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2213511537", "name": "Ikram Hamdaoui"}, {"authorId": "9488786", "name": "Mohamed El Fissaoui"}, {"authorId": "8573253", "name": "K.
