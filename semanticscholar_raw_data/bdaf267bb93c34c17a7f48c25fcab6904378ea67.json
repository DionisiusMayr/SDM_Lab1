As the standard TCP congestion control mechanism is designed for achieving \"fairness\" among competing flows and is agnostic to the application layer contexts, the bandwidth allocation among a set of TCP flows traversing bottleneck links often leads to sub-optimal application-layer performance measures, e.g., stream processing throughput or average tuple complete latency. Motivated by this and enabled by the rapid development of the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) techniques, in this paper, we re-investigate the design space of the bandwidth allocation problem and propose a cross-layer framework which utilizes the additional information obtained from the application layer and provides on-the-fly and dynamic bandwidth adjustment algorithms for helping the stream analytics applications achieving better performance during the runtime. We implement a prototype cross-layer bandwidth allocation framework based on a popular open-source distributed stream processing platform, Apache Storm, together with the OpenDaylight controller, and carry out extensive experiments with real-world analytical workloads on top of a local cluster consisting of 10 workstations interconnected by a SDN-enabled switch. The experiment results clearly validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed framework and algorithms.", "venue": "IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2018-09-01", "journal": {"name": "2018 IEEE 26th International Conference on Network Protocols (ICNP)", "pages": "209-219"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1691813", "name": "Walid A.
