As well as their impact on the organization\u2019s long-term sustainability, using the mediation of absorptive capacity and autonomy in R&D. Employees and the heads of the planning, HR, R&D, and technical departments of high-speed railways were polled for information. For data analysis, we used PLS-SEM, and then we employed mediation analysis. BDAC increases the organization\u2019s ability to tolerate change and gives management instructions on making decisions. This study adds to the body of knowledge on absorptive capacity development and autonomy over R&D activities by investigating the role of BDAC in the long-term development of high-speed trains.", "venue": "International Journal of Engineering Business and Management", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-01-01", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Engineering Business Management", "volume": "14"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2093573638", "name": "Muhammad Arshad"}, {"authorId": "2197899980", "name": "Chen Kun Yu"}, {"authorId": "2064968599", "name": "Aneela Qadir"}, {"authorId": "2056159207", "name": "Waqar Ahmad"}, {"authorId": "144593965", "name": "M.
