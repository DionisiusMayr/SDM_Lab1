Simple recursive querying based Spark solutions involve large data scanning cost and hence do not work well. We propose a novel provenance framework which is engineered to quickly determine a small volume of data containing the entire lineage of the queried data-item. This small volume of data is then recursively processed to figure out the provenance of the queried data-item. We study the effectiveness of the proposed framework on a provenance trace obtained from a financial domain text curation workflow and report our observations. We show that the proposed framework easily outperforms the naive approaches.", "venue": "IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2019-07-01", "journal": {"name": "2019 IEEE 39th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS)", "pages": "1443-1452"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2257264131", "name": "Rajmohan C"}, {"authorId": "2145722982", "name": "Pranay Lohia"}, {"authorId": "2257268899", "name": "Himanshu Gupta"}, {"authorId": "2066185801", "name": "S.
