Additionally, we calculate the sensitivities of future direct and indirect relic neutrino detection experiments and compare the results with the existing constraints, extending several previous analyses by taking into account that the C\u03bdB reference frame may not be aligned with that of the Earth. The Pauli exclusion principle strongly disfavours overdensities \u03b7\u03bd \u226b 1 at small neutrino masses, but allows for overdensities \u03b7\u03bd \u2272 125 at the KATRIN mass bound m\u03bd \u2243 0.8 eV. On the other hand, cosmology strongly favours 0.2 \u2272 \u03b7\u03bd \u2272 3.5 in all scenarios. We find that direct detection proposals are capable of observing the C\u03bdB without a significant overdensity for neutrino masses m\u03bd \u2273 50 meV, but require an overdensity \u03b7\u03bd \u2273 3 \u00d7 105 outside of this range. We also demonstrate that relic neutrino detection proposals are sensitive to the helicity composition of the C\u03bdB, whilst some may be able to distinguish between Dirac and Majorana neutrinos.", "venue": "Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Physics"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-07-25", "journal": {"name": "Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics", "volume": "2023"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "145747415", "name": "M.
