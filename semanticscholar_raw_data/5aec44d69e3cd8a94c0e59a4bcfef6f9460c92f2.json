Thus, an improved multilayer recurrent convolutional neural network model based on the YOLO algorithm is proposed to detect malicious URL in this paper. First, single characters are mapped to dense vectors using word embedding, and the dense vectors are participated in the training process of the whole model according to the structural characteristics of the URL in the method. Then, the CSPDarknet neural network model based on the improved YOLO algorithm is proposed to extract features of the URL. Finally, the extracted features are used to evaluate malicious URL by the bidirectional LSTM recurrent neural network algorithm. In order to verify the validity of the algorithm, a total of 200,000 URLs are collected, including 100,000 normal URLs labeled \u201cgood\u201d and 100,000 malicious URLs labeled \u201cbad\u201d. The experimental results show that the method detects malicious URLs more quickly and effectively and has high accuracy, high recall rate, and high accuracy compared with Text-RCNN, BRNN, and other models.", "venue": "Secur.
