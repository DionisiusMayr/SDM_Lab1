Nonetheless, the model still has room for improvement. To this end, we examine BlenderBot 2.0 limitations and errors from three perspectives: model, data, and user. From the data point of view, we highlight the unclear guidelines provided to workers during the crowdsourcing process, as well as a lack of a process for refining hate speech in the collected data and verifying the accuracy of internet-based information. From a user perspective, we identify nine types of limitations of BlenderBot 2.0, and their causes are thoroughly investigated. Furthermore, for each point of view, we propose practical improvement methods and discuss several potential future research directions.", "venue": "", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-01-10", "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "1800111", "name": "Jungseob Lee"}, {"authorId": "2135165000", "name": "Midan Shim"}, {"authorId": "2087630963", "name": "Suhyune Son"}, {"authorId": "2140329951", "name": "Chanjun Park"}, {"authorId": "2155859414", "name": "Yujin Kim"}, {"authorId": "83056580", "name": "Heu-Jeoung Lim"}], "citations": []}
