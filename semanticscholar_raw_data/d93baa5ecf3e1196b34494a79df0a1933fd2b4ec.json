The performances of existing action localization approaches remain unsatisfactory in precisely determining the beginning and the end of an action. Imitating the human perception procedure with observations and refinements, we propose a novel three-phase action localization framework. Our framework is embedded with an Actionness Network to generate initial proposals through frame-wise similarity grouping, and then a Refinement Network to conduct boundary adjustment on these proposals. Finally, the refined proposals are sent to a Localization Network for further fine-grained location regression. The whole process can be deemed as multi-stage refinement using a novel non-local pyramid feature under various temporal granularities. We evaluate our framework on THUMOS14 benchmark and obtain a significant improvement over the state-of-the-arts approaches. Specifically, the performance gain is remarkable under precise localization with high IoU thresholds. Our proposed framework achieves mAP@IoU=0.5 of 34.2%.", "venue": "International Conference on Multimedia Retrieval", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book"], "publicationDate": "2018-04-13", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 2018 ACM on International Conference on Multimedia Retrieval"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "31567595", "name": "Haonan Qiu"}, {"authorId": "3015119", "name": "Yingbin Zheng"}, {"authorId": "151486061", "name": "Hao Ye"}, {"authorId": "2143370796", "name": "Yao Lu"}, {"authorId": "2145755949", "name": "Feng Wang"}, {"authorId": "145836225", "name": "Liang He"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "e8c13899d66cbb3150b8adce53e972088d983ede", "title": "RefineTAD: Learning Proposal-free Refinement for Temporal Action Detection"}, {"paperId": "52c936a187bb6b089ed56f65d01052137bb42404", "title": "Self-Feedback DETR for Temporal Action Detection"}, {"paperId": "b9a5e200fa07cb598e8f78088588d4249f2c7553", "title": "A Review of Video Action Detection Based on Deep Learning"}, {"paperId": "0124ba58ded10894a5a9011965ba4f827d8abd7e", "title": "Research on Offline Classification and Counting Algorithm of Long Fitness Video"}, {"paperId": "4e29525a8ceec43de6bd075a690b73e6cd53fb62", "title": "TN-ZSTAD: Transferable Network for Zero-Shot Temporal Activity Detection"}, {"paperId": "19b054d1a0aa6d0d8160b545f719c9f8fc106ede", "title": "Fine-grained action segmentation based on complementary Frame-level Classification Model and Action-wise Regression Model"}, {"paperId": "23e0731c87eaf87115177ecdd337edf80c4e222f", "title": "Class Semantics-based Attention for Action Detection"}, {"paperId": "1a01d6eafbd2a5e0ad554006b4f7656bb23079f3", "title": "Temporal action localization using gated recurrent units"}, {"paperId": "bbaa65066b9f7f7ccdfb5ec0e104a03bff069461", "title": "A practical framework of multi-person 3D human pose estimation with a single RGB camera"}, {"paperId": "208a14388a5d62b8eb343ea29a684e95d27643b4", "title": "Feature Pyramid Hierarchies for Multi-scale Temporal Action Detection"}, {"paperId": "b2ac305cee3d7f49002aaab1b214836dc4a5af90", "title": "Temporal Action Detection based on Temporal Deformable Proposal Generation"}, {"paperId": "0bb007363de89dcd923545464cdce9467b32c931", "title": "TSP: Temporally-Sensitive Pretraining of Video Encoders for Localization Tasks"}, {"paperId": "20a84646f5f38ae7f7148b81f0924640807e2b19", "title": "Vectors of temporally correlated snippets for temporal action detection"}, {"paperId": "ed38ab8511cd7f6a202730bfd3de566c3622562f", "title": "Interactivity Proposals for Surveillance Videos"}, {"paperId": "5a5a491cb632abc75eaec550c4fd7206949e628b", "title": "Progressive Boundary Refinement Network for Temporal Action Detection"}, {"paperId": "13aa627f35de78af64d1861fceb97c834a769b05", "title": "SRG: Snippet Relatedness-Based Temporal Action Proposal Generator"}, {"paperId": "46e9f9c38d93e7882ae82d81e007ae8eb9ab6462", "title": "Learning Weighted Video Segments for Temporal Action Localization"}, {"paperId": "f1db07ce91065594751cd51d31f086bc02d42968", "title": "Learning Coarse and Fine Features for Precise Temporal Action Localization"}, {"paperId": "4a43026d85dd4f377cd9e62ed2bdaa7bcbb3ccba", "title": "An Unsupervised Framework for Online Spatiotemporal Detection of Activities of Daily Living by Hierarchical Activity Models"}, {"paperId": "cd5e49eb51940a5d1555f40486d6b31534c13786", "title": "Self-Attention Temporal Convolutional Network for Long-Term Daily Living Activity Detection"}, {"paperId": "3917d925dac0abf6e7b452fa2916c25f9e72fc2c", "title": "TAB: Temporally aggregated bag-of-discriminant-words for temporal action proposals"}, {"paperId": "afa59eb5fedbcabc895ca7b43d6669ad9bbeda87", "title": "End-to-End Temporal Action Detection Using Bag of Discriminant Snippets"}, {"paperId": "8889beea3ae4e529f888525e33bd2160559f9153", "title": "Temporal Cricket Stroke Localization from Untrimmed Highlight Videos"}, {"paperId": "6eee0fd08e8b33bf2affb355a6ecd3523860aa11", "title": "Action recognition in videos"}, {"paperId": "40dd38de26834c7d6da8607c6d55a52d0db9e2ba", "title": "Exploiting Informative Video Segments for Temporal Action Localization"}, {"paperId": "7ef08e17c70ca985a7b073d81466375ecc6fc50c", "title": "Temporal Action Localization With Coarse-to-Fine Network"}, {"paperId": "ecab04347e67d0e82b582d7bd752b91e4e01a4b2", "title": "AFNet: Temporal Locality-Aware Network With Dual Structure for Accurate and Fast Action Detection"}, {"paperId": "6a73ed2d412f2f1a57e400c6f1722f69cf9fcd13", "title": "A Survey on Temporal Action Localization"}]}
