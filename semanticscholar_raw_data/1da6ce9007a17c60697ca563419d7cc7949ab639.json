Resource disaggregation allows compute and memory resources to be allocated individually as required to each workload. However, it is unclear how to efficiently realize this capability and cost-effectively meet the stringent bandwidth and latency requirements of HPC applications. To that end, we describe how modern photonics can be co-designed with modern HPC racks to implement flexible intra-rack resource disaggregation and fully meet the bit error rate (BER) and high escape bandwidth of all chip types in modern HPC racks. Our photonic-based disaggregated rack provides an average application speedup of 11% (46% maximum) for 25 CPU and 61% for 24 GPU benchmarks compared to a similar system that instead uses modern electronic switches for disaggregation. Using observed resource usage from a production system, we estimate that an iso-performance intra-rack disaggregated HPC system using photonics would require 4\u00d7 fewer memory modules and 2\u00d7 fewer NICs than a non-disaggregated baseline.", "venue": "IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-01-09", "journal": {"name": "2023 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing (CLUSTER)", "pages": "158-172"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1900699", "name": "George Michelogiannakis"}, {"authorId": "51109929", "name": "Yehia Arafa"}, {"authorId": "146249764", "name": "B.
