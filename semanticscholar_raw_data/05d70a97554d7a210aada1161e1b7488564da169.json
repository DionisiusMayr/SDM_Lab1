The underlying idea is to combine the benefits of different data stores behind a predefined set of common interfaces and thus address use cases that individual stores cannot meet. This can be accomplished using different approaches which vary greatly in terms of capabilities, functionality, and architectural concepts. This tutorial provides a detailed overview of the current state of research in polyglot data management. We motivate its use by showing the high diversity of existing data stores and discussing three use cases in which individual stores are insufficient. Thereafter, we present different taxonomies for classifying polyglot data systems and give a detailed review of a number of selected systems. Finally, we compare these systems based on their features and discuss open challenges that still need to be addressed in future research.", "venue": "Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-08-01", "journal": {"name": "Proc.
