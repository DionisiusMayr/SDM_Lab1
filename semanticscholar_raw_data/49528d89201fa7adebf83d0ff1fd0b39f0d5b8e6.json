Surprisingly, for the dynamic setting, almost nothing was known until recently. In SODA'18, Bhattacharya, Chakrabarty, Henzinger and Nanongkai devised a randomized data structure for maintaining a $(\\Delta+1)$-coloring with $O(\\log \\Delta)$ expected amortized update time. In this paper, we present a $(\\Delta+1)$-coloring data structure that achieves a constant amortized update time and show that this time bound holds not only in expectation but also with high probability.", "venue": "", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2019-10-04", "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "3074832", "name": "Sayan Bhattacharya"}, {"authorId": "145717044", "name": "F.
