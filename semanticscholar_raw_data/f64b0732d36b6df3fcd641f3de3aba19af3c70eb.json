Our first concern is adequacy and soundness of $\\lambda^*_{\\mathsf{G}}$, which we derive from a direct-style imperative functional language (a variant of Bao et al.'s $\\lambda^*$-calculus with reachability types and a simple effect system) by a series of type-preserving translations into a calculus in monadic normalform (MNF). Static reachability types and effects entirely inform $\\lambda^*_{\\mathsf{G}}$'s dependency synthesis. We argue for its adequacy by proving its functional properties along with dependency safety via progress and preservation lemmas with respect to a notion of call-by-value (CBV) reduction that checks the observed order of effects. Our second concern is establishing the correctness of $\\lambda^*_{\\mathsf{G}}$'s equational rules that drive compiler optimizations (e.g., DCE, $\\lambda$-hoisting, etc.), by proving contextual equivalence using logical relations. A key insight is that the functional properties of dependency synthesis permit a logical relation on $\\lambda^*_{\\mathsf{G}}$ in MNF in terms of previously developed logical relations for the direct-style $\\lambda^*$-calculus. Finally, we also include a longer version of the conference paper's section on code generation and code motion for $\\lambda^*_{\\mathsf{G}}$ as implemented in Scala~LMS.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-09-15", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2309.08118"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2086627", "name": "Oliver Bra\u010devac"}, {"authorId": "2113006", "name": "Guannan Wei"}, {"authorId": "2242702445", "name": "Songlin Jia"}, {"authorId": "51428583", "name": "Supun Abeysinghe"}, {"authorId": "2170775479", "name": "Yuxuan Jiang"}, {"authorId": "2239105953", "name": "Yuyan Bao"}, {"authorId": "1712987", "name": "Tiark Rompf"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "b88cac3ad1e609b5734c3b16fe316e6b41a79a55", "title": "Graph IRs for Impure Higher-Order Languages: Making Aggressive Optimizations Affordable with Precise Effect Dependencies"}, {"paperId": "770911d314dd7866153f2be235607c0eb32255bf", "title": "Rhyme: A Data-Centric Expressive Query Language for Nested Data Structures"}]}
