Distributed data-processing workloads executing in parallel take advantages of resource sharing, fast delivery, and excellent portability of containerization, but also suffer from resource competition and performance interference. Especially for memory virtualization, data-processing frameworks allocate physical memory (i.e., RAM) and swap to applications specified by users, without considering cache-characteristics and parallelism of applications, which induces performance degradation and significantly protracted latency which is worse given over-provisioning. We design an efficient memory allocation scheme (RITA) for containerized parallel systems to improve data processing latency. RITA monitors memory usage and cache characteristics of applications, and dynamically re-allocates memory resources. We implement RITA in a real-world system, which can easily migrate to other container-based virtualization environments. Our experimental results show that RITA provides remarkable latency improvement for memory intensive distributed data-processing workloads.", "venue": "IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2020-10-01", "journal": {"name": "2020 IEEE 13th International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD)", "pages": "329-336"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1486100460", "name": "Danlin Jia"}, {"authorId": "48001723", "name": "Mahsa Bayati"}, {"authorId": "2110753930", "name": "Ron Lee"}, {"authorId": "145154819", "name": "N.
