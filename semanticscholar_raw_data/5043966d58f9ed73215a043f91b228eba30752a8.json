As one of the businesses with an ecosystem that contributes to data growth, banks have challenges in generating insight. A high level of data security is frequently linked to a high level of data access difficulties. This poses a challenge to the implementation of data-driven business, where taking control of our data is one of the best ways to ensure that we not only own data but also have the ability to process and use data to extract business value. Through literature review, a number of challenges to optimizing the implementation of big data analytics in the banking industry were discovered. Data governance refers to the methods and procedures that assist banks in managing and securing data. A big data architecture is presented to address the highlighted issues, particularly with a multi-tiered approach to big data structures. With the adoption of this architecture, it will be simpler to generate business-value-generating insights for the banking industry using big data with accessibility and protection of data.", "venue": "2023 International Conference on Computer Science, Information Technology and Engineering (ICCoSITE)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-02-16", "journal": {"name": "2023 International Conference on Computer Science, Information Technology and Engineering (ICCoSITE)", "pages": "667-672"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2219165350", "name": "Idha Kristiana"}, {"authorId": "65955539", "name": "M.
