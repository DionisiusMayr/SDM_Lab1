On the other hand, several NoSQL databases used in Big Data applications use a new model appropriate to their requirements for structure, speed, and large amount of data. This model protects each individual cell in key-value databases by labeling them with authorization rights following a Role-Based Access Control model or similar. We present here a pattern to describe this model as it exists in several Big Data systems.", "venue": "European Conference on Pattern Languages of Programs", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book"], "publicationDate": "2018-07-04", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 23rd European Conference on Pattern Languages of Programs"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "152353447", "name": "Julio Moreno"}, {"authorId": "1745901", "name": "E.
