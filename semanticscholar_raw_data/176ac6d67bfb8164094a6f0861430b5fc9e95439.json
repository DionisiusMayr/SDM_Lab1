Advancement in digital technologies, particularly the Internet of Things, have enabled cities to become smarter and thus affected many structures (physical, social, etc.). Given such broad scope and the effects the smart city could bring about, the growing numbers of research seems to be inadequate. This paper attempts to review the past studies and identify what have been done and not done. Smart city research related to Southeast Asia in particular is also looked at in this paper. The literature was categorised and discussed under three main aspects concerning the area of management information systems, namely business, organization and technology. Gaps are identified, and future research are called for.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "3350670", "name": "L.
