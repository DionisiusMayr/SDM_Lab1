Even prior to last year, collaborative mapping was recognized for its capability to facilitate synergistic data access and reduce complicated workflows. GeoNode is a web-based open-source software technology stack used to deploy geospatial content management systems to support Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDI). This paper will discuss the use and customization of GeoNode as an open-source project to support collaborative mapping in local governance through a GIS web interface. The intended audience of this paper includes active developers of GeoNode, potential developers both new and experienced who are interested in using GeoNode for data management and collaboration, and members of local government authority who have the power to organize the resources to implement a collaborative GIS system in their communities. The method for developing a customized GeoNode prototype is described within the context of local government deployment. An evaluation of GeoNode includes a critique of the platform\u2019s ability to support basic collaborative functions. Finally, recommendations are given to the audience based on the development experience with the prototype, the GeoNode community, and future of the GeoNode project.", "venue": "", "year": null, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2294607689", "name": "J.
