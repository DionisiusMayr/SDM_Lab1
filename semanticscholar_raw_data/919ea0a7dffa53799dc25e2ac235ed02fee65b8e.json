The output of the PST-Hotspot detection problem consists of the following: (a) a col-lection of spatial regions (which show high intensity of events) and, (b) their respective time intervals of high activity and periodicity values (e.g., daily, weekday-only, etc). PST-Hotspot detection poses significant challenge for designing a suitable interest measure. The aim over here is to design a mathematical representation of a PST-Hotspot such that it can differentiate interesting periodic patterns from trivial persistent patterns in the dataset. The current state of the art in the area of spatial and spatio-temporal hotspot detection focus on non-periodic patterns. In contrast, our proposed approach is able to determine periodic hotspots. We experimentally evaluated our proposed algorithm using real Azure traffic dataset from the Indian region.", "venue": "2022 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW)", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-11-01", "journal": {"name": "2022 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW)", "pages": "1037-1044"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "144551709", "name": "Venkata M.
