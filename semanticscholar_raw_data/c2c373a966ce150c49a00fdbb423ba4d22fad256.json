A coupled model is proposed to simulate urban floods in real\u2010time and achieve comprehensive water system control for urban floods. First, the systematical description of coordinated drainage and regulation model of urban water systems in China is introduced, then the practice of Fuzhou city was taken as an example to introduce the prediction and forecast systems, as well as water system regulation for urban flood and waterlogging disaster in detail. Results show that the root\u2010mean\u2010square error of river flood prediction is less than 0.3 and that the calculation time of waterlogging simulation is less than 10\u2009min; the optimization regulation reduces the peak river water level by 31\u2009cm. This study will establish a novel urban water system management model to help urban managers better reduce the loss caused by urban floods.", "venue": "River", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2023-02-01", "journal": {"name": "River", "pages": "20 - 5", "volume": "2"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2144220951", "name": "Hao Wang"}, {"authorId": "1962208", "name": "X.
