Up to date, a formal definition, as well as a platform-independent approach for its detection, is still lacking. This paper proposes a general framework to identify echo chambers on online social networks built on top of features they commonly share. Our approach is based on a four-step pipeline that involves (i) the identification of a controversial issue; (ii) the inference of users\u2019 ideology on the controversy; (iii) the construction of users\u2019 debate network; and (iv) the detection of homogeneous meso-scale communities. We further apply our framework in a detailed case study on Reddit, covering the first two and a half years of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. Our main purpose is to assess the existence of Pro-Trump and Anti-Trump echo chambers among three sociopolitical issues, as well as to analyze their stability and consistency over time. Even if users appear strongly polarized with respect to their ideology, most tend not to insulate themselves in echo chambers. However, the found polarized communities were proven to be definitely stable over time.", "venue": "Applied Sciences", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2021-06-10", "journal": {"name": "Applied Sciences"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1869835702", "name": "Virginia Morini"}, {"authorId": "28956425", "name": "Laura Pollacci"}, {"authorId": "37340414", "name": "Giulio Rossetti"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "210c2bcc438c38dada64158a78422116d376c757", "title": "From Perils to Possibilities: Understanding how Human (and AI) Biases affect Online Fora"}, {"paperId": "b4f882aa965726d21dfcddb3a7bb5711f5382710", "title": "Predicting Interpersonal Influence from Conversational Features"}, {"paperId": "a41d034640b32685a3011fc1a9023c6754fa4d47", "title": "YouTube\u2019s recommendation algorithm is left-leaning in the United States"}, {"paperId": "c7b8be4ad6639fa5353d829cdfb0b9fe4854c2a9", "title": "Trends and Topics: Characterizing Echo Chambers' Topological Stability and In-group Attitudes"}, {"paperId": "ab8d6f022c9e1c09445da1dd503dbbdd7bbf95ca", "title": "Quantifying the Echo Chamber Effect: An Embedding Distance-based Approach"}, {"paperId": "706917cb695a6cac21f6150cbef29c0beb00d6b7", "title": "Did COVID-19 Blur Partisan Boundaries?
