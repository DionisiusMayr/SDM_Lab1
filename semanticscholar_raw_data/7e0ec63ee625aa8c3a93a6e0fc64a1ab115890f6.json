With a high satisfaction rating of 88%, participants in the Edge Computing condition saw an astonishing 18% decrease in task completion times. Similarly, in the AI integration scenario, participants rated AI's value at 86%, and they saw a significant 12% reduction in task completion times and a noteworthy 7% drop in mistake rates. Significantly, with an astounding 21% gain in work completion times, the Edge Computing and AI combo had the largest performance boost. These results highlight how Edge Computing and AI may dramatically improve industrial efficiency and performance in the context of Industry 5.0, providing insightful information for businesses looking to use these technologies to streamline processes and spur innovation.", "venue": "BIO Web of Conferences", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "BIO Web of Conferences"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2280525161", "name": "Ekaterina Dmitrieva"}, {"authorId": "2280697296", "name": "Gaurav Thakur"}, {"authorId": "14040043", "name": "Pranav Kumar Prabhakar"}, {"authorId": "2280709685", "name": "Anshika Prakash"}, {"authorId": "2280477414", "name": "Anjali Vyas"}, {"authorId": "2280931338", "name": "Y.Lakshmi Prasanna"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "3f76d9692923ce35a2fea37193bbea8549f9b537", "title": "Real-Time Traffic Management in Smart Cities: Insights from the Traffic Management Simulation and Impact Analysis"}, {"paperId": "dd2e45d3fdc2309456964e17e9bfdddeee208b1b", "title": "Dynamic Communication in Emergency Response: A Data-Driven Evaluation with the Emergency Communication Test"}, {"paperId": "605865ae2c131976be189e2d87fb57ef7b9239b0", "title": "IoT-Enhanced Public Safety in Smart Environments: A Comparative Analysis Using the Public Safety IoT Test"}, {"paperId": "74fe7dd0c5a21108ffec987cda02a82a28b9c92f", "title": "Security and Privacy in AI-Driven Industry 5.0: Experimental Insights and Threat Analysis"}]}
