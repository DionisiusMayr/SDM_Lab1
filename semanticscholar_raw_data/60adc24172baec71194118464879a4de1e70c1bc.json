The key of signal control is to adjust the traffic lights\nappropriately according to the traffic flow, which is an adaptive\ncontrol. In this paper, we propose a new timing strategy. This\nstrategy includes green time optimization and lane combination\ncalculation. According to the real-time traffic flow, we optimize\ngreen time and calculate lane combination to adjust the cycle and\nthen we can get the timing plan. The simulation results of random\ndata and actual traffic data show that the strategy we proposed\ncan increase traffic efficiency by more than 15% at intersections,\nreduce vehicle detention, and relieve traffic congestion.", "venue": "", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications", "volume": "9"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "145322511", "name": "Ping Guo"}, {"authorId": "48894359", "name": "Daiwen Lei"}, {"authorId": "145779530", "name": "Lian Ye"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "7bbbb208e11c89a27d6e91278bcaad55d4471b5f", "title": "How to Improve Urban Intelligent Traffic?
