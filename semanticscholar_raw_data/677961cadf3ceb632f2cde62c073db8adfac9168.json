This paper closely examines the development process of chaos-based image-encryption algorithms from various angles, including symmetric and asymmetric algorithms, block ciphers and stream ciphers, and integration with other technologies. The unique attributes of chaos, such as sensitivity to initial conditions, topological transitivity, and pseudo-randomness, are conducive to cross-referencing with other disciplines and improving image-encryption methods. Additionally, this paper covers practical application scenarios and current challenges of chaotic image encryption, thereby encouraging researchers to continue developing and complementing existing situations, and may also serve as a basis of future development prospects for chaos-based image encryption.", "venue": "Mathematics", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-06-05", "journal": {"name": "Mathematics"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2220651081", "name": "Bowen Zhang"}, {"authorId": "25966126", "name": "Lingfeng Liu"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "49c115db8e6ad734db23fbb7eadf7a9c1731d130", "title": "Statistical Analysis of the Negative\u2013Positive Transformation in Image Encryption"}, {"paperId": "52832db04ed9f6fe0b8960fe97b6faddf6d25f91", "title": "Towards accurate keyspace analysis of chaos-based image ciphers"}, {"paperId": "0779ad4167f999f60578b8a2cfc37e75c4624d13", "title": "Discrete one-dimensional piecewise chaotic systems without fixed points"}, {"paperId": "244d2808eff1afa51564ce973ebbf750848d3bbc", "title": "Novel image pixel scrambling technique for efficient color image encryption in resource-constrained IoT devices"}, {"paperId": "5b3e86ce127c28d45797dc60ce9d4c64e7073b31", "title": "A New Class of Sine-Cosine Chaotic Systems and Its Application to Image Encryption"}, {"paperId": "0102ca91ee0e4cf9552fe2bf26dfbece327f255d", "title": "Design and FPGA Implementation of the Henon Chaotic Map for Image Encryption"}, {"paperId": "efe4da44d0a9a66b477e5d26f1a403ab99601302", "title": "Sequence Prediction and Classification of Echo State Networks"}, {"paperId": "996cdfe52453d8a5fb52698e99dd7667ae185873", "title": "A Two Step Chaos-Based 3D Model Encryption"}, {"paperId": "f58b297e904276987480850d8e745e6f52dd5497", "title": "Synchronization of Boolean networks with chaos-driving and its application in image cryptosystem"}, {"paperId": "0db0e8074ec6f410133580331b26613718673b24", "title": "Medical Image Encryption: A Comprehensive Review"}, {"paperId": "c587a7eab966239b618cafebed623e18cc93756e", "title": "Fault Location Optimisation For Transmission Line Using Chaotic Artificial Hummingbird Algorithm"}, {"paperId": "194cefc0e259acdd1b5ff8d5a663dcfccc40dc88", "title": "Construction of a New 2D Hyperchaotic Map with Application in Efficient Pseudo-Random Number Generator Design and Color Image Encryption"}, {"paperId": "827fc528d82e7c0339d2537ecd2a69e6ac48c2e2", "title": "Scrambled Encryption Approach for Color Images Based on 9-D Chaotic Systems with 3-D Substitution Bit Levels"}, {"paperId": "69f649ec100e51e69322409f6017a113d34848e2", "title": "A novel delayed exponent coupled chaotic map with countering dynamical degradation"}, {"paperId": "091dd7ad1d308242afb2b946a3d0dc6fd49f2988", "title": "A Deep Dive into Chaos-Based Image Encryption - Reviewing, Implementing, and Addressing Challenges"}, {"paperId": "6dadedfbe94c975e0fe845cd96756358d16fbb60", "title": "Hidden chaotic mechanisms for a family of chameleon systems"}]}
