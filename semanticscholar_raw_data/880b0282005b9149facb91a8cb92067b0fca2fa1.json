Many graph-based anomaly detection techniques are proposed to identify the suspicious accounts and behaviors. However, most of them detect the anomalies once the users have performed many such behaviors. Their performance is substantially hindered when the users' observed data is limited at an early stage, which needs to be improved to minimize financial loss. In this work, we propose Eland, a novel framework that uses action sequence augmentation for early anomaly detection. Eland utilizes a sequence predictor to predict next actions of every user and exploits the mutual enhancement between action sequence augmentation and user-action graph anomaly detection. Experiments on three real-world datasets show that Eland improves the performance of a variety of graph-based anomaly detection methods. With Eland, anomaly detection performance at an earlier stage is better than non-augmented methods that need significantly more observed data by up to 15% on the Area under the ROC curve.", "venue": "International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2020-10-20", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 30th ACM International Conference on Information & Knowledge Management"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1742573", "name": "Tong Zhao"}, {"authorId": "2064408160", "name": "Bo Ni"}, {"authorId": "2116672799", "name": "Wenhao Yu"}, {"authorId": "2109411071", "name": "Zhichun Guo"}, {"authorId": "145474474", "name": "Neil Shah"}, {"authorId": "2152153528", "name": "Meng Jiang"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "5c0b6daded9a59ef7ea4b28fb06d30ecbf29daf5", "title": "Deep anomaly detection on set data: Survey and comparison"}, {"paperId": "74b0976a3a7b7013fd468a043a940dcf401e66f1", "title": "User Modeling in the Era of Large Language Models: Current Research and Future Directions"}, {"paperId": "57cb09afec65031ab95a3db17f02c38118a2ac36", "title": "GADY: Unsupervised Anomaly Detection on Dynamic Graphs"}, {"paperId": "9164cbb9156e6a38429fdfff33371f259f493b8c", "title": "Data-centric Graph Learning: A Survey"}, {"paperId": "9fde7a5d491e25d2ff040e2f2f2517fa5b753e85", "title": "A Survey of Imbalanced Learning on Graphs: Problems, Techniques, and Future Directions"}, {"paperId": "a3c03af55305c972aaf7df49bca002b56daa453c", "title": "Temporal Dynamics-Aware Adversarial Attacks on Discrete-Time Dynamic Graph Models"}, {"paperId": "453579586fc7ae70133f8879c43ef425f97d7172", "title": "Graph-based Time-Series Anomaly Detection: A Survey"}, {"paperId": "6178a6b71ce5846104970819321d58a4e1e6759d", "title": "MLPInit: Embarrassingly Simple GNN Training Acceleration with MLP Initialization"}, {"paperId": "7d6d02f4eae543b5259059569f81861fb23afd42", "title": "Improving Generalizability of Graph Anomaly Detection Models via Data Augmentation"}, {"paperId": "7e341f23987570a150b2b0c0ef9b77d5c2a8ce5d", "title": "AHEAD: A Triple Attention Based Heterogeneous Graph Anomaly Detection Approach"}, {"paperId": "4d6b580c9bc8719943bfb2e45cb01829865f8d9c", "title": "Anomaly Detection for Spatiotemporal Data in Action"}, {"paperId": "22f1d9efab67a43d83df0178f6f67b2ffe93039e", "title": "Graph Rationalization with Environment-based Augmentations"}, {"paperId": "ff424f1125f68c03a0e27d3ff1033fa565abe1eb", "title": "Graph Data Augmentation for Graph Machine Learning: A Survey"}, {"paperId": "1abea3a08c56da8bf4930796317a3d0fdd0518fb", "title": "Learning from Counterfactual Links for Link Prediction"}, {"paperId": "c35fcc5d4793c719a2508b03d2027b2f88291095", "title": "Imperceptible Adversarial Attacks on Discrete-Time Dynamic Graph Models"}, {"paperId": "f43e2a64358e2f0f420183f317c636f7df3fdffd", "title": "AutoGDA: Automated Graph Data Augmentation for Node Classification"}]}
