AEC brings flexible deployment with Line-of-Sight communication links for task offloading and computing services. In this article, we present a comprehensive survey of the AEC technology. First, we introduce a three-layer architecture of AEC, which includes the satellite, unmanned aircraft vehicles, and ground terminals. Second, we illustrate challenges in AEC, and summarize recent studies in terms of AEC performance metrics that include energy efficiency, latency, and operation cost to address challenges in AEC. Further, we introduce the advanced technologies applied in AEC management, e.g., artificial intelligence (AI) and the distributed optimization. Finally, the applications and the open issues with AEC are summarized and classified in the study.", "venue": "IEEE Internet of Things Journal", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-08-15", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Internet of Things Journal", "pages": "14357-14374", "volume": "10"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2112724801", "name": "Qing Zhang"}, {"authorId": "1645228158", "name": "Ying Luo"}, {"authorId": "2158159517", "name": "Hong Jiang"}, {"authorId": "152645158", "name": "Kecheng Zhang"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "e710c0cb5001ca2209b5fed9abb03831b478786b", "title": "MO-AVC: Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Based Trajectory Control and Task Offloading in Multi-UAV-Enabled MEC Systems"}, {"paperId": "05f73df2b8b23afb16b472f8f72c52d80c02d1fe", "title": "Trajectory-Aware Offloading Decision in UAV-Aided Edge Computing: A Comprehensive Survey"}, {"paperId": "f69345b6382eb3a8a5486e1d22c8585d4247fedd", "title": "Computation offloading in NOMA-MEC-enabled aerial-vehicular networks exploiting mmWave capabilities"}, {"paperId": "b38ede2a5ab815417e8271028634a0f16951f960", "title": "A Survey on Integrating Edge Computing With AI and Blockchain in Maritime Domain, Aerial Systems, IoT, and Industry 4.0"}]}
