Centralized systems schedule at task granularity, but only schedule a few thousand tasks per second. Distributed systems schedule hundreds of thousands of tasks per second but changing the schedule is costly. \nWe present execution templates, a control plane abstraction that can schedule hundreds of thousands of tasks per second while supporting fine-grained, per-task scheduling decisions. Execution templates leverage a program's repetitive control flow to cache blocks of frequently-executed tasks. Executing a task in a template requires sending a single message. Large-scale scheduling changes install new templates, while small changes apply edits to existing templates. \nEvaluations of execution templates in Nimbus, a data analytics framework, find that they provide the fine-grained scheduling flexibility of centralized control planes while matching the strong scaling of distributed ones. Execution templates support complex, real-world applications, such as a fluid simulation with a triply nested loop and data dependent branches.", "venue": "USENIX Annual Technical Conference", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2017-05-04", "journal": {"pages": "513-526"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2274456", "name": "Omid Mashayekhi"}, {"authorId": "47938939", "name": "Hang Qu"}, {"authorId": "23174062", "name": "Chinmayee Shah"}, {"authorId": "1721681", "name": "P.
