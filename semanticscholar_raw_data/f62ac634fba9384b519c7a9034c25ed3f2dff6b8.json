As information technology advances, the number of Internet users grows, the penetration rate improves, and the number of self-media users of network new media grows. Using historical data to predict future behavior and learn from massive amounts of data, humanity has entered the new media age, thanks to the rapid advancement of mobile Internet technology. It solves the problem that traditional database management systems cannot find hidden relationships and rules in data and cannot predict the future based on the data they have. This paper investigates the use of DM technology to intelligently govern network public opinion. Finance, telecommunications, network-related industries, retailers, manufacturing, medical care, pharmaceutical industry, and scientific fields have all made extensive use of it. Data mining (abbreviated as DM) is a type of data analysis that extracts credible, novel, effective, and understandable patterns from large amounts of data. It is closely related to database knowledge discovery.", "venue": "Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-03-25", "journal": {"name": "Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2115891004", "name": "Jingyi Wang"}], "citations": []}
