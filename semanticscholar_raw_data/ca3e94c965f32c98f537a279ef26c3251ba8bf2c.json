Only a methodical strategy will be able to address these issues. The creation of smart cities is one of the new ideas to handle the current challenges of cities. An important aspect of the Internet of Things (IoT) is the implementation of smart city initiatives. The IoT is a relatively new idea in wireless communication, yet it is expanding rapidly. Incorporating wireless sensors and Internet connectivity endows everyday things with digital intelligence. Real-time data can be used to communicate between items without the need for human interaction. The IoT framework aims to connect and intelligently improve systems and networks in order to make smart city projects work better. The literature review demonstrates that IoT has been extensively employed in a variety of smart cities projects in recent years because of its great efficiency. As a result, the primary aim of this research is to examine the applications of IoT in smart cities, a key research area in the engineering and academic sectors. For this purpose, smart city articles from 2012 to 2022 are analyzed. In addition, the Web of Science (WOS) platform is used to conduct two types of research: qualitative studies and quantitative studies. The analytical results of this study show that the IoT can be used as a powerful tool to solve and manage many complicated problems in smart city projects.", "venue": "2022 IEEE Intl Conf on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing, Intl Conf on Pervasive Intelligence and Computing, Intl Conf on Cloud and Big Data Computing, Intl Conf on Cyber Science and Technology Congress (DASC/PiCom/CBDCom/CyberSciTech)", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-09-12", "journal": {"name": "2022 IEEE Intl Conf on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing, Intl Conf on Pervasive Intelligence and Computing, Intl Conf on Cloud and Big Data Computing, Intl Conf on Cyber Science and Technology Congress (DASC/PiCom/CBDCom/CyberSciTech)", "pages": "1-6"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2598327", "name": "Sina Shaffiee Haghshenas"}, {"authorId": "3309290", "name": "G.
