However, due to the execution of Spark SQL, there are multiple times to write intermediate data to the disk, which reduces the execution efficiency of Spark SQL. Targeting on the existing issues, we design and implement an intermediate data cache layer between the underlying file system and the upper Spark core to reduce the cost of random disk I/O. By using the query pre-analysis module, we can dynamically adjust the capacity of cache layer for different queries. And the allocation module can allocate proper memory for each node in cluster. This paper develops the SSO (Spark SQL optimizer) module and integrates it into the original Spark system to achieve the above functions. This paper compares the query performance with the existing Spark SQL by experiment data generated by TPC-H tool. The experimental results show that the SSO module can effectively improve the query efficiency, reduce the disk I/O cost and make full use of the cluster memory resources.", "venue": "IEEE International Performance, Computing, and Communications Conference", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2019-10-01", "journal": {"name": "2019 IEEE 38th International Performance Computing and Communications Conference (IPCCC)", "pages": "1-6"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2256418", "name": "Mingyu Zhai"}, {"authorId": "7219012", "name": "Aibo Song"}, {"authorId": "2116039007", "name": "Jingyi Qiu"}, {"authorId": "2117710900", "name": "Xuechun Ji"}, {"authorId": "32145440", "name": "Qingxi Wu"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "1205db22973f35ddbee1f01b7658f3c54f64f7b1", "title": "ACORE: A Query Optimization Approach for Spark SQL Based on Cost Model and Markov Prediction Model"}, {"paperId": "cf866f8ccbd88d9e61dadcaf0d09f34135b9dbbe", "title": "Optimising SQL Queries Using Genetic Improvement"}]}
