And then, combined with the factors of orbital inclination, detection width, and revisit interval, the target detection probability model of the networked satellite system is established. The model defines the relationship between the technical performance index and the operational performance index of the networked satellite system and provides an effective way for the requirement analysis, top-level design, and efficiency evaluation of the networked satellite system. Finally, the correctness and applicability of the model are verified by the simulation results with the ground vehicle as the detection target.", "venue": "Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2023-12-04", "journal": {"name": "2023 4th China International SAR Symposium (CISS)", "pages": "1-8"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2278772390", "name": "Jikai Liu"}, {"authorId": "2278825006", "name": "Xin Lin"}, {"authorId": "51236265", "name": "Dexin Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2278773214", "name": "Wan Liu"}, {"authorId": "152497887", "name": "Xiaowei Shao"}], "citations": []}
