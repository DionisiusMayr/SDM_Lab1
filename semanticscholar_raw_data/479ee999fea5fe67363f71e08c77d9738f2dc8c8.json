While the current state-of-the-art techniques use static program analysis to reduce I/O, Cybertron proposes a new direction that incorporates runtime mechanisms to push the limit further on I/O reduction. In particular, Cybertron tracks how data is used in the computation accurately at runtime to filter unused data at finer granularity dynamically, beyond what current static-analysis based mechanisms are capable of, and to facilitate a new mechanism called constraint based encoding for more efficient encoding. Cybertron has been implemented and applied to production data-parallel programs; our extensive evaluations on real programs and real data have shown its effectiveness on I/O reduction over the existing mechanisms at reasonable CPU cost, and its improvement on end-to-end performance in various network environments.", "venue": "Conference on Object-Oriented Programming Systems, Languages, and Applications", "year": 2014, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2014-10-15", "journal": {"name": "ACM SIGPLAN Notices", "pages": "895 - 908", "volume": "49"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2061135672", "name": "Tian Xiao"}, {"authorId": "1850900", "name": "Zhenyu Guo"}, {"authorId": "2695249", "name": "Hucheng Zhou"}, {"authorId": "2478181", "name": "Jiaxing Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2118490244", "name": "Xu Zhao"}, {"authorId": "1715145", "name": "Chencheng Ye"}, {"authorId": "2108249416", "name": "Xi Wang"}, {"authorId": "2108811155", "name": "Wei Lin"}, {"authorId": "1712168", "name": "Wenguang Chen"}, {"authorId": "93317102", "name": "Lidong Zhou"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "0507471b229ca23a25aa042fcb24ec9a0e35ed25", "title": "Tigris: a DSL and Framework for Monitoring Software Systems at Runtime"}, {"paperId": "0b53cea748bdb5a404ed6999c23eb097622f0f08", "title": "Too Big to Eat: Boosting Analytics Data Ingestion from Object Stores with Scoop"}, {"paperId": "f90756e4d726514585a2633e9b38cc05708185c1", "title": "Empirical Big Data Research: A Systematic Literature Mapping"}]}
