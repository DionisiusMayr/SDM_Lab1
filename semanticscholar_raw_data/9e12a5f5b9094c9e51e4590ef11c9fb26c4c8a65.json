A data lake collects massive raw and heterogeneous data with different data schemas and query interfaces. Many real-life applications require query answering over the heterogeneous data lake, such as e-commerce, bioinformatics and healthcare. In this paper, we propose LakeAns that semantically integrates heterogeneous data schemas of the lake to enhance the semantics of query answers. To this end, we propose a novel framework to efficiently and effectively perform the cross-source searching. The framework exploits a reinforcement learning method to semantically integrate the data schemas and further create a global relational schema for the heterogeneous data. It then performs a query answering algorithm based on the global schema to find answers across multiple data sources. We conduct extensive experimental evaluations using real-life data to verify that our approach outperforms existing solutions in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.", "venue": "Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-07-18", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 46th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2175278171", "name": "Qin Yuan"}, {"authorId": "2223883623", "name": "Ye Yuan"}, {"authorId": "1788122", "name": "Z.
