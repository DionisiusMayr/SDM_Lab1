First, the descriptors of the related articles published from 2002 to 2016 were extracted from WoS, by conducting a keyword search using the \u201cInternet of Things\u201d keyword. Data analysis and clustering were carried out in SPSS, UCINET, and PreMap. The analysis results revealed that the scientific literature published on IoT during the period had grown exponentially, with an approximately 48% growth rate in the last two years of the study period (i.e. 2015 and 2016). After analyzing the themes of the documents, the resulting concepts were classified into twelve clusters. The twelve main clusters included: Privacy and Security, Authentication and Identification, Computing, Standards and Protocols, IoT as a component, Big Data, Architecture, Applied New Techniques in IoT, Application, Connection and Communication Tools, Wireless Network Protocols, and Wireless Sensor Networks.", "venue": "Int.
