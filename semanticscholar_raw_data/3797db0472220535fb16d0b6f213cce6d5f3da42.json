Traditional data cleaning focuses on quality issues of a dataset in isolation of the application using the data\u2014Cleaning Before ML\u2014which can be inef\ufb01cient and, counterintuitively, degrade the application further. While recent cleaning approaches take into account signals from the ML model, such as the model accuracy, they are still local to a speci\ufb01c model, and do not take into account the entire application\u2019s semantics and user goals. What is needed is an end-to-end application-driven approach towards Cleaning For ML, that can leverage signals throughout the entire ML application to optimize the cleaning for application goals and to reduce manual cleaning efforts. This paper brie\ufb02y reviews recent progress in Cleaning For ML, presents our vision of a holistic cleaning framework, and outlines new challenges that arise when data cleaning meets ML applications.", "venue": "IEEE Data Engineering Bulletin", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "IEEE Data Eng.
