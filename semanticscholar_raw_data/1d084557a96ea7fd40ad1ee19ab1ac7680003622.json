ErWCA, like other algorithms, may still fall in the sub-optimal region and have a slow convergence, especially in high-dimensional tasks problems. This paper suggests an enhanced ErWCA (EErWCA) version, which embeds local escaping operator (LEO) as an internal operator in the updating process. ErWCA also uses a control-randomization operator. To verify this version, a comparison between EErWCA and other algorithms, namely, classical ErWCA, water cycle algorithm (WCA), butterfly optimization algorithm (BOA), bird swarm algorithm (BSA), crow search algorithm (CSA), grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA), Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO), whale optimization algorithm (WOA), dandelion optimizer (DO) and fire hawks optimization (FHO) using IEEE CEC 2017, was performed. The experimental and analytical results show the adequate performance of the proposed algorithm.", "venue": "Processes", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-11-02", "journal": {"name": "Processes"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "32168818", "name": "A.
