The main features of edge computing are to drag the cloud services toward the network edge with dramatic reductions of latency while increasing the resource utilization of the network and computing devices. Being the natural extension of cloud computing, edge computing inherits a variety of research challenges and brings forth different new issues to solve. These challenges are dealing with solving complex optimization problems including scheduling and processing real\u2010time applications. Nature\u2010inspired meta\u2010heuristic (NIMH) algorithm is an overarching term in the field of an optimization problem that provides robust solutions to the NP\u2010complete problems, from computationally tractable approximate solutions to real\u2010time optimization strategies. Nowadays, different NIMH algorithms have been applied in the field of edge computing for solving various research challenges including resource placement and scheduling, communication, mobility, and edge controlling with higher efficiency. In this survey, we classify the existing NIMH into three categories based on their nature of works and included fuzzy logic and systems in the field of edge networks along with different research challenges. Further, we introduce different challenges and future directions to identify promising research works in edge computing.", "venue": "Software, Practice & Experience", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2021-09-20", "journal": {"name": "Software: Practice and Experience", "pages": "1004 - 1034", "volume": "52"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2644477", "name": "Mainak Adhikari"}, {"authorId": "1698593", "name": "S.
