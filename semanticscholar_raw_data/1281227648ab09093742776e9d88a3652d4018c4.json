The convergence of IoT, CC, and BGD provides new opportunities in various real-time applications, including telecommunication, healthcare, business, education, science, and engineering. Together, these approaches are facing various challenges during data gathering, processing, and management. The focus of this research paper is to pinpoint the emerging trends in IoT, CC, and BGD. The convergence of these approaches and their impact on various real-time applications, benefits, and challenges associated with all these approaches, current industry trends, and future research directions with especial focus on the healthcare domain. The paper also provides a conceptual framework that integrates IoT, CC, and BGD and provides an IoT centric cloud infrastructure using BGD. Finally, this paper summarizes by providing directions for researchers and practitioners about how to leverage the benefits of combining these approaches.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications", "volume": "11"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "40219178", "name": "M.
