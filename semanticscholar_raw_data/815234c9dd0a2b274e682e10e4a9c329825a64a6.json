It offers efficient and responsive processing by optimizing the database storage, and adopting the domain-specific optimizations. Our preliminary deployments and experiments validate its feasibility in performing crowdsourced analytics.", "venue": "WiNTECH@MobiCom", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book"], "publicationDate": "2017-07-24", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 11th Workshop on Wireless Network Testbeds, Experimental evaluation & CHaracterization"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "16038169", "name": "Wenguang Huang"}, {"authorId": "2110843882", "name": "Changgen Zhou"}, {"authorId": "2864629", "name": "Yuanjie Li"}, {"authorId": "1860265446", "name": "Xinbing Wang"}, {"authorId": "2014352", "name": "Songwu Lu"}, {"authorId": "1922573", "name": "Luoyi Fu"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "8861762cf05f2e1d54352ad1cc851ed9d35a9399", "title": "Detecting Anomaly in Large-scale Network using Mobile Crowdsourcing"}, {"paperId": "582196401b38696b18e12bf124c646fa2efacd15", "title": "Crowdsourcing based large-scale network anomaly detection"}, {"paperId": "793815fd2fc91a24768f64bb7a71752e67674a9b", "title": "A Machine Learning Based Approach to Mobile Network Analysis"}]}
