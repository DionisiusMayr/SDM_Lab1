In order to test the effectiveness of the two schemes, seven machine learning methods and three types of prediction tasks are used. The shareholder relation network information\u2019s effectiveness and machine learning methods are also analyzed. Results show that the graph statistics of shareholder relationship networks are insufficient to be used independently as input features for predicting bond default risk but can provide helpful incremental information based on financial features. The shareholder relation information is effective for predicting bond default risk. The structure statistics perform best among all graph statistics overall, and Cascade Forest and LightGBM perform best among all seven machine learning methods.", "venue": "J of Control Science and Engineering", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-11-30", "journal": {"name": "J.
