It is likely to occur more frequently due to increasing urbanization, deforestation, and climate change. Landslide susceptibility mapping is vital to safeguard life and property. This article surveys machine learning (ML) models used for landslide susceptibility mapping to understand the current trend by analyzing published articles based on the ML models, landslide causative factors (LCFs), study location, datasets, evaluation methods, and model performance. Existing literature considered in this comprehensive survey is systematically selected using the ROSES protocol. The trend indicates a growing interest in the field. The choice of LCFs depends on data availability and case study location; China is the most studied location, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) is considered the best evaluation metric. Many ML models have achieved an AUC value > 0.90, indicating high reliability of the susceptibility map generated. This paper also discusses the recently developed hybrid, ensemble, and deep learning (DL) models in landslide susceptibility mapping. Generally, hybrid, ensemble, and DL models outperform conventional ML models. Based on the survey, a few recommendations and future works which may help the new researchers in the field are also presented.", "venue": "Remote Sensing", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-06-24", "journal": {"name": "Remote.
