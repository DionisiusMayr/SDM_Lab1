However, remote-sensing (RS) algorithms based on the programming model are trapped in dense disk I/O operations and unconstrained network communication, and thus inappropriate for timely processing and analyzing massive, heterogeneous RS data. In this paper, a novel in-memory computing framework called Apache Spark (Spark) is introduced. Through its merits of transferring transformation to in-memory datasets of Spark, the shortages are eliminated. To facilitate implementation and assure high performance of Spark-based algorithms in a complex cloud computing environment, a strip-oriented parallel programming model is proposed. By incorporating strips of RS data with resilient distributed datasets (RDDs) of Spark, all-level parallel RS algorithms can be easily expressed with coarse-grained transformation primitives and BitTorrent-enabled broadcast variables. Additionally, a generic image partition method for Spark-based RS algorithms to efficiently generate differentiable key/value strips from a Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS) is implemented for concealing the heterogeneousness of RS data. Data-intensive multitasking algorithms and iteration-intensive algorithms were evaluated on a Hadoop yet another resource negotiator (YARN) platform. Experiments indicated that our Spark-based parallel algorithms are of great efficiency, a multitasking algorithm took less than 4 h to process more than half a terabyte of RS data on a small YARN cluster, and 9*9 convolution operations against a 909-MB image took less than 260 s. Further, the efficiency of iteration-intensive algorithms is insensitive to image size.", "venue": "IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing", "pages": "3-19", "volume": "10"}, "authors": [{"authorId": null, "name": "Wei Huang"}, {"authorId": "144744632", "name": "L.
