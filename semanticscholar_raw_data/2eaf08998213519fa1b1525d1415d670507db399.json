We consider microcontroller-programming with a declarative language based on the logic-programming language Datalog. Many microcontrollers have very limited memory, e.g. the Atmel ATMega328P that is used in the standard Arduino board today has 2 KBytes RAM. Our prototype implementation translates a Datalog dialect to C-code for the Arduino IDE. However, in order to prove the correctness of the implementation, it is necessary to ensure that the memory is su\ufb03cient for the derived facts. In this paper, we propose a class of constraints called \u201cgeneralized exclusion constraints\u201d, and show how they can be used for this task. Moreover, they are needed to exclude con\ufb02icting commands to the hardware, e.g. that di\ufb00erent values are output on the same pin in the same state. This class of constraints also generalizes keys and functional dependencies, therefore our results also help to prove that such constraints hold for derived predicates.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "1800905", "name": "Stefan Brass"}, {"authorId": "2065600386", "name": "Mario Wenzel"}], "citations": []}
