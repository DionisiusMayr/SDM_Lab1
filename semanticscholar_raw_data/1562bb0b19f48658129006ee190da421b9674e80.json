Activating a distress signal triggers a swift and coordinated response, with the system promptly dispatching a \u201cNeed Help\u201d message via GSM to pre-registered contacts, accompanied by real-time GPS-derived location coordinates. The seamless synergy of Arduino technology ensures effective communication and interaction among system components, bolstering user security and expediting response times. By combining Arduino's versatility with GSM's reliable communication and GPS's precision, this innovative system presents a holistic solution to empower women in distress and significantly advance the landscape of women's safety technology. Its potential to save lives and contribute to a safer environment makes it a pivotal development in addressing the safety concerns of women.", "venue": "2023 Intelligent Computing and Control for Engineering and Business Systems (ICCEBS)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2023-12-14", "journal": {"name": "2023 Intelligent Computing and Control for Engineering and Business Systems (ICCEBS)", "pages": "1-5"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "16887312", "name": "C.
