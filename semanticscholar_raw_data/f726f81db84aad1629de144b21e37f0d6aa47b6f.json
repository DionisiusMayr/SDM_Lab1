On the Hadoop platform, a big data deep mining and analysis platform based on map / reduce mode is built, integrating regression analysis, association analysis, data classification, data clustering, text mining, web mining and other data mining algorithms. It can complete 100TB level data retrieval in 30s, and then analyze; the system monitoring server can run stably in a cluster of 256 nodes. The use of APM system can prevent performance bottlenecks, greatly reduce the response time of performance problem processing, and quickly locate the location of performance problems, so as to ensure higher availability and stability of information system.", "venue": "IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2020-11-01", "journal": {"name": "2020 IEEE 40th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS)", "pages": "1358-1363"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2051631542", "name": "Deji Zhao"}, {"authorId": "2144249976", "name": "Bo Ning"}, {"authorId": "2146344793", "name": "Chao Yang"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "9041ab957c818c4acae58586e538095452ae4800", "title": "Design and Application of Intelligent Management Platform Based on Big Data"}]}
