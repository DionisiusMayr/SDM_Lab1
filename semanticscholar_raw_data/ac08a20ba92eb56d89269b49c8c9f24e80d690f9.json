Such algorithmic skeletons are high-order functions implemented in parallel. An application developed with PySke is a composition of skeletons. To ease the write of parallel programs, PySke does not follow the Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD) paradigm but offers a global view of parallel programs to users. This approach aims at writing scalable programs easily. In addition to the library, we present experiments performed on a highperformance computing cluster (distributed memory) on a set of example applications developed with PySke.", "venue": "International Symposium on High Performance Computing Systems and Applications", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2019-07-01", "journal": {"name": "2019 International Conference on High Performance Computing & Simulation (HPCS)", "pages": "40-47"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "31933880", "name": "Jolan Philippe"}, {"authorId": "1678498", "name": "F.
