In this paper, a cooperative ICN caching scheme based on game theory is proposed, where the ICN topology has been partitioned into some domains. For each piece of content in the individual domain, the caching value degree for the local domain as well as the neighboring domains is computed and it is regarded as the key factor of caching decision. In particular, the caching decision aims at minimizing the average delay of obtaining contents. The experimental results show that the novel cooperative caching scheme has higher cache hit rate and lower delay compared with two benchmarks.", "venue": "Internet Technology Letters", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-04-20", "journal": {"name": "Internet Technology Letters", "volume": "4"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "119651768", "name": "Youli Ren"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "b4260a7a377ec52b0fb1b0b189e8ebb8d9071a38", "title": "Stateless Q-learning algorithm for service caching in resource constrained edge environment"}]}
