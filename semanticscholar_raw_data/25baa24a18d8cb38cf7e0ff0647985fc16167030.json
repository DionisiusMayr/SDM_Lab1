One of the major reasons is the big gaps between the real usage and the provisioned resources. In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth analysis of a Google cluster trace to unveil the root causes for low utilization and highlight the great potential to improve it. We then developed an online resource manager Flex to maximize the cluster utilization while satisfying the Quality of Service (QoS). Large-scale evaluations show that Flex admits up to 1.74\u00d7 more requests and 1.6\u00d7 higher utilization compared to tradition schedulers while maintaining the QoS.
