Many researchers have proposed multivariate analysis for human accommodation. However, no multivariate anthropometric analysis exists for the Mexican population. This study compares common multivariate human accommodation approaches (e.g. principal component and archetypal analyses) and clustering techniques (e.g. k-means and Ward\u2019s algorithm) with the classical percentile-based univariate accommodation approach, using the Chi-squared goodness-of-fit test and the McNemar\u2019s test. The theoretical accommodation percentage obtained by multivariate approaches was higher than those obtained by the percentile univariate approach considering the central 98% data. k-means and archetypal analysis obtained similar and the highest accommodation values, followed by Ward\u2019s algorithm and principal component analysis. The study findings can be deployed to assess the design of workstations in Mexico, such as electronic components assembly and crew designs, and the effects of different anthropometric measurements in human accommodation. Practitioner summary: Products and workplaces design are commonly based on the classical univariate approach, using the extreme percentiles. In this study, multivariate approaches were tested on dimensions for sitting workstations, and results showed a bigger accommodation level in comparison to the univariate 1%\u201399% approaches.
