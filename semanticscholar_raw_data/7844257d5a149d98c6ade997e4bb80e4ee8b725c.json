We present a workflow to improve the management of Magnetic Resonance Imaging data and to increase its compliance with the FAIR principles. This involves using the JSON Metadata Mapping Tool we have developed to map meta-data from a domain-specific file format to a JSON schema based format, and storing the data and the mapped metadata in repositories. Some steps in the workflow are automated, while others require human intervention, facilitated by Graphical User Interfaces for each service. We assessed the compliance of our curated data to the FAIR principles, both manually and using the F-UJI tool. We obtain a FAIR assessment score of 79% for both datasets, which is the highest compared to similar ones in the same field. According to these results, we conclude that the workflow we have implemented can provide a significant improvement towards FAIR data management.", "venue": "Workshop on Data and Research Objects Management for Linked Open Science", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "35018420", "name": "R.
