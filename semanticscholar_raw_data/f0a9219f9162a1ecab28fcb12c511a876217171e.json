Using the thinking forms such as integrity, diversity, and openness, it analyzes the ecological role relationship of the various elements of entrepreneurship education itself, and the relationship between the entrepreneurship education system and the external social ecology.\u008de relationship between the system and the in\u0085uence of various elements on the e\u0086ect of entrepreneurship education is clari\u0087ed to ensure that entrepreneurship education achieves practical results. From the perspective of ecology, based on the research on entrepreneurship education in colleges and universities, on the basis of ecological cognition of entrepreneurship education, this research attempts to solve many problems in the current implementation of entrepreneurship education in colleges and universities through the theoretical construction of an ideal college entrepreneurship education ecosystem.\u008de problem of ecological imbalance can better serve the practice of entrepreneurship education in colleges and universities. At the same time, theoretically expand the horizons of entrepreneurship education research in colleges and universities, and further promote the \u201cconditional\u201d integration of ecological thinking and entrepreneurship education. \u008dis paper introduces the random matrix theory and introduces the related theory of Monte Carlo method.\u008deweight assignment of the evaluation index system is realized, which lays the foundation for the quantitative evaluation.\u008de weight coe\u008ecients of the indicators at all levels are determined by the analytic hierarchy process, and the importance of the indicators is judged by the weight coe\u008ecients, so as to realize the scienti\u0087c quantitative evaluation of the innovation and entrepreneurship education ecosystem. At the same time, the scienti\u0087city of the evaluation index system is veri\u0087ed bymeans of the method of reliability and validity test. \u008de conclusions of this study theoretically solve the main problems existing in the evaluation of the current innovation and entrepreneurship education ecosystem. By building a complete evaluation index system for the innovation and entrepreneurship education ecosystem in colleges and universities, it helps researchers and users to clarify the connotation and elements of the innovation and entrepreneurship education ecosystem in colleges and universities, and fully taps the \u201chidden\u201d elements of evaluation indicators, making the evaluation more comprehensive.", "venue": "", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2115413249", "name": "Fen Yang"}], "citations": []}
