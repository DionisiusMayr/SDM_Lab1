This language is known to be undecidable, so we propose two fragments. In $\\mathit{limit}~\\mathit{Datalog}_{\\mathbb{Z}}$ predicates are axiomatised to keep minimal/maximal numeric values, allowing us to show that fact entailment is coNExpTime-complete in combined, and coNP-complete in data complexity. Moreover, an additional $\\mathit{stability}$ requirement causes the complexity to drop to ExpTime and PTime, respectively. Finally, we show that stable $\\mathit{Datalog}_{\\mathbb{Z}}$ can express many useful data analysis tasks, and so our results provide a sound foundation for the development of advanced information systems.", "venue": "International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2017-05-19", "journal": {"pages": "1123-1130"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "144978000", "name": "M.
