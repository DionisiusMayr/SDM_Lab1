We de\ufb01ne \u201ctopic noise\" as the collection of documents that are irrelevant to any coherent topic and should be \ufb01ltered out. By design, most clustering algorithms (e.g., k-means , hierarchical clustering) assign all input documents to one of the available clusters, guaranteeing any topic noise to propagate into the result. To address these challenges, we present a novel algorithm, FANATIC , that ef\ufb01ciently distinguishes genuine topic documents from those that are topic noise. We also introduce a new Reddit dataset to showcase FANATIC as it contains short, noisy data that is dif\ufb01cult to cluster using most clustering algorithms. We \ufb01nd that FANATIC clusters 500k Reddit titles (of which 20% are topic noise) in 2 minutes and achieves an AMI score of 0.59, in contrast with hdbscan (McInnes et al., 2017), a popular algorithm suited for this type of task, which requires over 7 hours and achieves an AMI of 0.03. Finally, we test FANATIC against a Twitter dataset and \ufb01nd again that it outperforms the other algorithms with an AMI score of 0.60.
