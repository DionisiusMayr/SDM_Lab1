This study identifies widely available (but seldom actually used) variables needed for this process: available instructional workload units and student credits. While doing so, this study also walks through best practices in extracting such variables from administrative systems in repeatable, auditable ways using stock database design tools and methods. Finally, this study (literally) illustrates, in practice, how surfacing such variables in readily interpretable tables, pictures, and interactive dashboards can facilitate their application and use, by providing administrators with ways of presenting these data to peers and oversight boards in transparent, ideologically neutral, but yet actionable, formats. Although this study brings considerable quantitative data to bear, it is, at its core, a practical study in how academic administrators should be managing their data\u2014the \u2018new gold\u2019.", "venue": "Journal of Higher Education Policy and Management", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2021-02-23", "journal": {"name": "Journal of Higher Education Policy and Management", "pages": "607 - 624", "volume": "43"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3117203", "name": "Richard L.
