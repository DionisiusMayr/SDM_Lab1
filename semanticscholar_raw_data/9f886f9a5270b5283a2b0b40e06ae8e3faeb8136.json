In addition, its structure may change over time, and its size can grow to the extremes of Big Data. In terms of research and practical processing, this creates one of the most complex challenges of effective data management. As it is not humanly possible to handle such a complex task manually, in this vision paper, we focus on the area of automatic management of dynamic multi-model Big Data. We envision a framework capable of accepting different levels of user input and different types of data, queries, changes, and propagation strategies and ensuring the preservation of adequate and efficient data access.", "venue": "International Database Engineering and Applications Symposium", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-08-22", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 26th International Database Engineered Applications Symposium"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1722720", "name": "I.
