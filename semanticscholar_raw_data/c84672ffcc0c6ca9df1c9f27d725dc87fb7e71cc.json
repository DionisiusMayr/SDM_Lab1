Our algorithms are easy to implement in either the COMBINING CRCW PRAM or the MPC computing model. For two related algorithms in this class, we obtain \u0398 (lg n) step and \u0398 (m lg n) work bounds.1 For two others, we obtain O(lg2 n) step and O(m lg2 n) work bounds, which are tight for one of them. All our algorithms are simpler than related algorithms in the literature. We also point out some gaps and errors in the analysis of previous algorithms. Our results show that even a basic problem like connected components still has secrets to reveal.", "venue": "ACM Transactions on Parallel Computing", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2018-12-14", "journal": {"name": "ACM Transactions on Parallel Computing", "pages": "1 - 26", "volume": "9"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "36471843", "name": "S.
