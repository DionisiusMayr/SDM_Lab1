Modern massively parallel systems, such as, Spark, organize query answering as a sequence of rounds each consisting of a distinct communication phase followed by a computation phase. The communication phase redistributes data over the available servers, while in the subsequent computation phase each server performs the actual computation on its local data. There is a growing interest in single-round algorithms for evaluating multiway joins where data is first reshuffled over the servers and then evaluated in a parallel but communication-free way. As the amount of communication induced by a reshuffling of the data is a dominating cost in such systems, we introduce a framework for reasoning about data partitioning to detect when we can avoid the data reshuffling step. Specifically, we formalize the decision problems parallel-correctness and transfer of parallel-correctness, provide semantical characterizations, and obtain tight complexity bounds.", "venue": "Communications of the ACM", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2017-02-21", "journal": {"name": "Communications of the ACM", "pages": "93 - 100", "volume": "60"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1785809", "name": "Tom J.
