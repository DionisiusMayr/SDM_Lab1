Recent trends have shown that the mobile industry is amidst a transformation toward platformisation of the key players' business model. This situation puts a traditional business model of mobile network operators (MNOs) under pressure as they failed to catch up due to lesser capabilities for providing a new value proposition and incentives for those sides of the market to achieve the two-sided platform compared to dominated parties. However, the paucity of extant literature has provided practical solutions to enhance MNOs business model leveraging contemporary information technology tools in combination with managerial design principles and concepts. This study investigates the application of Big Data \u2013driven business model in order to transform MNOs from one-sided business model to two-sided business model. The design science research method (DSRM) will be used to build and evaluate the new business model. The proposed model will help the operators better serve their upstream customers and the end-users in order to counter the stiff competition existing in the mobile ecosystem, and contribute to the Big Data - driven business model.", "venue": "", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2017-09-15", "journal": {"name": "Journal of Telecommunication, Electronic and Computer Engineering", "pages": "105-110", "volume": "9"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "66730872", "name": "Aladeen Y.
