This prosperity has significantly improved public service and management, which were traditionally based on manual work. As a notable scenario, librarianship has embraced an era of \u201cSmart Libraries\u201d enabled by AI and IoT. Unlike existing surveys, our work comprehensively overviews the AI- and IoT-based technologies in three fundamental aspects: smart service, smart sustainability, and smart security. We then further highlight the trend towards future smart libraries.", "venue": "Italian National Conference on Sensors", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-04-01", "journal": {"name": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "volume": "22"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2065973106", "name": "Siguo Bi"}, {"authorId": "2162631830", "name": "Cong Wang"}, {"authorId": "2162631401", "name": "Jilong Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2162625432", "name": "Wutao Huang"}, {"authorId": "2153712621", "name": "Bochun Wu"}, {"authorId": "2162735270", "name": "Yi Gong"}, {"authorId": "2162559642", "name": "Wei Ni"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "d6a6c7b2fe4e1c2b7ef354fe096cf6883804c265", "title": "Artificial Intelligence Services at Academic Libraries in Tanzania: Awareness, Adoption and Prospects"}, {"paperId": "bc2daa7f7beb61bc027ffe28c20e3dd4368351d9", "title": "Factors influencing the adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) in university libraries: a systematic literature review (SLR)"}, {"paperId": "1d52f12f0eab5d64a7941fc594a5fbb75b2cb864", "title": "AI in Indian Libraries: Prospects and Perceptions from Library Professionals"}, {"paperId": "b019bdb987f75924845ed9c19c052a2b7a592aaa", "title": "Innovative Livestock: A Survey of Artificial Intelligence Techniques in Livestock Farming Management"}, {"paperId": "a58d4c60914ad99046e15abdf27227159062260a", "title": "From traditional to emerging technologies in supporting smart libraries.
