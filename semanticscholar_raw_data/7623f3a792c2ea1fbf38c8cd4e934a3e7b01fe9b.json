The study of motif discovery is of important significance in environmental management, financial analysis, healthcare, and other fields. With the growth of various information acquisition devices, the number of multi\u2010dimensional time series datasets is rapidly increasing. However, it is difficult to apply traditional multi\u2010dimensional motif discovery methods to large\u2010scale datasets. This paper proposes a novel method for motif discovery and analysis in large\u2010scale multi\u2010dimensional time series. It can effectively find multi\u2010dimensional motifs and the correlation among the motifs. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better performance than the related arts on synthetic and real datasets. It is further validated on practical air quality data and provides theoretical support for real air pollution control in places such as Beijing.", "venue": "Concurrency and Computation", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2019-12-14", "journal": {"name": "Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience", "volume": "32"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2155439609", "name": "Bo Liu"}, {"authorId": "1569901336", "name": "Huaipu Zhao"}, {"authorId": "49420418", "name": "Yinxing Liu"}, {"authorId": "49185019", "name": "Suyu Wang"}, {"authorId": "2108981185", "name": "Jianqiang Li"}, {"authorId": "2154403547", "name": "Yong Li"}, {"authorId": "5020593", "name": "Jianlei Lang"}, {"authorId": "39434830", "name": "Rentao Gu"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "a294fbfec8a7a7ce8987a488e24261a2b7d0eb59", "title": "A deep learning framework with convolutional long short\u2010term memory for influenza\u2010like illness trend estimation"}, {"paperId": "a815f2e033e5071fa18163b79bf54ae45ab37685", "title": "Spatial and Seasonal Characteristics of Air Pollution Spillover in China"}]}
