Among them are the data stream processing systems that are deployed in cloud data centers by companies, such as Twitter, to process billion of events per day in real time. However, studying the energy consumption of such infrastructures is difficult because they rely on a complex virtualized software ecosystem where attributing energy consumption to individual software components is a challenge, and because the space of possible configurations is large. We present GreenFlow, a principled methodology and tool designed to automate the deployment of energy measurement experiments for data stream processing systems in cloud environments. GreenFlow is designed to deliver reproducible results while remaining flexible enough to support a wide range of experiments. We illustrate its usage and show in particular that consolidating a DSP system in the smallest number of servers that are capable of processing it is an effective way to reduce energy consumption.", "venue": "2023 IEEE International Conference on Cloud Engineering (IC2E)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-09-25", "journal": {"name": "2023 IEEE International Conference on Cloud Engineering (IC2E)", "pages": "99-106"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "145074982", "name": "G.
