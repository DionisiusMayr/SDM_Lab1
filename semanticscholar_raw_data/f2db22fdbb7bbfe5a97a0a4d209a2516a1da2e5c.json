On the other hand, data analytic can observe even large data owing to the spread of analysis methods/tools and strong computing power. The critical point for accelerating data utilization is the communication of data stakeholders. Data analysts should consider the purpose for which data holders collect data. However, the communication among stakeholders is hard in case some of them are not familiar with data. Innovators Marketplace on Data Jackets (IMDJ) [5] is a workshop method to tackle this problem. In IMDJ workshop, participants state their requirements and create a scenario for solving these requirements based on Data Jackets. Data Jacket (DJ) [4] is a framework to describe structured information about data in natural language, which enable for those who are not familiar with data to discuss based on data. In this paper, we introduce a platform called Web-IMDJ for conducting IMDJ workshop on the web. Web-IMDJ not only reduces the burden of workshops but enables to participate in workshop remotely. By conducting workshop on Web-IMDJ as case study, we found that the number of ideas is as many as previous IMDJ and the capacity of participants is superior in Web-IMDJ.", "venue": "2018 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW)", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2018-11-01", "journal": {"name": "2018 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW)", "pages": "176-179"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "51417675", "name": "Daiji Iwasa"}], "citations": []}
