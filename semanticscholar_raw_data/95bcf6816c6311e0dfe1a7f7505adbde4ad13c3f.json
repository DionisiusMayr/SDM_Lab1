Characterizing and tuning to run at maximum performance and/or minimum power is a critical business goal for companies.In this paper, we implement and characterize the Virtual Broadband Network Gateway (vBNG), an important NFV workload, running on a real Intel\u00ae Xeon\u00ae server. Then, we present a fully automated approach based on Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO-NFV) for tuning real systems running NFV workloads. We demonstrate improvements in power and performance by up to 18% and 17% respectively. We envision that the proposed methodology and results will benefit service providers for resource planning and orchestration.", "venue": "IFIP/IEEE Symposium on Integrated Network Management", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-05-17", "journal": {"name": "2021 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM)", "pages": "90-98"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2528093", "name": "Pietro Mercati"}, {"authorId": "2156071993", "name": "Bin Li"}, {"authorId": "1786106", "name": "M.
