Several variations of OGTT exists, but the most used in clinical practice is the 2-sample 2-hour OGTT, in which glucose is measured in fasting and two hours after a glucose load. In the 5-sample 2-hour OGTT, glucose is measured in fasting and every 30 minutes after a glucose load, during two hours. In these tests, besides glucose, insulin level can also be measured from the blood samples, increasing thus the number of variables to analyze and perform a better metabolic assessment. In this paper, a cluster analysis is carried using the levels of glucose and insulin from the 2-sample 2-hour OGTT and from the 5-sample 2-hour OGTT, from subjects with metabolic syndrome and professional marathon runners. Different configurations of k-means and agglomerative hierarchical clustering were used to perform the clustering of data and analyze the relationships between clusters with the study groups. Results show that the k-means clustering algorithm performs better than the agglomerative hierarchical clustering, and, with the Manhattan distance measure, k-means perfectly groups subjects using the ten variables from the 5-sample 2-hour OGTT.", "venue": "", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2018-12-27", "journal": {"name": "Applied Medical Informatics", "pages": "54-62", "volume": "40"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2141323", "name": "M.
