This can be quite the task for humans to maintain and monitor and as a result, our society has become reliant on machine learning to assist in this task. With new technology comes new methods and thus new ways to circumvent existing cyber security measures. This study examines the effectiveness of three distinct Internet of Things cyber security algorithms currently used in industry today for malware and intrusion detection: Random Forest (RF), Support-Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). Each algorithm was trained and tested on the Aposemat IoT-23 dataset which was published in January 2020 with the earliest of captures from 2018 and latest from 2019. The RF, SVM, and KNN reached peak accuracies of 92.96%, 86.23%, and 91.48%, respectively, in intrusion detection and 92.27%, 83.52%, and 89.80% in malware detection. It was found all three algorithms are capable of being effectively utilized for the current landscape of IoT cyber security in 2021.", "venue": "Journal of Computer Sciences and Applications", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-10-15", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2110.07832"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2133141338", "name": "Sam Strecker"}, {"authorId": "51288952", "name": "Rushit Dave"}, {"authorId": "2133144059", "name": "Nyle Siddiqui"}, {"authorId": "1809915", "name": "Naeem Seliya"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "2aff1f8b99171c5a7c5f2f87c99bdec865d9b6fa", "title": "Anomaly Detection of Smart City in IoT Cyberattacks based on Hybrid A-BiLSTM-CRF Method"}, {"paperId": "8700d2534d0c728528b7fa349726b307b7f8821d", "title": "Enhancing Cybersecurity: A Pipeline Approach for Efficient Machine Learning Intrusion Detection"}, {"paperId": "f431aa80c4d902860087ef76e4fbced1075b4dc4", "title": "Your Identity is Your Behavior - Continuous User Authentication based on Machine Learning and Touch Dynamics"}, {"paperId": "aca34fa3f9d2b780bac526e62fd227026647e1ce", "title": "Energy Analysis-Based Cyber Attack Detection by IoT with Artificial Intelligence in a Sustainable Smart City"}, {"paperId": "99773fe8d62c8f38c3deee545b7b2916da77014b", "title": "An artificial intelligence lightweight blockchain security model for security and privacy in IIoT systems"}, {"paperId": "7181e714ff865b51f961b6bb73ac9bb8cd35c42c", "title": "Deepfake Detection Analyzing Hybrid Dataset Utilizing CNN and SVM"}, {"paperId": "fc06e7e42a02a411aaa6cd47e03ef9a6ff21d079", "title": "Distributed Deep Neural-Network-Based Middleware for Cyber-Attacks Detection in Smart IoT Ecosystem: A Novel Framework and Performance Evaluation Approach"}, {"paperId": "d2fe2cb20f42fd0f6fb55cc4ba04876f631af87f", "title": "An Examination on Implementation of Deep Fake in Images Through Deep Learning"}, {"paperId": "73811b98ac44e6c8a76123279c590433bc9faae9", "title": "Artificial Intelligence Enabled Middleware for Distributed Cyberattacks Detection in IoT-based Smart Environments"}, {"paperId": "27fc826988849445a8d994bd71ca543f7d3a2982", "title": "Biometric Authentication-Based Intrusion Detection Using Artificial Intelligence Internet of Things in Smart City"}, {"paperId": "b28c05377b68f1b291b8555507ea67fa5b33bcb4", "title": "Continuous User Authentication Using Machine Learning and Multi-finger Mobile Touch Dynamics with a Novel Dataset"}, {"paperId": "fd1e414ed6ec99e229be71391c827ad1449d88a3", "title": "Using Deep Learning to Detecting Deepfakes"}, {"paperId": "f033c9e2bfa81df46e4165d824edb9baf8d07cd7", "title": "Mitigating Presentation Attack using DCGAN and Deep CNN"}, {"paperId": "81e04590b372c21dd8a63a0c14c27eb8821fadb9", "title": "Evaluation of a User Authentication Schema Using Behavioral Biometrics and Machine Learning"}, {"paperId": "23e2ca11cad86b350e3168850b180d865b234b0b", "title": "A Close Look into Human Activity Recognition Models using Deep Learning"}, {"paperId": "6d07a53f872e8631eda3e911978931ddfa59929d", "title": "Exploration of Machine Learning Classification Models Used for Behavioral Biometrics Authentication"}, {"paperId": "bc403590fcb9b6fbc6548af5b0b9cea639510156", "title": "A Robust Framework for Deep Learning Approaches to Facial Emotion Recognition and Evaluation"}, {"paperId": "4d7fb25a7f9c37f7192ccf459c1782ddeca54041", "title": "Hold On and Swipe: A Touch-Movement Based Continuous Authentication Schema based on Machine Learning"}, {"paperId": "588a314595d4fa5b6ac9eeb9e0d1bfaf06c30e70", "title": "Human Activity Recognition models using Limited Consumer Device Sensors and Machine Learning"}, {"paperId": "d964b0223dca6ba11d563bc2803c612bf7187a82", "title": "Predicting Malicious Software in IoT Environment Based on Machine Learning and Data Mining Techniques"}, {"paperId": "17a9c11a8b35f583ed3e4a94ce51c2e19e39e770", "title": "Machine Learning-based Detection of DoS and DRDoS Attacks in IoT Networks"}]}
