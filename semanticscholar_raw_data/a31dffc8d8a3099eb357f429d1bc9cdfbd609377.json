However, as scientific workflows are becoming more complex, application developers are becoming more prone to making wrong caching decisions, which we refer to as\n caching anomalies\n , that lead to poor performance. We present and give a demonstration of\n Spark Caching Anomalies Detector (SparkCAD)\n , a developer decision support tool that visualizes the logical plan of Spark applications and detects caching anomalies.\n", "venue": "Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-08-01", "journal": {"name": "Proc.
