The data generated between learners and learning interaction activities can reflect the online learning behaviors. Through the correlation analysis among learning interaction activities, this paper discusses the potential association rules, defines the data structures, mines the frequent item sets, and designs appropriate algorithms, then recommend learning decision makings based on association rules. The research methods and conclusions can provide feasible educational decision makings for the realization of personalization, probability prediction and decision feedback, which will improve the interactive learning environment, the algorithms, methods and modes designed in this paper are useful supplements for learning analytics.", "venue": "Interactive Learning Environments", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-08-04", "journal": {"name": "Interactive Learning Environments", "pages": "593 - 608", "volume": "31"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1807986", "name": "Xiaona Xia"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "37574974d993c232a687c0d40d3131418bc93598", "title": "Machine Learning Aided Design and Optimization of Thermal Metamaterials."}, {"paperId": "0983a36da068244f76db5f8c62b4fe9feee7e0c0", "title": "Driving STEM learning effectiveness: dropout prediction and intervention in MOOCs based on one novel behavioral data analysis approach"}, {"paperId": "04f8284b9c8bb5d811d768bab953cf35121b6d0e", "title": "One improved learning analytics of interest transfer in interactive learning activities"}, {"paperId": "bab9e7ba26ee8aeb61f8209e126819012c6c9244", "title": "Comparative Analysis of Teachers\u2019 Assessments on the Traditional and Digital Educational Activities in a Resilient School"}, {"paperId": "826c1938c249690290136af3498be4fa03814505", "title": "Interactive learning environment for the sporting skills development of physical education students"}, {"paperId": "e034f95d618203ded410755293fde3525deedb2e", "title": "Dropout prediction and decision feedback supported by multi temporal sequences of learning behavior in MOOCs"}, {"paperId": "d43000e9421505e6760d63876555524b7bc7e710", "title": "Interpretable early warning recommendations in interactive learning environments: a deep-neural network approach based on learning behavior knowledge graph"}, {"paperId": "a99d6defd26ad84f6091b4cbc2ed96d378527b7e", "title": "The Study of Hierarchical Learning Behaviors and Interactive Cooperation Based on Feature Clusters"}, {"paperId": "ba87afe587e0ac466774fce0555dff2082c6db72", "title": "Multi Objective Evaluation Between Learning Behavior and Learning Achievement"}, {"paperId": "66234d4ee4455aee8d5744702247ab6aedb50a10", "title": "Gold-Price Forecasting Method Using Long Short-Term Memory and the Association Rule"}, {"paperId": "0ecd3ca9381d284bd8cd41a8cb3d0e51bb0bfd9d", "title": "Early warning mechanism of interactive learning process based on temporal memory enhancement model"}, {"paperId": "e16b046c6398a454d940174795c92fa3456db954", "title": "College education: Problem-solving creativity in an interactive learning environment"}, {"paperId": "62a617811751085067abda38d8e18ec8e12deea1", "title": "Diversion inference model of learning effectiveness supported by differential evolution strategy"}, {"paperId": "0fe42856ce2d5dbae0c4206d3f1677e71fedcd93", "title": "Application Technology on Collaborative Training of Interactive Learning Activities and Tendency Preference Diversion"}, {"paperId": "cb4b1686b3fcbafe74f6362359d05e946d9701b4", "title": "A ENGENHARIA DO CONHECIMENTO NAS INSTITUI\u00c7\u00d5ES DE ENSINO: UMA REVIS\u00c3O INTEGRATIVA"}, {"paperId": "eb16c7e1f9b38097a215219734cf70a6fc38dc20", "title": "Temporal tracking and early warning of multi semantic features of learning behavior"}, {"paperId": "cc2b3fcebec3c389c4f64cc8e711a7be4285373a", "title": "Modeling personalized representation for within-basket recommendation based on deep learning"}, {"paperId": "d2aaa72bd98aa1515b35167f45607de48803ac4d", "title": "Sparse learning strategy and key feature selection in interactive learning environment"}, {"paperId": "17fe0ece4c9f198a76c9ece53551c0362a666693", "title": "Improved Probabilistic Frequent Itemset Analysis Strategy of Learning Behaviors Based on Eclat Framework"}, {"paperId": "b46901708287c21011e140b90742bb6ec55f95ce", "title": "Decision application mechanism of regression analysis of multi-category learning behaviors in interactive learning environment"}, {"paperId": "9a571b1a721369a1eee1bb50e047cd98f2e036ad", "title": "Interaction recognition and intervention based on context feature fusion of learning behaviors in interactive learning environments"}, {"paperId": "2b0228665d244df929c240b1096b3ef6eec62e22", "title": "SOCIAL MEDIA INTERDISCIPLINARITY IN MULTIMODALITY OF ARTS AND CULTURE EDUCATION FOR MILLENIALS"}, {"paperId": "7bb5fa841db34cc93ed6be91497529c8a8ae67f7", "title": "Random field design and collaborative inference strategies for learning interaction activities"}, {"paperId": "8bdfba22a92736a57b252abbe3069e19eccd5b25", "title": "CR-LCRP: Course recommendation based on Learner\u2013Course Relation Prediction with data augmentation in a heterogeneous view"}, {"paperId": "98344938603907f90e002d7f7647486e7d626836", "title": "Using Innovative Technologies In Medical Education Of Ukraine Under Martial Law"}]}
