These data are undoubtedly of great value but need to be first well stored and then analyzed. Nevertheless, traditional relational database management system (RDBMS) is not well qualified for this job. As a result, NoSQL databases are proposed and become very popular. Judging from the present situations, RDMBSs play a better role in managing relational data, and thus application developers have to face the situation of co-existence of both RDBMS and NoSQL databases, and knowing the details of the underlying data distributions and structures of different databases. To this end, in this paper, we aim to propose a unified, transparent query engine, as a middleware, called \"ZQL\", by using MySQL and Hive as underlying two exemplary databases, however its usage goes far beyond these two databases. ZQL aims to support application development by hiding the specific details of both NoSQL databases and RDBMS. Finally, extensive experimental results show the effectiveness and functionalities of the proposed and implemented ZQL middleware.", "venue": "2016 IEEE 14th Intl Conf on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing, 14th Intl Conf on Pervasive Intelligence and Computing, 2nd Intl Conf on Big Data Intelligence and Computing and Cyber Science and Technology Congress(DASC/PiCom/DataCom/CyberSciTech)", "year": 2016, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2016-08-01", "journal": {"name": "2016 IEEE 14th Intl Conf on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing, 14th Intl Conf on Pervasive Intelligence and Computing, 2nd Intl Conf on Big Data Intelligence and Computing and Cyber Science and Technology Congress(DASC/PiCom/DataCom/CyberSciTech)", "pages": "730-737"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2145754352", "name": "Jie Xu"}, {"authorId": "2113796756", "name": "Mengji Shi"}, {"authorId": "2145764956", "name": "Chao-Yuan Chen"}, {"authorId": "2116701774", "name": "Zhen Zhang"}, {"authorId": "3036636", "name": "Jigao Fu"}, {"authorId": "144212455", "name": "C.
