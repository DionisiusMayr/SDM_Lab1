This study compares LBW between healthy and processed dietary patterns by focusing on women of advanced maternal age. A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 327 postpartum women in Taiwan. The participants were assigned to two groups according to their age (\u226535 years, n = 151; and 20\u201334 years, n = 176). An online questionnaire asked women how often they consumed 27 food items during their pregnancy. The prevalence of LBW was higher in the processed dietary pattern (79.3%) than in the healthy pattern (13.78%, p < 0.001). LBW was positively correlated with advanced maternal age (\u226535 ages), low pre-pregnancy weight (BMI less than 18.5 kg/m2), insufficient gestational weight gain (GWG), and processed dietary patterns. Older mothers were 5.8 times more likely to have infants with LBW (odds ratio = 5.8; 95% confidence interval 2.0\u201316.6). A processed dietary pattern was 9.4 times more likely to result in LBW. Insufficient GWG was significantly positively associated with LBW (OR = 4.0; 95%CI 1.4\u201311.6). Maternal diet during pregnancy is an important modifiable factor for LBW. Prenatal advice should emphasize optimal nutrition, especially in older and underweight women.", "venue": "Nutrients", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-08-01", "journal": {"name": "Nutrients", "volume": "14"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2110515249", "name": "Tzu-Ling Chen"}, {"authorId": "49400859", "name": "Su-Fen Cheng"}, {"authorId": "144630407", "name": "M.
