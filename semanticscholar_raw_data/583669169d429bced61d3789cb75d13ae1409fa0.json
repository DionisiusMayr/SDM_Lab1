For the realization of this task at the edge using the current de-facto standard approach, i.e., deep learning, it is critical to optimize key performance metrics such as throughput and energy consumption according to prescribed application requirements. This allows achieving timely decision-making while extending the battery lifetime as much as possible. In this context, we propose a method to boost neural-network performance based on a co-execution strategy that exploits hardware heterogeneity on edge platforms. The enabling tool is Apache TVM, a highly efficient machine-learning compiler compatible with a diversity of hardware back-ends. The proposed approach solves the problem of network partitioning and distributes the workloads to make concurrent use of all the processors available on the board following a pipeline scheme. We conducted experiments on various popular CNNs compiled with TVM on the Jetson TX2 platform. The experimental results based on measurements show a significant improvement in throughput with respect to a single-processor execution, ranging from 14% to 150% over all tested networks. Power-efficient configurations were also identified, accomplishing energy reductions above 10%.", "venue": "IEEE Access", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "IEEE Access", "pages": "35007-35021", "volume": "11"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1414138785", "name": "Delia Velasco-Montero"}, {"authorId": "144636630", "name": "B.
