Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) allows a VM to be deployed, launched, and managed over a cluster of servers. Efficient VM assignment is often regarded as one of the most challenging issues for CPs to conquer because to the inherent tension between the goals of improving customer demand fulfilment while cutting costs and maximising asset efficiency. The purpose of this work is to provide a novel approach to allocating virtual machines to meet the needs of individual customers by using the modified emperor penguin optimization method algorithm. Relying on established optimization methods for efficient VM allocation further demonstrates the value of the suggested approach. This application was built using the Java programming language and deployed to the Netbeans IDE 12.4.", "venue": "2022 Second International Conference on Advanced Technologies in Intelligent Control, Environment, Computing & Communication Engineering (ICATIECE)", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-12-16", "journal": {"name": "2022 Second International Conference on Advanced Technologies in Intelligent Control, Environment, Computing & Communication Engineering (ICATIECE)", "pages": "1-5"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "73463418", "name": "Vikrant Sharma"}, {"authorId": "114410535", "name": "Shambhu Bhardwaj"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "46b6cdb42a75dcd3c8318acff06d6275a7dd6907", "title": "Comprehensive Exploration of Dynamic Resource Distribution in Cloud-Based Virtual Environments"}]}
