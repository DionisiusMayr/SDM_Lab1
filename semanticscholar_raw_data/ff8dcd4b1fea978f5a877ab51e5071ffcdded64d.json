Data flow programs provide opportunities for parallel optimization for multi-core processors, but communication and synchronization between processors brings a large performance overhead to the program. In the shared disk structure SD, the processors share all the disk memories, each processor has an independent main memory, and the communication between processors can be realized indirectly through disk storage or directly through the high-speed communication network. Hence, with this basis models, this paper proposes the novel network teaching innovation platform based on Yiban and parallel data stream sorting algorithm. The algorithm is tested on the collected database and the systematci simulation has proven the effectiveness.", "venue": "2022 International Conference on Augmented Intelligence and Sustainable Systems (ICAISS)", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-11-24", "journal": {"name": "2022 International Conference on Augmented Intelligence and Sustainable Systems (ICAISS)", "pages": "552-555"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2201687511", "name": "Yang Ling"}], "citations": []}
