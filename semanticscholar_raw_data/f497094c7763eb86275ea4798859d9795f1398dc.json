Recent work on learned query optimization have shown that it is possible for a query optimizer to\"learn from its mistakes,\"correcting erroneous query plans the next time a plan is produced. But what if query optimizers could avoid mistakes entirely? This paper presents the idea of learned query superoptimization. A new generation of query superoptimizers could autonomously experiment to discover optimal plans using exploration-driven algorithms, iterative Bayesian optimization, and program synthesis. While such superoptimizers will take significantly longer to optimize a given query, superoptimizers have the potential to massively accelerate a large number of important repetitive queries being executed on data systems today.", "venue": "VLDB Workshops", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-03-27", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2303.15308"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "40412858", "name": "Ryan Marcus"}], "citations": []}
