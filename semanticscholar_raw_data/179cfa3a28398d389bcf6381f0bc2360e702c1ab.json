More precisely, it shows how data structures can be modeled by functors related by natural transformations (and isomorphisms). The transformation functions can then serve to shift a data structure and then get another program (eventually educing time complexity). The paper then explains the main concepts of the theory, how to apply them and gives an application to a concrete database and the performances obtained.", "venue": "BigData Congress [Services Society]", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2018-07-01", "journal": {"name": "2018 IEEE International Congress on Big Data (BigData Congress)", "pages": "272-275"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "34709050", "name": "Laurent Thiry"}, {"authorId": "2112151967", "name": "Heng Zhao"}, {"authorId": "2311974", "name": "M.
