This article presents a holistic review of cybersecurity attacks on sensors and threats regarding multi\u2010modal sensor fusion. A comprehensive review of cyberattacks on intra\u2010vehicle and inter\u2010vehicle communications is presented afterward. Besides the analysis of conventional cybersecurity threats and countermeasures for CAV systems, a detailed review of modern machine learning, federated learning, and blockchain approach is also conducted to safeguard CAVs. Machine learning and data mining\u2010aided intrusion detection systems and other countermeasures dealing with these challenges are elaborated at the end of the related section. In the last section, research challenges and future directions are identified.", "venue": "WIREs Data. Mining. Knowl.
