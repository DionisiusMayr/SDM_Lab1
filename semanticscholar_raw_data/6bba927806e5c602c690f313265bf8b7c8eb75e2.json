This paper proposes a technique for computing well-known ML explanations from the literature using provenance. Observing that widely used ML models can be expressed into a set of Datalog queries, we develop a technique that rewrites the query to capture provenance and computes explanations based on that while training the model. The preliminary evaluation shows the reasonable computational cost of our algorithm.", "venue": "2023 IEEE 39th International Conference on Data Engineering Workshops (ICDEW)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-04-01", "journal": {"name": "2023 IEEE 39th International Conference on Data Engineering Workshops (ICDEW)", "pages": "40-43"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2220063966", "name": "J.
