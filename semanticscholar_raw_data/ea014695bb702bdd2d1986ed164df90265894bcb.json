However, the performance of Hadoop and indeed HDFS has some limitations and remains an open problem in the research community. The ultimate goal of our research is to develop an adaptive replication system; this paper presents the first phase of the work - an investigation into the replication factor used in HDFS to determine whether increasing the replication factor for in-demand data can improve the performance of the system. We constructed a physical Hadoop cluster for our experimental environment, using TestDFSIO and both the real world and the synthetic data sets, NOAA and TPC-H, with Hive to validate our proposal. Results show that increasing the replication factor of the \u00bbhot\u00bb data increases the availability and locality of the data, and thus, decreases the job execution time.", "venue": "ICPE Companion", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book"], "publicationDate": "2018-04-02", "journal": {"name": "Companion of the 2018 ACM/SPEC International Conference on Performance Engineering"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "40930805", "name": "Hilmi Egemen Ciritoglu"}, {"authorId": "3044829", "name": "Leandro Batista de Almeida"}, {"authorId": "145736838", "name": "E.
