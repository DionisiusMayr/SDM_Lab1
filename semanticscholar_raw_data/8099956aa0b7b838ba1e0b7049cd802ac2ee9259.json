Real time data is made\navailable in World Wide Web (WWW) and social media.\nEspecially social media data is rich in opinions of people of all\nwalks of life. Searching and analysing such data provides\nrequired business intelligence (BI) for applications of various\ndomains in the real world. The application may be in the area of\npolitics or banking or insurance or healthcare industry. With the\nemergence of cloud computing, volumes of data are added to\ncloud storage infrastructure and it is growing exponentially. In\nthis context, Elasticsearch is the distributed search and analytics\nengine that is very crucial part of Elastic Stack. For data\ncollection, aggregation and enriching it Beats and Logstash are\nused and such data is stored in Elasticsearch. For interactive\nexploration and visualization Kibana is used. Elasticsearch helps\nin indexing of data, searching efficiently and performing data\nanalytics. In this paper, the utility of Elasticsearch is evaluated\nfor optimising search and data analytics of Twitter data.\nEmpirical study is made with the Elasticsearch tool configured\nfor Windows and also using Amazon Elasticsearch and the\nresults are compared with state of art. The experimental results\nrevealed that the Elasticsearch performs better than the existing\nones.", "venue": "Regular", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2020-08-30", "journal": {"name": "Regular"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "47982705", "name": "Subhani Shaik"}, {"authorId": "2286512200", "name": "N.
