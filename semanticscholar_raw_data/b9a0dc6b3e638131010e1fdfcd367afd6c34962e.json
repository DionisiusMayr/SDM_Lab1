Combining the heterogeneous characteristics of cloud segments, we present a novel approach for distributed model training strategies by using the federated learning technique. This approach can keep the accuracy of the model, enhance training efficiency, and protect user privacy. The experiment demonstrates that the proposed strategy outperforms the baseline method, which does not account for variations in different segments.", "venue": "2023 9th International Conference on Big Data and Information Analytics (BigDIA)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-12-15", "journal": {"name": "2023 9th International Conference on Big Data and Information Analytics (BigDIA)", "pages": "392-397"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2284448007", "name": "Yaoyu Li"}, {"authorId": "2284644461", "name": "Shuai Jin"}, {"authorId": "2284396807", "name": "Jianghan Zhu"}], "citations": []}
