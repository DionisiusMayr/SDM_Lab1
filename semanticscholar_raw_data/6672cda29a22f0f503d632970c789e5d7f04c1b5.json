Theoretical research is the basis for obtaining practical results. Special attention is paid to the calculations of critical components and parts. By means of the stand, cars, locomotives, electric locomotives and other rolling stock can be brought into working condition. The purpose of the work is to develop a stand for maintenance and repair of railway equipment units. The object of the study is the technological process of the stand for the maintenance and repair of railway equipment units. The scientific novelty of the work is: theoretical justification of the stand design parameters; design and technological scheme of the stand; optimal design and operating parameters of the stand; estimated performance indicators of the stand. The practical significance lies in the use of the stand on the repair sections of the railway, reducing the labor intensity of the work performed, ease of maintenance, and the lowest cost of manufacturing. Theoretical methods were based on the principles of classical mechanics, mathematical analysis, synthesis, modeling, etc. Experimental data processing was performed using the application programs \u201cCompass-3D\u201d, Statistica 6.0, MathCAD. Calculations of the metal structure for bending strength, welded joints, and bed clamps were performed. The calculation of the bending strength of the metal structure was performed and the maximum stresses were found to be within the permissible limits. The condition for the strength of the welded joint is met. The calculation of the bed clips showed that the condition of wear resistance is met.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2020-08-21", "journal": {"name": "", "pages": "210-215", "volume": "1"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2005647654", "name": "\u0421. \u041f. \u041b\u044b\u0441\u044b\u0439"}, {"authorId": "2097938152", "name": "\u0418. \u0410. \u041f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430"}, {"authorId": "2005632172", "name": "\u041c. \u0410. \u0412\u0438\u0448\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0430"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "0bddbbeb21df1bb8f05cd620a0de7f04c1b81e84", "title": "Determination of common features and classification of fitting stops for flat cars"}, {"paperId": "db2adb521fd1776d11e2ca3f4eedde3315782199", "title": "\u0421\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0434 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0438\u0441\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043c\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0436\u043a\u0438 \u0433\u0440\u0443\u0437\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0432\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043d\u0430"}, {"paperId": "d82acb88a20738d10186082a0b4cdb1e66e72739", "title": "Theoretical study of bench parameters for repair of railway equipment units"}, {"paperId": "32e7e995dc856df13a1e748510264db216b7d362", "title": "Theoretical studies of the reliability of the gear mechanism of a two-speed gearbox of KGT-4RS hybrid road-rail backhoe loader"}]}
