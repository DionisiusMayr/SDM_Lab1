While firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and similar appliances introduce essential checks, their efficacy depends on the attackers\u2019 ability to bypass such middleboxes. We propose a provenance solution to enable the verification of an end-to-end message delivery path and the actions performed on a message. Fast and flexible provenance verification (F2-Pro) provides cryptographically verifiable evidence that a message has originated from a legitimate source and gone through the necessary checks before reaching its destination. F2-Prorelies on lightweight cryptographic primitives and flexibly supports various communication settings and protocols encountered in ICS thanks to its transparent, bump-in-the-wire design. We provide formal definitions and cryptographically prove F2-Pro\u2019s security. For human interaction with ICS via a field service device, F2-Profeatures a multi-factor authentication mechanism that starts the provenance chain from a human user issuing commands. We compatibility tested F2-Proon a smart power grid testbed and reported a sub-millisecond latency overhead per communication hop using a modest ARM Cortex-A15 processor.", "venue": "ACM Trans.
