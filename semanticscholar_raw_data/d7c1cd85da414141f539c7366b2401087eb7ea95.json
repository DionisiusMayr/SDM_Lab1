Geospatial big data comprises a big portion of big data, and is essential and powerful for decision-making if being utilized strategically. Volumes in size and high dimensions are two of the major challenges that prevent strategic decision-making from (geospatial) big data. Interactive map-based and geovisualization enabled web applications are intuitive and useful to construct knowledge and reveal insights from high-dimensional (geospatial) big data for actionable decision-making. We propose an interactive and data-driven web mapping framework, named idwMapper, for visualizing and sensing high dimensional geospatial (big) data in an interactive and scalable manner. To demonstrate the wide applicability and usefulness of our framework, we have applied our idwMapper framework to three real-world case studies and implemented three corresponding web map applications: iLit4GEE-AI, iWURanking, and iTRELISmap. We expect and hope the three web maps demonstrated in different domains, from literature big data analysis through world university ranking to scholar mapping, will provide a good start and inspire researchers and practitioners in various domains to apply our idwMapper to solve (or at least aid them in solving) their impactful problems.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-02-16", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2402.11001"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2159771662", "name": "Sarigai Sarigai"}, {"authorId": "2243104721", "name": "Liping Yang"}, {"authorId": "2284685016", "name": "Katie Slack"}, {"authorId": "2284687052", "name": "K.
