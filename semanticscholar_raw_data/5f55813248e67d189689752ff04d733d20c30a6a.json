However, in federated learning, membership inference is still under-explored due to several issues. For instance, some assumptions in prior works may not be practical in federated learning. Most existing membership inference methods stand on those impractical assumptions or lack generalization ability, which may misestimate the privacy risk. To address these issues, we propose CMI, an attack framework armed by a targeted poisoning method, to conduct a critical evaluation of client-targeted membership inference in federated learning. Under CMI, we consider a strong adversary, refine the prior impractical assumptions, and apply simple but generalizable attack methods. The evaluation results on multiple datasets demonstrate the efficacy of CMI under identically independently distributed (i.i.d.) and non-i.i.d. settings. In terms of the defenses, although differetially private stochatic gradient descent (DP-SGD) is effective under the i.i.d. setting, it does not provide satisfactory protection under label-biased non-i.i.d. settings. Thus, we propose RR-Label, a modified random response algorithm, to defend against membership inference. Compared to DP-SGD and Random Response Top-k (RRTop-k), RR-Label enables a better trade-off between model utility and defensive performance under label-biased non-i.i.d. settings.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1557274576", "name": "Tianhang Zheng"}, {"authorId": "2257437432", "name": "Baochun Li"}], "citations": []}
