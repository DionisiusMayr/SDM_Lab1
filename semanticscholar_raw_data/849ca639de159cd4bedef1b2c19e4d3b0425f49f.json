One of the most important factors to consider during the process of cooperation among systems is trust. Trust is a social concept that assumes that cooperation with an object will produce positive results in the direction we intend. Our objectives are to propose a method for defining trust during the requirements engineering phase in the process of developing self-adaptive systems and to define the trust evidence models required to evaluate the defined trust at runtime. To achieve this objective, we propose in this study a provenance-based trust-aware requirement engineering framework for self-adaptive systems. The framework helps system engineers derive the user\u2019s requirements as a trust-aware goal model through analysis of the trust concept in the requirements engineering process. We also propose a provenance-based trust evidence model to evaluate trust and provide a method for defining this model for the target domain. Through the proposed framework, a system engineer can treat trust as a factor emerging from the requirements engineering phase for the self-adaptive system and understand the factors affecting trust using the standardized format.", "venue": "Italian National Conference on Sensors", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-05-01", "journal": {"name": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "volume": "23"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2729818", "name": "Hyo-Cheol Lee"}, {"authorId": "47090245", "name": "Seok-Won Lee"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "93de792947328525cf0f0b36307a5fcd1fe9297e", "title": "Pengaruh Kebijakan Privasi, dan Tingkat Kepercayaan Pada Platform Digital terhadap Perilaku Pengguna dalam Melindungi Privasi Online di Indonesia"}]}
