And it is extremely difficult, if feasible, to manually tune these configuration parameters for optimal performance. In this paper, we propose ACS to tune the configuration of Apache Structured Streaming programs automatically. ACS includes two key technologies: 1) Support Vector Machine (SVM) is leveraged to accurately build a performance model; 2) Genetic Algorithm (GA) is employed to realise the optimal configurations searching. We adopt four typical structured streaming programs for performance evaluation. The results show that compared to the default configurations recommended by official guidelines, ACS improves the throughput by an average of 2.29\u00d7 and up to 2.52\u00d7, and reduces the latency by an average of 3.08\u00d7 and up to 3.96\u00d7.", "venue": "2020 6th International Conference on Big Data and Information Analytics (BigDIA)", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2020-12-01", "journal": {"name": "2020 6th International Conference on Big Data and Information Analytics (BigDIA)", "pages": "199-206"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2044334672", "name": "Jinhan Xin"}, {"authorId": "2145762943", "name": "Chao Chen"}, {"authorId": "2067381875", "name": "Xing Lian"}, {"authorId": "40072305", "name": "Zheng Wang"}, {"authorId": "2047908098", "name": "Yongkui Yang"}, {"authorId": "145202330", "name": "Zhibin Yu"}], "citations": []}
