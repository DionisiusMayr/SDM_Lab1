An (\u03b5, k, z)-coreset for this problem is a weighted point set P* such that an optimal solution for the k-center problem with z outliers on P* gives a (1 \u00b1 \u03b5)-approximation for the k-center problem with z outliers on P. We study the construction of such coresets in the Massively Parallel Computing (MPC) model, and in the insertion-only as well as the fully dynamic streaming model. We obtain the following results, for any given 0 < \u03b5 \u2a7d 1: In all cases, the size of the computed coreset is O(k/\u03b5d + z).\u2022 In the MPC model the data are distributed over m machines. One is the coordinator machine, which will contain the final answer, the others are worker machines.We present a deterministic 2-round algorithm using $O(\\sqrt n )$ machines, where the worker machines have $O(\\sqrt {nk/{\\varepsilon ^d}} + \\sqrt n \\cdot \\log (z + 1))$ local memory, and the coordinator has $O(\\sqrt {nk/{\\varepsilon ^d}} + \\sqrt n \\cdot \\log (z + 1) + z)$ local memory. The algorithm can handle point sets P that are distributed arbitrarily (possibly adversarially) over the machines. We also present a randomized algorithm that uses only a single round, under the assumption that the input set P is initially distributed randomly over the machines. Then we present a deterministic algorithm that obtains a trade-off between the number of rounds, R, and the storage per machine.In the streaming model we have a single machine with limited storage, and P is revealed in a streaming fashion.\u25cb We present the first lower bound for the insertion-only streaming model, where the points arrive one by one and no points are deleted. We show that any deterministic algorithm that maintains an (\u03b5, k, z)-coreset must use \u03a9(k/\u03b5d + z) space. We complement this by a deterministic streaming algorithm using O(k/\u03b5d + z) space, which is thus optimal. \u25cb For the fully dynamic data streams, where points can be inserted as well as deleted we give a randomized algorithm for point sets from a d-dimensional discrete Euclidean space [\u0394]d, where \u0394 \u2208 \u2115 indicates the size of the universe from which the coordinates are taken. Our algorithm uses only O((k/\u03b5d + z)log4(k\u0394/\u03b5\u03b4)) space, and it is the first algorithm for this setting. We also present an \u03a9((k/\u03b5d)log\u0394 + z) lower bound for deterministic fully dynamic streaming algorithms. \u25cb For the sliding-window model, we show that any deterministic streaming algorithm that guarantees a (1 + \u03b5)-approximation for the k-center problem with outliers in \u211dd must use \u03a9((kz/\u03b5d) log\u03c3) space, where \u03c3 is the ratio of the largest and smallest distance between any two points in the stream.
