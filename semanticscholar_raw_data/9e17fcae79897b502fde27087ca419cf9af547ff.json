Unauthorized accessing of data occurs due to the preservation of Identity and information of the users either at the endpoints or at the middleware. This paper proposes a methodology to protect and preserve the Identity during data transmission of the users. It uses fog computing for storage against security issues in the cloud and database environment. Cloud and database architectures failed to protect the data and Identity of users but the Fog computing based Identity management as a service (IDaaS) system can handle it with Security Assertion Mark-up Language (SAML) protocol and Pentatope based Elliptic Curve Crypto cipher. A detailed comparative study of the proposed and existing techniques is investigated by considering multi-authentication dialogue, security services, service providers, Identity, and access management.", "venue": "IEEE Access", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "IEEE Access", "pages": "168793-168801", "volume": "8"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3071631", "name": "C.
