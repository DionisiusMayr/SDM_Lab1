The technique of bibliometric review has been extensively applied to the AI and BDA literature to map out existing scholarships. We summarise 711 bibliometric articles on AI & its sub-sets and BDA published in multiple fields to identify academic disciplines with significant research contributions. We pulled bibliometric review papers from the Scopus Q1 and Q2 journal database published between 2012 and 2022. The Scopus database returned 711 documents published in journals of different disciplines from 59 countries, averaging 17.9 citations per year. Multiple software and Database Analysers were used to investigate the data and illustrate the most active scientific bibliometric indicators such as authors and co-authors, citations, co-citations, countries, institutions, journal sources, and subject areas. The USA was the most influential nation (101 documents; 5405 citations), while China was the most productive nation (204 documents; 2371 citations). The most productive institution was Symbiosis International University, India (32 documents; 4.5%). The results reveal a substantial increase in bibliometric reviews in five clusters of disciplines: (a) Business & Management, (b) Engineering and Construction, (c) Healthcare, (d) Sustainable Operations & I4.0, and (e) Tourism and Hospitality Studies, the majority of which investigate the applications and use cases of AI and BDA to address real-world problems in the field. The keyword co-occurrence in the past bibliometric analyses indicates that BDA, AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP, Fuzzy Logic, and Expert Systems will remain conspicuous research areas in these five diverse clusters of domain areas. Therefore, this paper summarises the bibliometric reviews on AI and BDA in the fields of Business, Engineering, Healthcare, Sustainable Operations, and Hospitality Tourism and serves as a starting point for novice and experienced researchers interested in these topics.", "venue": "Sustainability", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-02-22", "journal": {"name": "Sustainability"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2087525021", "name": "P.
