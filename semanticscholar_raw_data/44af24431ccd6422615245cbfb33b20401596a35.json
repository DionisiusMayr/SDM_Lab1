This big amount of data is exploited by several cloud-based applications to deliver effective and customized services to end users. In order to provide a good user experience, a low-latency response time is needed, both when data are retrieved and provided. To achieve this goal, current geospatial applications need to exploit efficient and scalable geospatial databases, the choice of which has a high impact on the overall performance of the deployed applications. In this paper, we compare, from a qualitative point of view, four state-of-the-art SQL and NoSQL databases with geospatial features, and then we analyze the performances of two of them, selecting the ones based on the Database-as-a-service (DBaaS) model: Azure SQL Database and Azure DocumentDB (i.e., an SQL database versus a NoSQL one). The empirical evaluation shows pros and cons of both solutions and it is performed on a real use case related to an emergency management application.", "venue": "2017 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2017-12-01", "journal": {"name": "2017 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "pages": "3388-3397"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2292282200", "name": "Elena Baralis"}, {"authorId": "2292140223", "name": "Andrea Dalla Valle"}, {"authorId": "1712027", "name": "P.
