In this paper, we employ a single heterogeneous machine with fast storage media (e.g., NVMe SSD) and massively parallel coprocessors (e.g., Xeon Phi) to reach similar dimensions. By fully exploiting the heterogeneous devices, we design a new graph processing engine, named Mosaic, for a single machine. We propose a new locality-optimizing, space-efficient graph representation---Hilbert-ordered tiles, and a hybrid execution model that enables vertex-centric operations in fast host processors and edge-centric operations in massively parallel coprocessors. Our evaluation shows that for smaller graphs, Mosaic consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art out-of-core engines by 3.2-58.6x and shows comparable performance to distributed graph engines. Furthermore, Mosaic can complete one iteration of the Pagerank algorithm on a trillion-edge graph in 21 minutes, outperforming a distributed disk-based engine by 9.2\u00d7.", "venue": "European Conference on Computer Systems", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2017-04-23", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the Twelfth European Conference on Computer Systems"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3427189", "name": "Steffen Maass"}, {"authorId": "7761504", "name": "Changwoo Min"}, {"authorId": "1909974", "name": "Sanidhya Kashyap"}, {"authorId": "2654775", "name": "Woon-Hak Kang"}, {"authorId": "2109783996", "name": "Mohan Kumar"}, {"authorId": "3254849", "name": "Taesoo Kim"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "93ee7e994d8c9dfa57891bef015ce97a38881b04", "title": "GraphZeppelin\n : How to Find Connected Components (Even When Graphs Are Dense, Dynamic, and Massive)"}, {"paperId": "5b6284d3aa3b700ab94ca9686bab8f9528942984", "title": "How to create graphs in hardware-constrained environments?
