Currently, a number of cities have conducted studies on smart cities, but they have mostly focused on analyzing the conceptual connotations or applications in specific domains and lack a shareable and integrated framework, which has led to significant barriers for individual smart projects. By analyzing the framework and applications of Smart City, this paper proposes a common, shareable and integrated conceptual framework. Then, based on this framework, it further proposes a unified portal platform that can balance multiple stakeholders, including the government, citizens and businesses, as well as for common, custom and other application modes. Finally, the implementation of Smart Weifang based on this platform is discussed. The applications indicate that this shareable platform can effectively eliminate the data and technological barriers between different smart city systems while also avoiding redundant financial investments. The investigation of this proposed framework and platform is highly significant for the unified construction of smart cities and the intensification of the hardware environment, thus representing a true achievement in the transition from \u2018information islands\u2019 to \u2018information sharing and interconnection\u2019 for urban informatization.", "venue": "Sustainability", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Economics"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2019-08-12", "journal": {"name": "Sustainability"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2128670244", "name": "Chengming Li"}, {"authorId": "46522476", "name": "Xiaoli Liu"}, {"authorId": "48811052", "name": "Z.
