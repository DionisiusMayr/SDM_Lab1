Based on the analysis results and prior probability statistics (probability distributions or sampling distributions), an innovative robust estimation algorithm is proposed for nonlinear systems with uncertain system parameters. Three examples verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.", "venue": "International Journal of Robust and Nonlinear Control", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2021-08-09", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Robust and Nonlinear Control", "pages": "7957 - 7970", "volume": "31"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2152449512", "name": "Jing Wang"}, {"authorId": "144616487", "name": "Gang Hao"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "f1ecb07b750111fc0ebe38bb6283c7c636c6b86c", "title": "Adaptive and robust fractional gain based interpolatory cubature Kalman filter"}, {"paperId": "582e841dd0229c958590333ad43bff7ac161a64a", "title": "Credible Gaussian sum cubature Kalman filter based on non-Gaussian characteristic analysis"}, {"paperId": "c9e655fd6c9894164da9842d380ba4cfd2a9349d", "title": "Robust fractional order singular Kalman filter"}]}
