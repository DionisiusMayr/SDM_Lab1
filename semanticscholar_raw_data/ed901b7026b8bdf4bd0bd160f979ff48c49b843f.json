However, they are exposed to the risk of cryptographic keys being stolen by side-channel attacks. In this study, we conduct simulation experiments of power analysis attacks on AES circuits and clarify the correlation between the sampling interval and the amount of leakage of side-channel information. T-test is used to evaluate the amount of leakage, which is based on four metrics. Experimental results show that the detailed sampling interval is more strongly correlated with the amount of side-channel leakage than the clock period of the circuit.", "venue": "2023 Eleventh International Symposium on Computing and Networking Workshops (CANDARW)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-11-27", "journal": {"name": "2023 Eleventh International Symposium on Computing and Networking Workshops (CANDARW)", "pages": "364-365"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2211126870", "name": "Yuto Miura"}, {"authorId": "1944817137", "name": "Hiroki Nishikawa"}, {"authorId": "49623991", "name": "Xiangbo Kong"}, {"authorId": "2059442942", "name": "Hiroyuki Tomiyama"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "e40178ca5e132bb40048cddbae97658b630771a3", "title": "Impacts of Clock Frequency and Sampling Intervals on Power Side-Channel Leakage of AES Circuits"}]}
