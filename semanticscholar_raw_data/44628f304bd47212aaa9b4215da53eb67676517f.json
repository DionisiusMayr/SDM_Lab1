However, most recent algorithms in BC computation suffer from the problem of high auxiliary memory consumption. To reduce BC computing\u2019s memory consumption, we propose a path-mergingbased algorithm called Galliot to calculate the BC values on GPU, which aims to minimize the on-board memory consumption and enable the BC computation of large-scale graphs. The proposed algorithm requires $\\mathcal{O}$(n) space and runs in $\\mathcal{O}$(mn) time on unweighted graphs. We present the theoretical principle for the proposed path merging method. Moreover, we propose a locality-oriented policy to maintain and update the worklist to improve GPU data locality. In addition, we conducted extensive experiments on NVIDIA GPUs to show the performance of Galliot. The results show that Galliot can process the larger graphs, which have 11.32\u00d7 more vertices and 5.67\u00d7 more edges than the graphs that recent works. Moreover, Galliot can achieve up to 38.77\u00d7 speedup over the existing methods.", "venue": "IEEE Conference on Computer Communications", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-05-17", "journal": {"name": "IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications", "pages": "1-10"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2115546236", "name": "Zhigao Zheng"}, {"authorId": "145756130", "name": "Chen Zhao"}, {"authorId": "2217495380", "name": "Peicheng Xie"}, {"authorId": "2236508431", "name": "Bo DuM"}], "citations": []}
