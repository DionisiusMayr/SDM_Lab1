The integration of data from diverse sources and the utilization of advanced analytical techniques has the potential to revolutionize healthcare by improving diagnostic accuracy, enabling personalized medicine, and enhancing patient outcomes. In this paper, we aim to provide a comprehensive literature review on the application of big data analytics in healthcare, focusing on its ecosystem, applications, and data sources. To achieve this, an extensive analysis of scientific studies published between 2013 and 2023 was conducted and overall 180 scientific studies were thoroughly evaluated, establishing a strong foundation for future research and identifying collaboration opportunities in the healthcare domain. The study delves into various application areas of BDA in healthcare, highlights successful implementations, and explores their potential to enhance healthcare outcomes while reducing costs. Additionally, it outlines the challenges and limitations associated with BDA in healthcare, discusses modelling tools and techniques, showcases deployed solutions, and presents the advantages of BDA through various real-world use cases. Furthermore, this study identifies and discusses key open research challenges in the field of big data analytics in healthcare, aiming to push the boundaries and contribute to enhanced healthcare outcomes and decision-making processes.", "venue": "IEEE Access", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "IEEE Access", "pages": "112891-112928", "volume": "11"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2258555429", "name": "Awais Ahmed"}, {"authorId": "145086660", "name": "Rui Xi"}, {"authorId": "3355022", "name": "Mengshu Hou"}, {"authorId": "71341163", "name": "Syed Attique Shah"}, {"authorId": "49056545", "name": "S.
