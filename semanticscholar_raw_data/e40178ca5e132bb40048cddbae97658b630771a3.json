However, they are in danger of having their cryptographic keys stolen by side-channel attacks. In order to provide scalable security countermeasures against the increasing diversity of attacks, we investigate the basic characteristics of side-channel attacks. In this study, we perform a simulation-based demonstration of power side-channel attack on AES circuit to investigate the impact of two timing factors, clock frequency and sampling intervals, on side-channel attack resistance.", "venue": "International Conference on Electronics, Information and Communications", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2024-01-28", "journal": {"name": "2024 International Conference on Electronics, Information, and Communication (ICEIC)", "pages": "1-2"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2211126870", "name": "Yuto Miura"}, {"authorId": "1944817137", "name": "Hiroki Nishikawa"}, {"authorId": "49623991", "name": "Xiangbo Kong"}, {"authorId": "2059442942", "name": "Hiroyuki Tomiyama"}], "citations": []}
