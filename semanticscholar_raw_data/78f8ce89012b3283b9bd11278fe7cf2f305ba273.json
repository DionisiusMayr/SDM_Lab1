To ensure that plans are accurate, one needs to know what actually happened in the disaster-affected area and for this purpose thoroughly and quickly the entire area need to be studied. To address this issue, we use UAV or drone navigation autonomously in required trajectories. By using UAVs you can cover surveillance across the vast acres of land quickly and know what happened and plan rescue operations accordingly. In this paper, we presented our work on moving the drones in multiple trajectories and swarm, thus amplifying surveillance capabilities. Each trajectory is maneuvered autonomously and a corresponding trajectory-algorithm running at the back end is presented along with the simulation results.", "venue": "2024 IEEE International Students' Conference on Electrical, Electronics and Computer Science (SCEECS)", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2024-02-24", "journal": {"name": "2024 IEEE International Students' Conference on Electrical, Electronics and Computer Science (SCEECS)", "pages": "1-6"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2294756412", "name": "Gojja Sree Mourya"}, {"authorId": "2294755255", "name": "Abhinav Jami"}, {"authorId": "2064718999", "name": "Abhinav Ajith"}, {"authorId": "2294760425", "name": "Ayan Habib Seikh"}, {"authorId": "2160734843", "name": "J.
