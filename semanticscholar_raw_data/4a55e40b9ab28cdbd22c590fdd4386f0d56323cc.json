MapReduce is a programming paradigm for large-scale distributed information processing. This paper proposes a MapReduce algorithm for the minimum vertex cover problem, which is known to be NP-hard. The MapReduce algorithm can e\ufb03ciently obtain a minimal vertex cover in a small number of rounds. We show the e\ufb00ectiveness of the algorithm through experimental evaluation and comparison with exact and approximate algorithms which demonstrates a high quality in a small number of MapReduce rounds. We also con\ufb01rm from experimentation that the algorithm has good scalability allowing high-quality solutions under restricted computation times due to increased graph size. Moreover, we extend our algorithm to randomized one to obtain a good expected approximate ratio.", "venue": "Computing and informatics", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "Comput.
