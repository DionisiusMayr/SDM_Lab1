It can be treated successfully through a simple and accurate diagnosis. Getting the right diagnosis at the right time is very important for the treatment of heart failure. Currently, the conventional method of diagnosing heart disease is not reliable. Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that can be used to analyze the data collected by sensors. Data mining is another type of technology that can be utilized in the healthcare industry. These techniques help predict heart disease based on various factors. We developed a prediction and recommendation model aimed at predicting heart disease using the Optimized Deep Belief Network. It does so by taking into account the various features of the heart disease UCI and Stalog database. Finally, the proposed method classifies healthy people and people with heart illness with an accuracy of 97.91% .", "venue": "Journal of Intelligent & Fuzzy Systems", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-09-04", "journal": {"name": "J.
