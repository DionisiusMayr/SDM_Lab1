This monograph focuses on the Massively Parallel Model of Computation (MPC) framework, also known as the MapReduce model in the literature. It describes algorithmic tools that have been developed to leverage the unique features of the MPC framework. These tools were chosen for their broad applicability, as they can serve as building blocks to design new algorithms. The monograph is not exhaustive and includes topics such as partitioning and coresets, sample and prune, dynamic programming, round compression, and lower bounds.
