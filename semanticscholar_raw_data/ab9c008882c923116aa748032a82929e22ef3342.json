Rather, they are often \u201cwicked problems\u201d: \u201cnexus of complexity, uncertainty and values divergence\u201d [1]. The Urban Mobility System is an organized complex adaptive system comprised of many intelligent network-aware agents as well as vectors of constraints. It can be subject to goals and aspirations in urban mobility plans. There is a decision problem, a data problem, and a design problem. The approach is to create an informatics construct: a transdisciplinary frame of agent-based micro-simulation, multi-objective optimization, and data mining. Seeking to both study and ameliorate the system at the same time, we outline an empirical research agenda and discuss merits and possible drawbacks.", "venue": "2022 IEEE European Technology and Engineering Management Summit (E-TEMS)", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-03-09", "journal": {"name": "2022 IEEE European Technology and Engineering Management Summit (E-TEMS)", "pages": "72-77"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "50814892", "name": "Tristan Stull"}, {"authorId": "2077768", "name": "Jean-Pierre Kuilboer"}], "citations": []}
