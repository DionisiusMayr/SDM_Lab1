However, EI faces various challenges due to resource constraints, heterogeneous network environments, and diverse service requirements of different applications, which together affect the trustworthiness of EI in the eyes of stakeholders. This survey comprehensively summarizes the characteristics, architecture, technologies, and solutions of trustworthy EI. Specifically, we first emphasize the need for trustworthy EI in the context of the trend toward large models. We then provide an initial definition of trustworthy EI, explore its key characteristics and give a multi-layered architecture for trustworthy EI. Then, we summarize several important issues that hinder the achievement of trustworthy EI. Subsequently, we present enabling technologies for trustworthy EI systems and provide an in-depth literature review of the state-of-the-art solutions for realizing the trustworthiness of EI. Finally, we discuss the corresponding research challenges and open issues.", "venue": "", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-10-27", "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2262290665", "name": "Xiaojie Wang"}, {"authorId": "2262407867", "name": "Beibei Wang"}, {"authorId": "2262414436", "name": "Yu Wu"}, {"authorId": "34506974", "name": "Zhaolong Ning"}, {"authorId": "2262394856", "name": "Song Guo"}, {"authorId": "2262427411", "name": "Fei Richard Yu"}], "citations": []}
