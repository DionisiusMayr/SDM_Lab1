The process is user-friendly and easy to manage, and its model is standardized, quantified, iterable, easy to modify, flexible, and configurable. The mechanism and model of the refined management of college students' learning process are of great significance to the improvement of teaching policies and the continuous improvement of the quality of personnel training, and penetrate the whole learning cycle.", "venue": "Proceedings of the 2019 8th International Conference on Educational and Information Technology", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2019-03-02", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 2019 8th International Conference on Educational and Information Technology"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2056422673", "name": "Jun Mou"}, {"authorId": "3178040", "name": "Huazhu Song"}, {"authorId": "2152752582", "name": "Jun Li"}, {"authorId": "123875735", "name": "Kaituo Mi"}], "citations": []}
