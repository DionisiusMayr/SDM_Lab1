It is very effective to design and develop awareness-raising tools suitable for children\u2019s learning needs in this process. The main purpose of this study is to contribute to raising awareness of disasters among children in Turkey. With the study, risk maps for forest fire, landslide, flood, earthquake, and avalanche in Turkey were designed, and materials were developed by equipping them with disaster-themed texts. A questionnaire was applied to 165 students in the 10\u201311 age group with these interesting and entertaining materials. The results indicate that the study increased students\u2019 ability to learn about disasters with maps by an average of 39%.", "venue": "Open Geosciences", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-01-01", "journal": {"name": "Open Geosciences", "pages": "675 - 690", "volume": "14"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "93639225", "name": "Ilkay Bugdayci"}, {"authorId": "2174374959", "name": "Emre Cetinkaya"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "3a6f0e2365af0fd6e91f986835e12a65b52dcedd", "title": "Strengthening East Java Contextual Disaster Literacy in Social Science Learning"}, {"paperId": "0f59b1ef5211d5025135877f489f81b75bcf4cc1", "title": "Relational epistemologies for sustainability and resilience towards disasters"}]}
