It is necessary to have an in depth analysis of the security features of the 5G network before its wide deployment. So, we intend to model a testbed that will be able to probe into security strengths and weakness of the open 5G architecture. In this paper, we have laid down the design of our experimental 5G testbed that encompasses a blend of 5G components spanning over Software Defined Networks, Fog computing and Internet of Things. Our testbed comprises of next generation programmable switches that is capable of effectively demonstrating 5G security services and experimenting on real time data of the programmable openflow enabled switches.", "venue": "5G World Forum", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2018-07-01", "journal": {"name": "2018 IEEE 5G World Forum (5GWF)", "pages": "204-209"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "51244881", "name": "N.
