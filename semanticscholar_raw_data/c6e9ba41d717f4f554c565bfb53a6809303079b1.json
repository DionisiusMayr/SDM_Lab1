From an architectural point of view, our approach allows to link different storage systems (polystore) and limits the impact of ETL tools performing model transformations required to feed different analysis algorithms. Therefore, systems can take advantage of multiple data models both in terms of query execution performance and the semantic expressiveness of data representation. The proposed model allows to reach the logical independence between data and programs implementing analysis algorithms. With a concrete case study on message virality on Twitter during the French presidential election of 2017, we highlight some of the contributions of our model.", "venue": "International Database Engineering and Applications Symposium", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book"], "publicationDate": "2018-06-18", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 22nd International Database Engineering & Applications Symposium"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "47792304", "name": "\u00c9.
