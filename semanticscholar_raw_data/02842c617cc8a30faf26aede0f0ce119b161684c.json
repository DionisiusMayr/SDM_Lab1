Recent zero-copy APIs expose NIC scatter-gather capabilities, raising the possibility of offloading this data movement to the NIC. However, as the memory coordination required for scatter-gather adds bookkeeping overhead, scatter-gather is not always useful. We describe Cornflakes, a hybrid serialization library stack that uses scatter-gather for serialization when it improves performance and falls back to memory copies otherwise. We have implemented Cornflakes within a UDP and TCP networking stack, across Mellanox and Intel NICs. On a Twitter cache trace, Cornflakes achieves 15.4% higher throughput than prior software approaches on a custom key-value store and 8.8% higher throughput than Redis serialization within Redis.", "venue": "Symposium on Operating Systems Principles", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-10-23", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 29th Symposium on Operating Systems Principles"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "40216803", "name": "Deepti Raghavan"}, {"authorId": "2240360923", "name": "Shreya Ravi"}, {"authorId": "2240348446", "name": "Gina Yuan"}, {"authorId": "15810130", "name": "Pratiksha Thaker"}, {"authorId": "2240476951", "name": "Sanjari Srivastava"}, {"authorId": "2240475402", "name": "Micah Murray"}, {"authorId": "2194974", "name": "Pedro Henrique Penna"}, {"authorId": "1961095", "name": "Amy Ousterhout"}, {"authorId": "2266474683", "name": "Philip Levis"}, {"authorId": "2253469020", "name": "Matei Zaharia"}, {"authorId": "2240372916", "name": "Irene Zhang"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "17bb53118fa363256d03d60f874f321bfe069d6b", "title": "The I/O Driven Server: From SmartNICs to Data Movement Controllers"}]}
