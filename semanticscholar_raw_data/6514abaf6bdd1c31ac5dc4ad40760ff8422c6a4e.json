The conventional manual BT generation method is inefficient and heavily reliant on domain expertise. On the other hand, existing automatic BT generation technologies encounter bottlenecks related to task complexity, model adaptability, and reliability. In order to overcome these challenges, we propose a novel methodology that leverages the robust representation and reasoning abilities of LLMs. The core contribution of this paper lies in the design of a BT generation framework based on LLM, which encompasses the entire process, from data synthesis and model training to application developing and data verification. Synthetic data is introduced to train the BT generation model (BTGen model), enhancing its understanding and adaptability to various complex tasks, thereby significantly improving its overall performance. In order to ensure the effectiveness and executability of the generated BTs, we emphasize the importance of data verification and introduce a multilevel verification strategy. Additionally, we explore a range of agent design and development schemes with LLM as the central element. We hope that the work in this paper may provide a reference for the researchers who are interested in BT generation based on LLMs.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-01-16", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2401.08089"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2268097533", "name": "Fu Li"}, {"authorId": "2275752398", "name": "Xueying Wang"}, {"authorId": "2279768718", "name": "Bin Li"}, {"authorId": "2201666820", "name": "Yunlong Wu"}, {"authorId": "2163305789", "name": "Yanzhen Wang"}, {"authorId": "2279554946", "name": "Xiaodong Yi"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "361319cf7d148b0a355b76270f528ff5effd6d00", "title": "Beyond BERT: Exploring the Efficacy of RoBERTa and ALBERT in Supervised Multiclass Text Classification"}]}
