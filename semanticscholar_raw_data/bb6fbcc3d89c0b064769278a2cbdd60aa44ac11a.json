We also show how generating controlled synthetic data using this workflow fixes some of the notable weaknesses of LLM-based generation and increases the performance of classical machine learning models on the code comment classification task. Our best model, a Neural Network, achieves a Macro-F1 score of 91.412% with an increase of 1.033% after data augmentation.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-02-25", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2402.16910"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1514280691", "name": "Hanna Abi Akl"}], "citations": []}
