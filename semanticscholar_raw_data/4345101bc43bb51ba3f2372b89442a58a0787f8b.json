To this end, we collected and analyzed various empirical evidence for data triangulation. The results reflect that retro-inspection distinguishes itself from peer code review by identifying more complicated and underlying defects, providing more indicative and suggestive comments. Many experienced inspectors indicate defects together with their rationale behind and offer suggestions for correction and prevention. As a result, retro-inspection can benefit not only quality assurance (like Fagan inspection), but also internal audit, interdivision communication, and competence promotion. On the other side, we identify several lessons of retro-inspection at this stage, e.g., developers\u2019 acceptance and organizers\u2019 predicament, for next-step improvement of this practice. To be specific, some recommendations are discussed for retro-inspection, e.g., more adequate preparation and more careful publicity. This study concludes that most of the expected benefits of retro-inspection can be empirically confirmed in this enterprise and its value on the progress to continuous maturity can be recognized organization-wide. The experiences on executing this altered practice in a large enterprise provide reference value on code quality assurance to other software organizations.", "venue": "2022 IEEE/ACM 44th International Conference on Software Engineering: Software Engineering in Practice (ICSE-SEIP)", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book", "Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-04-21", "journal": {"name": "2022 IEEE/ACM 44th International Conference on Software Engineering: Software Engineering in Practice (ICSE-SEIP)", "pages": "43-52"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1677573258", "name": "Lanxin Yang"}, {"authorId": "48212955", "name": "He Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2118588785", "name": "Fu-chang Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2108453013", "name": "Xiaodong Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2313200", "name": "Guoping Rong"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "b13d4d943bf997d33fcc340f7a943e16ff563d1f", "title": "EvaCRC: Evaluating Code Review Comments"}, {"paperId": "dfabc03892a12efedabae68725d7cdc63bca6e7f", "title": "Analysis of Comments Given in Documents Inspection in Software Development PBL and Investigation of the Impact on Students"}, {"paperId": "634cf9e61cd8d88b05e1ea70edc48b19d510cd88", "title": "Evaluating Learning-to-Rank Models for Prioritizing Code Review Requests using Process Simulation"}]}
