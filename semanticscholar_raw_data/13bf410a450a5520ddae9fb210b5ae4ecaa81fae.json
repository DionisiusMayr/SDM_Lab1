In this context, learning management system (LMS) as a platform allows recording the learner's activity recorded in order to explore data unique types coming from the academic context in order to improve the learning experience. Therefore, this research aims to reveal the impact of using data analytics technique in LMS to develop the fashion design skills and technology acceptance. The research was applied to students at Home Economics Department who were randomly divided into two equal experimental groups. An extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and a developed product evaluation card were utilized as main research instruments. The empirical findings showed that data analytics technique in LMS had significant and positive influence on the enhancement of students' fashion design skills in the functional, esthetic and creative aspects. Findings also revealed robust supporting evidence for the suggested research model as data analytics technique had a major positive direct impact on the perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of LMS. In addition, it had positive indirect impact on students' attitude and their behavioral intention to use LMS, that mediated by perceived usefulness of LMS.", "venue": "Interactive Learning Environments", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-06-24", "journal": {"name": "Interactive Learning Environments", "pages": "3810 - 3827", "volume": "31"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "30774329", "name": "Abdellah Ibrahim Mohammed Elfeky"}, {"authorId": "74489525", "name": "Marwa Yasien Helmy Elbyaly"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "73350fc5f47c999913fb3b2823cfdbed97dc85c4", "title": "The impact of advance organizers in virtual classrooms on the development of integrated science process skills"}, {"paperId": "402f055ce5816cccec05ed8fa0475d9234c8427a", "title": "Exploring technology acceptance patterns of users of the mixed-reality sport technology Zwift: antecedents and consequences of technology acceptance"}, {"paperId": "c68485624fba2a4eab274857822c6abede7c0749", "title": "The adoption and use of learning analytics tools to improve decision making in higher learning institutions: An extension of technology acceptance model"}, {"paperId": "1a6d544b2c9a5b11c1e6213f793f71a37a28434c", "title": "Are creative users more apt in reusing and adopting Open Government Data (OGD)?
