Our digital metal part classifies the status with real time data processing with convolutional neural network (CNN). The training data for the CNN is collected from a strain gauge embedded in metal parts by laser powder bed fusion process. We implement this approach using additive manufacturing, demonstrate a self-cognitive metal part recognizing partial screw loosening, malfunctioning, and external impacting object. The results indicate that metal part can recognize subtle change of multiple fixation state under repetitive compression with 89.1% accuracy with test sets. The proposed strategy showed promising potential in contributing to the hyper-connectivity for next generation of digital metal based mechanical systems", "venue": "", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-01-18", "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2130397934", "name": "E.
