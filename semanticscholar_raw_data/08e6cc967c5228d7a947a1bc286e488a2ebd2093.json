Hence it is critical that we develop unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms that both operate on a data stream and adapt to it. Real-world maritime data streams involve multiple, intersecting forms of concept drift, meaning that the underlying data distribution changes over time. We introduce DB-Drift, a novel algorithm for adapting existing density-based unsupervised anomaly detection pipelines to handle gradual and seasonal drift simultaneously.", "venue": "2023 Sensor Signal Processing for Defence Conference (SSPD)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-09-01", "journal": {"name": "2023 Sensor Signal Processing for Defence Conference (SSPD)", "pages": "1-5"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2244006794", "name": "Amelia Henriksen"}], "citations": []}
