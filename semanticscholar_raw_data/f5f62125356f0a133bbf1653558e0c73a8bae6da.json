Due to the open access and unreliable wireless channels, some appropriate security measures should be implemented in the VEC to ensure information security. However, the operation of the security mechanism dominates supererogatory computing resources, thus affecting the performance of VEC systems. The scarcity of computation and energy resources of the vehicles conflicts with the requirement of tasks for time delay and information security. In this paper, taking the driving velocity and position of the vehicles, the number of lanes, the model and density of the attackers, and security strength into consideration, we formulate a max-min optimization problem to jointly optimize offloading decision, transmit power, task computation frequency, encryption computation frequency, edge computation frequency, and block length to obtain optimal secure information capacity and local computation delay. The formulated optimization problem is a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP), which is intractable. We apply the generalized benders decomposition (GBD)-based method to solve it. The simulation results show that our proposed algorithms have convergence and effectiveness and achieve fairness among vehicles on the road.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-12-01", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications", "pages": "8751-8765", "volume": "22"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1778012321", "name": "Huizi Xiao"}, {"authorId": "2145805675", "name": "Jun Zhao"}, {"authorId": "2109020134", "name": "Jie Feng"}, {"authorId": "82107592", "name": "Lei Liu"}, {"authorId": "39718931", "name": "Qingqi Pei"}, {"authorId": "2154040016", "name": "Weisong Shi"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "321a684022e30b3a0d044d1a2c05214100689a6e", "title": "Offloading and Quality Control for AI Generated Content Services in 6G Mobile Edge Computing Networks"}, {"paperId": "3627bbee40a65354598159d0f7bf210600e8b628", "title": "Offloading and Quality Control for AI Generated Content Services in Edge Computing Networks"}]}
