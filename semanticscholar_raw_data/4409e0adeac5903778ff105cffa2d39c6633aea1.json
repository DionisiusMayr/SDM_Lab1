Therefore, specific attention should be paid to IoT, especially from two aspects, namely, security and forensics. Security properties, especially authentication, ensure the integrity of large amounts of data processed in IoT networks, while forensic investigations can identify, collect, and retain evidence when abuse in IoT systems occurs. Regarding these two critical aspects, this article introduces and analyzes the latest biometric-based authentication research effort in IoT, as well as some IoT forensic investigation models/frameworks. In addition, we also investigate some unresolved challenges that IoT research still faces and provide a direction for future work.", "venue": "2020 Workshop on Emerging Technologies for Security in IoT (ETSecIoT)", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2020-04-01", "journal": {"name": "2020 Workshop on Emerging Technologies for Security in IoT (ETSecIoT)", "pages": "12-17"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "34800223", "name": "Wencheng Yang"}, {"authorId": "2840505", "name": "Michael N.
