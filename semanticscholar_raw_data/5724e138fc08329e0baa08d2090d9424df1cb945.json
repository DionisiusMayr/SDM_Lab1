Incorrect implementations of DBMSs can result in logic bugs, which cause SELECT queries to fetch incorrect results, or UPDATE and DELETE queries to generate incorrect database states. Existing approaches mainly focus on detecting logic bugs in SELECT queries. However, logic bugs in UPDATE and DELETE queries have not been tackled. In this paper, we propose a novel and general approach, which we have termed Differential Query Execution (DQE), to detect logic bugs in SELECT, UPDATE and DELETE queries of DBMSs. The core idea of DQE is that different SQL queries with the same predicate usually access the same rows in a database. For example, a row updated by an UPDATE query with a predicate \u03c6 should also be fetched by a SELECT query with the same predicate \u03c6, If not, a logic bug is revealed in the target DBMS. To evaluate the effectiveness and generality of DQE, we apply DQE on five production-level DBMSs, i.e., MySQL, MariaDB, TiDB, CockroachDB and SQLite. In total, we have detected 50 unique bugs in these DBMSs, 41 of which have been confirmed, and 11 have been fixed. We expect that the simplicity and generality of DQE can greatly improve the reliability of DBMSs.", "venue": "International Conference on Software Engineering", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-05-01", "journal": {"name": "2023 IEEE/ACM 45th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE)", "pages": "2072-2084"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2199664336", "name": "Jiansen Song"}, {"authorId": "2964640", "name": "Wensheng Dou"}, {"authorId": "2199322459", "name": "Ziyu Cui"}, {"authorId": "2170302199", "name": "Qianwang Dai"}, {"authorId": "40231586", "name": "Wei Wang"}, {"authorId": "144525882", "name": "Jun Wei"}, {"authorId": "145901388", "name": "Hua Zhong"}, {"authorId": "145281930", "name": "Tao Huang"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "5ff9885778f8ec824beaeb6802af5c82e299f702", "title": "A Comprehensive Survey on Database Management System Fuzzing: Techniques, Taxonomy and Experimental Comparison"}, {"paperId": "a9fa1a56ba118fa3b629fc6308d6b5606751f023", "title": "Detecting Isolation Bugs via Transaction Oracle Construction"}, {"paperId": "0b083953239d0617b534a0d76762fa8350db4e6f", "title": "Randomized Differential Testing of RDF Stores"}, {"paperId": "c8376be6e5d269467545de4edffe06bb2b74b1c7", "title": "Understanding Transaction Bugs in Database Systems"}]}
