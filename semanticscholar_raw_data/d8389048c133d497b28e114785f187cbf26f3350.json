Polypus is a modular framework that provides the following functionalities: (1) massive text extraction from Twitter, (2) distributed non-relational storage optimized for time range queries, (3) memory-based intermodule buffering, (4) real-time sentiment classification, (5) near real-time keyword sentiment aggregation in time series, (6) a HTTP API to interact with the Polypus cluster and (7) a web interface to analyze results visually. The whole architecture is self-deployable and based on Docker containers.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2018-01-11", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/1801.03710"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1414612521", "name": "Rodrigo Mart\u00ednez-Casta\u00f1o"}, {"authorId": "3052790", "name": "J.
