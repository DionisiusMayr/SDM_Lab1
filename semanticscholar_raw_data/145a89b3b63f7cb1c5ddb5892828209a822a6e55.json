However, GWR calibration becomes critical when using a serial computing mode to process large volumes of data. To address this problem, an improved approach based on the compute unified device architecture (CUDA) parallel architecture fast-parallel-GWR (FPGWR) is proposed in this paper to efficiently handle the computational demands of performing GWR over millions of data points. FPGWR is capable of decomposing the serial process into parallel atomic modules and optimizing the memory usage. To verify the computing capability of FPGWR, we designed simulation datasets and performed corresponding testing experiments. We also compared the performance of FPGWR and other GWR software packages using open datasets. The results show that the runtime of FPGWR is negatively correlated with the CUDA core number, and the calculation efficiency of FPGWR achieves a rate of thousands or even tens of thousands times faster than the traditional GWR algorithms. FPGWR provides an effective tool for exploring spatial heterogeneity for large-scale geographic data (geodata).", "venue": "ISPRS Int. J.
