Traditional and rigid data integration and processing techniques become inadequate for a new class of data-intensive applications. There is a need for new architectural, software, and hardware solutions that are capable of providing dynamic data integration, assuring high data quality, and offering safety and security mechanisms, while facilitating online data analysis. In this context, we propose\n moduli\n , a novel disaggregated data management reference architecture for data-intensive applications that organizes data processing in various\n zones.\n Working on\n moduli\n allowed us also to identify open research and technological challenges.\n", "venue": "SIGWEB Newsl.", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-01-01", "journal": {"name": "SIGWEB Newsl.", "pages": "4:1-4:16", "volume": "2024"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1734072", "name": "P.
