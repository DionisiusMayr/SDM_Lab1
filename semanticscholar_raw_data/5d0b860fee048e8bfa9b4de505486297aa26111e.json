However, the complexity and dynamic nature of these environments also call for self-adaptation abilities, as guaranteeing efficient resource usage and acceptable service levels through static configurations is very difficult. In this talk, we discuss a hierarchical auto-scaling approach for distributed applications, where application-level managers steer the overall process by supervising component-level adaptation managers. Following a bottom-up approach, we first discuss how to exploit model-free and model-based reinforcement learning to compute auto-scaling policies for each component. Then, we show how Bayesian optimization can be used to automatically configure the lower-level auto-scalers based on application-level objectives. As a case study, we consider distributed data stream processing applications, which process high-volume data flows in near real-time and cope with varying and unpredictable workloads.", "venue": "International Conference on Performance Engineering", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-04-15", "journal": {"name": "Companion of the 2023 ACM/SPEC International Conference on Performance Engineering"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2125194664", "name": "Gabriele Russo Russo"}], "citations": []}
