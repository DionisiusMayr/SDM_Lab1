It is assumed that the system uses big data technologies to process heterogeneous information. Information in various formats is obtained using remote sensing of the earth, aerial photography, shooting from unmanned aerial vehicles, and internal monitoring of the state of objects of the recreational zone. The area of pollution and the volume of emissions and, consequently, the concentrations created by them are determined by experts considering the available data. The necessity of considering the dynamics of the ecological state based on the available data generated by weather services and remote sensing data of the earth in various spectral ranges is shown. Also, within the framework of the monitoring system, statistical data and results of modeling the ecological state of the recreational zone are used. Based on the analytics of big data, it is supposed to build a forecast of thermal emissions and the amount of harmful substances in the atmosphere carried by air masses.", "venue": "International Conference on Data Analytics and Management in Data Intensive Domains", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"pages": "171-181"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2054741860", "name": "A.
