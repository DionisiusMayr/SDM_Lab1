Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Office of Educational Technology has repeatedly emphasized the importance of using evidence to validate claims from VLE-based educational research. Although VLE data can provide some affordances for conducting educational research, we argue that many challenges can arise with respect to providing evidence for construct validity. The objective of this commentary is to encourage educational researchers using operational, at-scale VLE data to align their data and intended constructs to a theoretical framework of construct validity threats in order to develop a comprehensive set of actionable solutions. We use examples from our research project as a demonstration resource for performing such an alignment.", "venue": "Journal of Research on Educational Effectiveness", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2019-10-02", "journal": {"name": "Journal of Research on Educational Effectiveness", "pages": "750 - 759", "volume": "12"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1403600128", "name": "A.
