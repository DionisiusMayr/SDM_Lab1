This study developed the Neuro-Fuzzy-AHP (NFAHP) technique for fusing remote sensing (i.e., ASTER alteration mineral image-maps) and geological datasets (i.e., lithological map, geochronological map, structural map, and geochemical map) to identify high potential zones of volcanic massive sulfide (VMS) copper mineralization in the Sahlabad mining area, east Iran. Argillic, phyllic, propylitic and gossan alteration zones were identified in the study area using band ratio and Selective Principal Components Analysis (SPCA) methods implemented to ASTER VNIR and SWIR bands. For each of the copper deposits, old mines and mineralization indices in the study area, information related to exploration factors such as ore mineralization, host-rock lithology, alterations, geochronological, geochemistry, and distance from high intensity lineament factor communities were investigated. Subsequently, the predictive power of these factors in identifying copper occurrences was evaluated using Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) technique. The BPNN results demonstrated that using the exploration factors, copper mineralizations in Sahlabad mining area could be identified with high accuracy. Lastly, using the Fuzzy-Analytic Hierarchy Process (Fuzzy-AHP) method, information layers were weighted and fused. As a result, a potential map of copper mineralization was generated, which pinpointed several high potential zones in the study area. For verification of the results, the documented copper deposits, old mines, and mineralization indices in the study area were plotted on the potential map, which is particularly appearing in high favorability parts of the potential map. In conclusion, the Neuro-Fuzzy-AHP (NFAHP) technique shows great reliability for copper exploration in the Sahlabad mining area, and it can be extrapolated to other metallogenic provinces in Iran and other regions for the reconnaissance stage of mineral exploration.", "venue": "Remote Sensing", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-11-04", "journal": {"name": "Remote.
