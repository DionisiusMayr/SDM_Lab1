Both of these libraries, do not directly realize the idea of resolving queries based on rough-set-driven calculations on granulated data statistics, what was one of the biggest accelerators in ICE. We summarize the implementation of such level of operations and compare the performance of analytical SQL queries in ROOT, Parquet, and ICE.", "venue": "2020 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2020-12-10", "journal": {"name": "2020 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "pages": "5405-5412"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "14451033", "name": "M.
