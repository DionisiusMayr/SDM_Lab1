We present a general method that solves most locally checkable labeling ( LCL ) problems exponentially faster in the low-space MPC model than in the LOCAL message passing model. In particular, we show that all solvable LCL problems on trees can be solved in O (log n ) time (high-complexity regime) and that all LCL problems on trees with deterministic complexity n o (1) in the LOCAL model can be solved in O (log log n ) time (mid-complexity regime). We observe that obtaining a greater speed-up than from n o (1) to \u0398(log log n ) is conditionally impossible, since the problem of 3-coloring trees, which is a LCL problem with LOCAL time complexity n o (1) , has a conditional MPC lower bound of \u2126(log log n ) [Linial, FOCS\u201987; Gha\ufb00ari, Kuhn and Uitto, FOCS\u201919]. We emphasize that we solve LCL problems on constant -degree trees, and that our algorithms are deterministic, component-stable, and work in the low-space MPC model, where local memory is O ( n \u03b4 ) for \u03b4 \u2208 (0 , 1) and global memory is O ( m ). For the high-complexity regime, there are two key ingredients. One is a novel O (log n )-time tree rooting algorithm, which may be of independent interest. The other is a novel pointer-chain technique and analysis that allows us to solve any solvable LCL problem on trees in O (log n ) time. For the mid-complexity regime, we adapt the approach by Chang and Pettie [FOCS\u201917], who gave a canonical LOCAL algorithm for solving LCL problems on", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2021-12-17", "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "144105939", "name": "S.
