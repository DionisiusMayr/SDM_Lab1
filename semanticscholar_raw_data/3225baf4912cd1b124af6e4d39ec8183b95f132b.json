Open mining pools attract a large number of miners for solving difficult problems together. Although the open strategy is likely to be more efficient, it makes pools susceptible to attack at the same time. In this paper, we present a game-theoretic analysis of mining pool strategy selection in order to explore the trade-off between the efficiency of openness and the vulnerability of attacks in a PoW-based blockchain network. We first model the pool mining process as a two-stage game, wherein the pools might decide whether to open or not and to attack or not. Based on the two-stage game model, we analyze the Nash equilibrium and the evolutionary stability of the mining games among pools, which uncovers the pool selection dynamics of PoW-based blockchain networks. In particular, we find that the attack behavior is the norm for a weak pool and triggers lower expected utilities when punishing the attacks more severely. Numerical simulations also support our theoretical findings as well as demonstrate the stability of the pools\u2019 strategy selection.", "venue": "IEEE Access", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2019-01-02", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Access", "pages": "8427-8436", "volume": "7"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2118462043", "name": "Yue Wang"}, {"authorId": "8355158", "name": "Changbing Tang"}, {"authorId": "3094785", "name": "Feilong Lin"}, {"authorId": "3185576", "name": "Zhonglong Zheng"}, {"authorId": "49865752", "name": "Zhongyu Chen"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "c1fdf2f1097f1728c8cd6024eb9ab263d4d523ad", "title": "Maximizing NFT Incentives: References Make You Rich"}, {"paperId": "0add589c56417962b7ad2f3dc815e2ebe45046d6", "title": "The Validator\u2019s Dilemma in PoW Blockchain: An Evolutionary Game Perspective"}, {"paperId": "20f7179add2e2c7f39db93eb877412199310db17", "title": "Majority is Not Required: A Rational Analysis of the Private Double-Spend Attack from a Sub-Majority Adversary"}, {"paperId": "8c417b3cabe6f90b5a6118ae20fa2ebbde7bfbc7", "title": "How to Rationally Select Your Delegatee in PoS"}, {"paperId": "9fe986e75c77c0ed925dba14b9514f14ba562852", "title": "Security and privacy protection technologies in securing blockchain applications"}, {"paperId": "b9df43b1ede2dc44b7e20d60b55122c5faf4e830", "title": "Smoothening block rewards: How much should miners pay for mining pools?"}, {"paperId": "3833dbf334098719e2c2b8b9cb46567c2428f997", "title": "Unraveling the MEV Enigma: ABI-Free Detection Model using Graph Neural Networks"}, {"paperId": "33b07df2699ed83ab576727d61d447d0a6f62f64", "title": "Models used to characterise blockchain features.
