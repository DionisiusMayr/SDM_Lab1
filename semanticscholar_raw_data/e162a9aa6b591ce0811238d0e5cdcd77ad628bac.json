It emphasizes the need for innovative approaches to decision-making in uncertain situations, considering globalization and technological advancements. Emergency response personnel can harness data from critical infrastructure, smartphones, and social media to gain insights, anticipate affected populations, and formulate comprehensive action plans using big data. Big data analytics provide real-time indicators for on-site disaster statistics, enabling swift feedback loops and precise assessments. The Dynamic Data-Driven Application Systems (DDDAS) framework, exemplified by \u201cI Revive,\u201d is explored for making critical decisions in emergency medical care. This dynamic environment continuously receives and responds to real-time data, facilitating global collaboration for synchronized decision-making.", "venue": "2023 International Conference on Human-Centered Cognitive Systems (HCCS)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-12-16", "journal": {"name": "2023 International Conference on Human-Centered Cognitive Systems (HCCS)", "pages": "1-6"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2288594006", "name": "Zameer Ahmad"}, {"authorId": "2288586828", "name": "Sayed Hammad Hussain"}, {"authorId": "143957804", "name": "Muddesar Iqbal"}, {"authorId": "66356791", "name": "Babur Hayat Malik"}, {"authorId": "35191082", "name": "Moustafa M.
