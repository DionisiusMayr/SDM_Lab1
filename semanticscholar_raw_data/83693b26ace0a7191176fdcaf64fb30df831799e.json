Positive instances of biofilm usage involve their capacity to immobilize pollutants such as heavy metals, while adverse cases result in infections like urinary tract infections. Therefore, the study of biofilm engineering emerges as crucial. Employing a bibliographic research approach, this paper delves into biofilm engineering, identifying key species like Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus, among others. The investigation also unveils major research subjects and corresponding institutions dedicated to biofilm research. A comprehensive understanding of biofilm engineering holds profound implications for advancing knowledge in this domain.", "venue": "Acta Microbiologica Hellenica", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-02-26", "journal": {"name": "Acta Microbiologica Hellenica"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2256142883", "name": "Shan Chen"}, {"authorId": "2111070979", "name": "Yuanzhao Ding"}], "citations": []}
