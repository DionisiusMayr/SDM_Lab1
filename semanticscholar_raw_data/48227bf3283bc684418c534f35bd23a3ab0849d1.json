As a part of the way that DICOM transmits files, the PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication System) platform, Dicoogle, has become one of the most in-demand image processing and viewing platforms. However, the Dicoogle PACS architecture does not guarantee image information recovery in the case of information loss. Therefore, this paper proposes a file recovery solution in the Dicoogle architecture. The proposal consists of maximizing the encoding and decoding performance of medical images through computational parallelism. To validate the proposal, the Java programming language based on the Reed-Solomon algorithm is implemented in different performance tests. The experimental results show that the proposal is optimal in terms of image processing time for the Dicoogle PACS storage system.", "venue": "IEEE Access", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "IEEE Access", "pages": "1-1", "volume": "PP"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2177431453", "name": "Fabricio Marcillo"}, {"authorId": "2084552301", "name": "Antonio F.
