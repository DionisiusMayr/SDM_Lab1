This paper presents a multifaceted approach aimed at harnessing the power of intelligent systems to address the complex and evolving landscape of crime in societies with diminishing Police workforce in Nigeria. The study provides a comprehensive overview of the demographic shifts leading to a declining workforce and their far-reaching implications on crime rates, public safety, and law enforcement resources. It underscores the urgency of adapting to this new reality and the need for intelligent systems to assist in this endeavor. The paper adopts the object-oriented methodology in the design and development of an intelligent system tailored for crime management and insecurity mitigation. Drawing from the fields of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analytics, this system employs cutting-edge techniques for predictive policing, resource allocation optimization, and risk assessment. It integrates data from various sources, including crime statistics, demographic data, economic indicators, and social media sentiment analysis, to provide a holistic understanding of the crime landscape. Furthermore, this paper emphasizes the ethical considerations and safeguards built into the intelligent system to prevent bias, discrimination, and privacy infringements. It discusses the importance of transparency, accountability, and community engagement in the deployment and operation of such systems. The study also highlights real-world case studies and pilot implementations of the intelligent system in select regions facing workforce decline. It showcases how the system has contributed to more efficient law enforcement practices, reduced response times, and enhanced crime prevention strategies. The paper outlines a roadmap for future research, emphasizing the continuous refinement and adaptation of the intelligent system to evolving police workforce dynamics. It underscores the importance of ongoing collaboration between researchers, policymakers, law enforcement agencies, and communities to ensure the system's effectiveness and ethical use.", "venue": "2023 2nd International Conference on Multidisciplinary Engineering and Applied Science (ICMEAS)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-11-01", "journal": {"name": "2023 2nd International Conference on Multidisciplinary Engineering and Applied Science (ICMEAS)", "pages": "1-8"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2288585052", "name": "Wilson Nwankwo"}, {"authorId": "1922396", "name": "Kingsley C.
