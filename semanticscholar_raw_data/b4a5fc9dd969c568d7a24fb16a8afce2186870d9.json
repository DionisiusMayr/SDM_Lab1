In order to solve the large-scale overlapping problems effectively, the paper proposes a novel cooperative co-evolutionary framework for large-scale overlapping problems called the cooperative co-evolution algorithm with subgroup merging and resource allocation for overlapping problems (CCMRO). In CCMRO, a contribution-based subcomponent merging strategy is proposed to deal with the decomposition of the large-scale overlapping problem and reduce the interaction of subgroups. In addition, a new computational resource allocation strategy (CCRO) is designed to maintain a balance between the full allocation of computational resources and the stability of search speed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed CCMRO is verified by the large-scale overlapping benchmark functions.", "venue": "IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-07-01", "journal": {"name": "2023 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)", "pages": "1-8"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2249370821", "name": "Mingke Chen"}, {"authorId": "2282311445", "name": "Wei Du"}], "citations": []}
