These queries are often multi-key look-ups in highly skewed tables and indexes.\n In our production experience, only progressive query-specific partitioning can achieve Napa's strict query latency SLOs. Here we advocate good-enough partitioning that keeps the per-query partitioning time low without risking uneven work distribution. Our design combines pragmatic system choices and algorithmic innovations. For instance, B-trees are augmented with statistics of key distributions, thus serving the dual purpose of aiding lookups and partitioning. Furthermore, progressive partitioning is designed to be \"good enough\" thereby balancing partitioning time with performance. The resulting system is robust and successfully serves day-in-day-out billions of queries with very high quality of service forming a core infrastructure at Google.", "venue": "Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-08-01", "journal": {"name": "Proc.
