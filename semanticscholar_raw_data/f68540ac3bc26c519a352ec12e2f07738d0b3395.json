This paper reviewed various machine learning methods including supervised and unsupervised learning and highlighted their applications, advantages and disadvantages in landslide susceptibility mapping. The review has also mentioned the challenges of machine learning algorithms for achieving higher performance accuracy from the supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms during landslide susceptibility. Moreover, highlights on the application of deep learning methods as the current research in landslide susceptibility mapping has also been reported. Finally, this paper argued the necessity of thorough preparation of relevant and enough data being significant important to obtain high performance results from the review methods.", "venue": "Proceedings of the 1st International Conference on Innovation in Computer and Information Science", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 1st International Conference on Innovation in Computer and Information Science"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2087527428", "name": "D.
