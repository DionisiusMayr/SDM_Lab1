The threat surface grows as businesses engage more in automation, scale their operations, and integrate IoT, and many security teams struggle to stay up.

Organizations must maintain a strong asset management process, be resilient to cyber risks, and generate business value by being ahead of the curve when it comes to managing cyber threats.", "venue": "International Conference Intelligent Computing and Control Systems", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-05-17", "journal": {"name": "2023 7th International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Control Systems (ICICCS)", "pages": "1442-1447"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3332722", "name": "Sweta Mishra"}, {"authorId": "1865763969", "name": "Saikat Gochhait"}], "citations": []}
