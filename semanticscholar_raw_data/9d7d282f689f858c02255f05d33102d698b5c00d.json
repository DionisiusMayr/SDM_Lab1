As the scene unfurls, viewers travel across Walcheren\u2019s dikes, roads, and waterways. Staffage accompanies the viewer on this mental journey, animating the topographical vision. Comparison with Jacob van Deventer\u2019s (c. 1500/5\u20131575) maps of Walcheren\u2019s largest cities (c. 1550) demonstrates van den Wyngaerde\u2019s pictorial style. His style\u2019s potential for cinematic absorption was suited to the panorama\u2019s intended audience and location. A version of this panorama hung in the Palacio de El Pardo of Philip II (1527\u20131598), King of Spain, by September 1564. That painted panorama, now lost, brought before the king\u2019s eyes an illustrated account of the Island\u2019s economic and defensive significance. Strolling the length of the gallery, Philip could envision past time spent on Walcheren and find himself immersed in the Island\u2019s cultural experiences while being reminded of its position. The viewing experience offered the king of Spain a microcosmic synecdoche of his imperial power.", "venue": "Dutch Crossing", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-03-02", "journal": {"name": "Dutch Crossing", "pages": "79 - 107", "volume": "47"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "119955455", "name": "R.
