Initially, there were a lot of different file systems within different servers and machines. Various file operations are allowed only between the files present in the same operating systems. When we have files in different operating systems these operations cannot be performed as the file system does not allow it. The virtual file system becomes an abstract overlay over a more tangible file system, which allows heterogeneous file transfer among different Operating Systems. Although the features offered by both the File Systems are similar, the Virtual File System provides us with an environment, wherein the Files can be accessed by any Operating System type and File System type. This paper focuses on comparing the time it takes to complete the different file operations like creating, reading, writing, deleting a file, etc. using the VFS and a traditional FS. We believe this study would help in better understanding the benefits of using a VFS.", "venue": "2022 2nd International Conference on Technological Advancements in Computational Sciences (ICTACS)", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-10-10", "journal": {"name": "2022 2nd International Conference on Technological Advancements in Computational Sciences (ICTACS)", "pages": "555-558"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2066746485", "name": "Saloni Parekh"}, {"authorId": "151350293", "name": "A.
