Nowadays, the educational data is evolving and has become large in volume, wide in variety and high in velocity. This produced data needs to be handled in an efficient manner to extract value and make informed decisions. For that, the proposed system confronts such data as a big data challenge and presents a comprehensive platform tailored to perform educational big data analytical applications. It presents an effective environment for non-data scientists and people in the educational sector to apply their demanding educational big data applications.", "venue": "International Journal of Engineering Technology and Management Sciences", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "international journal of engineering technology and management sciences"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2242290645", "name": "Najna Nazir"}, {"authorId": "2242284269", "name": "Ambili Antharjanam"}, {"authorId": "2242316297", "name": "Ulliyeri Kozhikode"}], "citations": []}
