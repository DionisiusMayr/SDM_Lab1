With the rapid growth in sensor and communication technologies, the concept of \u201csmart tunnel\u201d has been envisioned where by leveraging sensory data, smooth and safe \ufb02ow of traf\ufb01c is ensured. A prominent signature of such tunnel is coordination among the road elements in the context of C-ITS, facilitated by communication technologies. Road tunnels represent challenging environments for communication due to their unique properties. However, there is a growing demand for ultra-reliable communication within the tunnels, particularly to introduce novel C-ITS safety services. The traditional methods that are aimed at supporting public radio broadcasting and push-to-talk services do not satisfy such demands. In this paper, we study the state-of-the-art of communication technologies for safety services within the road tunnels and identify their challenges, operational requirements and suitability for safety use-cases. Further we focus on disruptive technologies such as 5G cellular networks and the new opportunities that arise from their deployment within the tunnels. Finally we propose a generic 5G-based communication architecture that leverages the use of VEC and URLLC to meet the ever-increasing demands. We highlight that such architecture allows for radically shortening the design and deployment cycle of novel safety services within the tunnels from several years to weeks.", "venue": "Proceedings of the 30th European Safety and Reliability Conference and 15th Probabilistic Safety Assessment and Management Conference", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 30th European Safety and Reliability Conference and 15th Probabilistic Safety Assessment and Management Conference"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2359143", "name": "Naeem Khademi"}, {"authorId": "144990053", "name": "Morten Sommer"}], "citations": []}
