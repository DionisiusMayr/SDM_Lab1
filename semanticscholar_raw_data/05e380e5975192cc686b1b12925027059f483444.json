However, conventional point-based co-location pattern discovery methods ignore spatial movements between locations and thus may generate erroneous findings when applied to spatial flows. Despite recent advances, there is still a lack of methods for analyzing multivariate flows. To bridge the gap, this paper formulates a novel problem of FCLP discovery and presents an effective detection method based on frequent-pattern mining and spatial statistics. We first define a flow co-location index to quantify the co-location frequency of different features in flow neighborhoods, and then employ a bottom-up method to discover all frequent FCLPs. To further establish the statistical significance of the results, we develop a flow pattern reconstruction method to model the benchmark null hypothesis of independence conditioning on univariate flow characteristics (e.g. flow autocorrelation). Synthetic experiments with predefined FCLPs verify the advantages of our method in terms of correctness over available alternatives. A case study using individual home-work commuting flow data in the Chicago Metropolitan Area demonstrates that residence- or workplace-based co-location patterns tend to overestimate the co-location frequency of people with different occupations and could lead to inconsistent results.", "venue": "International Journal of Geographical Information Science", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-09-20", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Geographical Information Science", "pages": "720 - 748", "volume": "36"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "15996861", "name": "Jiannan Cai"}, {"authorId": "1817124213", "name": "Mei\u2010Po Kwan"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "abb18746968f57936c65ea99487c05ad8f508acf", "title": "Mining co-location patterns of manufacturing firms using Q statistic and additive color mixing"}, {"paperId": "132c488b38c8a11e895cdf0333f777c06635eab8", "title": "Mining significant local spatial association rules for multi-category point data"}, {"paperId": "53752df9fdb378ad999f4cff111889dfc3ba1adb", "title": "Modelling and application of a spectral clustering method for shared bicycle trajectories"}, {"paperId": "3f6ae8f0f5446dac4de123987e334ec532a9ac66", "title": "Do Locations of Employment and Residence Influence whether People Use Virtual Social Networks?
