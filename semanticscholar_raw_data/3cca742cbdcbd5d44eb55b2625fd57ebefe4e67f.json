Such issues were targeted by many researchers and still an interesting field in the meantime. One important issue is to analyze big data frameworks and compromise this data and make it a tool for decision making. The big data needs more sophisticated analysis paradigm rather than those used to analyze traditional data due to the big data characteristics. Several approaches to big data analysis were proposed in the literature, those should be spotted are the approaches that take advantage of parallel processing due to its capability, promising, and remarkable results. A various implementations for MapReduce has been proven as a successful implementation. This research aims to discuss some of the current multi-GPU MapReduce frameworks for big data analysis considering the point of parallel data processing. In addition, various and comprehensive comparisons of those frameworks.
