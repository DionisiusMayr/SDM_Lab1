The need for ubiquitous communication, computing, and caching resources in 5G beyond will lead to a growing demand to integrate heterogeneous resources into the edge network. Furthermore, distributed edge services can make resource transactions vulnerable to malicious nodes. Ensuring secure edge services under complex industrial networks is a big challenge. In this article, we present an edge intelligence and blockchain empowered IIoT framework, which achieves flexible and secure edge service management. Then we propose a cross-domain sharing inspired edge resource scheduling scheme and design a credit-differentiated edge transaction approval mechanism. Numerical results indicate that the proposed schemes bring significant improvement in both edge service cost and service capacities.", "venue": "IEEE Network", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy":
