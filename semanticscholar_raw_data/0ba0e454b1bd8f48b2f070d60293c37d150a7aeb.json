Healthcare big data comprise data from different structured, semi-structured, and unstructured sources. These data sources vary in terms of heterogeneity, volume, variety, velocity, and value that traditional frameworks, algorithms, tools, and techniques are not fully capable of handling. Therefore, a framework is required that facilitates collection, extraction, storage, classification, processing, and modeling of this vast heterogeneous volume of data. This paper proposes a healthcare big data framework using voice pathology assessment (VPA) as a case study. In the proposed VPA system, two robust features, MPEG-7 low-level audio and the interlaced derivative pattern, are used for processing the voice or speech signals. The machine learning algorithms in the form of a support vector machine, an extreme learning machine, and a Gaussian mixture model are used as the classifier. In the experiments, the proposed VPA system shows its efficiency in terms of accuracy and time requirement.", "venue": "IEEE Access", "year": 2016, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2016-11-08", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Access", "pages": "7806-7815", "volume": "4"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2107176546", "name": "M.
