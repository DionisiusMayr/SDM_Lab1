For an application represented by a complex work\ufb02ow, it is dif\ufb01cult for the consumer to decide what type of infrastructure they need to meet the Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements and achieve objectives like monetary cost optimisation. We call such problem as the virtual infrastructure planning problem in cloud. Most existing studies focus on only one single deadline-constrained work\ufb02ow planning. The single deadline constraint usually refers to a global deadline since the start execution of a work\ufb02ow to its \ufb01nish. However, such simple model cannot allow a time critical application to specify internal deadlines inside the work\ufb02ow. To allow such \ufb02exibility for consumers, we propose a multi-deadline model and consider the virtual infrastructure planning problem for work\ufb02ow with multi-deadline constraints. To solve the problem ef\ufb01ciently, we propose a Multiple-Deadline overlapping-based Infrastructure Planning (MDIP) algorithm. In MDIP, we de\ufb01ne the criticality of tasks by analysing the deadline coverages. Then we rank the tasks in the work\ufb02ow by their criticality and assign them with VM type of better performance. To evaluate the effectiveness of our algorithm, we compare it with a meta-heuristic solution (Genetic Algorithm-based) and a hybrid solution combining critical path and genetic algorithm. Simulated experiments show our approach can achieve better results than existing solutions and more ef\ufb01cient than GA-based solution.
