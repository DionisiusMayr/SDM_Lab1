Traditional evaluation methods are time-consuming and labor-intensive, and at the same time problems such as incomplete information and delayed feedback go along with them. In regard to this situation, this paper proposes to construct a comprehensive ability evaluation (CAE) system for business ET based on the perspective of intelligent algorithm. The article first states the current situation of business ET, then discusses the role of teaching CAE. Next it studies the application of intelligent algorithms, and on this basis, tests for the security of the evaluation system have been conducted. The test results show that the system has a high utilization rate of resources, which means the system can aid students\u2019 learning effectively. Also, the system runs well, has high security, and is convenient to operate, which can help teachers master students\u2019 learning situation and improve teaching level with efficiency.", "venue": "International Conference on Communication Systems and Network Technologies", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-04-08", "journal": {"name": "2023 IEEE 12th International Conference on Communication Systems and Network Technologies (CSNT)", "pages": "637-641"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2112599708", "name": "Yan Wei"}], "citations": []}
