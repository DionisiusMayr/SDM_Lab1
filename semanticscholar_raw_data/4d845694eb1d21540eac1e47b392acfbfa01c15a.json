This framework provides a sophisticated place for people to report various real-life events. Detecting these events with the help of natural language processing has received researchers' attention, and various algorithms have been developed for this goal. In this paper, we propose a Semantic Modular Model (SMM) consisting of 5 different modules, namely Distributional Denoising Autoencoder, Incremental Clustering, Semantic Denoising, Defragmentation, and Ranking and Processing. The proposed model aims to (1) cluster various documents and ignore the documents that might not contribute to the identification of events, (2) identify more important and descriptive keywords. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, the results show that the proposed model has a higher performance in identifying events with lower ranks and extracting keywords for more important events in three English Twitter datasets: FACup, SuperTuesday, and USElection. The proposed method outperformed the best reported results in the mean keyword-precision metric by 7.9\\%.", "venue": "Multim.
