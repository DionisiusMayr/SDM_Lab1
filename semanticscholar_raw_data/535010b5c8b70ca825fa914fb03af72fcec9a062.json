Significant barriers have prevented the full realisation of the right to health in the COVID-19 era. Big data technology, which is a vital tool for COVID-19 containment, has been a central topic of discussion, as it has been used to protect the right to health through public health surveillance, contact tracing, real-time epidemic outbreak monitoring, trend forecasting, online consultations, and the allocation of medical and health resources in China. Big data technology has enabled precise and efficient epidemic prevention and control and has improved the efficiency and accuracy of the diagnosis and treatment of this new form of coronavirus pneumonia due to Chinese institutional factors. Although big data technology has successfully supported the containment of the virus and protected the right to health in the COVID-19 era, it also risks infringing on individual privacy rights. Chinese policymakers should understand the positive and negative impacts of big data technology and should prioritise the Personal Information Protection Law and other laws that are meant to protect and strengthen the right to privacy.", "venue": "International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-07-01", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health", "volume": "18"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "119227196", "name": "Taixia Shen"}, {"authorId": "2144449132", "name": "Chao Wang"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "e98ebfc4e99066835e44db5a6d0e1dd2969663fc", "title": "Opportunities in emerging technologies for Southern Africa: How the Global South should adopt to take advantage?"}, {"paperId": "bf5b707fc65e91adfc6044694d94dd3fbd830b68", "title": "Individual Privacy and Data Protection Rights.
