Therefore, there is a need for platform for storing, managing and distributing it across multiple nodes. In the paper, we represent approach which is based on Kerberos in Hadoop distributed file system. It is used to access the right blocks of data by the authorized user only. To provide a security in Namenode, Ticket Granting Ticket and Service Ticket have been used for that. Kerberos installation in server and clients are illustrated in details.", "venue": "Journal of Physics: Conference Series", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Physics", "Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2021-02-01", "journal": {"name": "Journal of Physics: Conference Series", "volume": "1804"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1409149923", "name": "Wafaa S.
