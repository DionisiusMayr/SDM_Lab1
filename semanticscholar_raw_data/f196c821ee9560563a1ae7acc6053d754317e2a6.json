We focus on the topic of climate change/global warming, which has caused much alarm and controversy over recent years. Our intention is to recommend informative YouTube videos to those seeking a balanced viewpoint of this area and the key arguments/issues. To this end we analyze Twitter data; Reddit comments and posts; user comments, view statistics and likes/dislikes of YouTube videos. The combination of sentiment analysis with raw statistics and linking users with their posts gives deeper insights into their needs and quest for quality information. Sentiment analysis provides the insights into user likes and dislikes, graph theory provides the linkage patterns and relationships between users, posts, and sentiment.", "venue": "Inf.", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-07-16", "journal": {"name": "Inf.", "pages": "408", "volume": "14"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2223786783", "name": "Ken McGarry"}], "citations": []}
