These sophisticated services are usually both data- and computation-intensive, and must meet stringent latency and reliability requirements that cannot be readily satisfied by cloud-based service processing. Therefore, the 6G cellular network is expected to jointly optimize communication, computing, caching, and control. A further aspiration of 6G is to conceive a seamless space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) for filling the vast coverage holes across the globe, bringing new opportunities for mission-critical services. In this article, we aim for conceiving ultrareliable and low-latency edge intelligence for supporting mission-critical services by harnessing the diversified communication, computing, and caching resources at the network edge of SAGIN. We critically appraise a number of key enabling techniques, including a number of new service-centric resource allocation techniques. Finally, a range of open challenges is discussed.", "venue": "IEEE Network", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-03-01", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Network", "pages": "181-189", "volume": "36"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "50821781", "name": "Xiangwang Hou"}, {"authorId": "145210497", "name": "JingJing Wang"}, {"authorId": "1753609648", "name": "Zhengru Fang"}, {"authorId": "2109892494", "name": "Y.
