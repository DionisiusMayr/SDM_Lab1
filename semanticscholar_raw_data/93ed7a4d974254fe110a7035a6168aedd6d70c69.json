However, Existing clustering techniques suffer from several shortcomings such as sensitivity to the initial value, slow convergence, etc... In this paper, the Bond Energy Algorithm (BEA) has been used for clustering Arabic documents. The bond energy algorithm has been modified with the help of a Genetic algorithm to enhance the accuracy of the results. The efficiency of modified BEA has been compared to BEA baseline and K-means clustering in terms of precision, recall, and F-Score. The results show that Modified BEA can be used for clustering Arabic Documents, and the efficiency of the algorithm can be enhanced in the future to give a better result.", "venue": "International Conference on Information, Communications and Signal Processing", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-06-21", "journal": {"name": "2022 13th International Conference on Information and Communication Systems (ICICS)", "pages": "4-8"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "28279590", "name": "Hadeel Alazzam"}, {"authorId": "114388844", "name": "Orieb Abualghanam"}, {"authorId": "10749329", "name": "Abdulsalam Alsmady"}, {"authorId": "72630133", "name": "Esra'a Alhenawi"}], "citations": []}
