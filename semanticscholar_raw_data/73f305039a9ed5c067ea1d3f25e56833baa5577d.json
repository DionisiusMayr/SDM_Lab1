Containers provide the ability to create lightweight and portable runtime environments that decouple the application requirements from the characteristics of the underlying system. Services built on containers have a small resource footprint in terms of processing, storage, memory and network, allowing a more dense deployment environment. While the performance of such containers is addressed in few previous studies, understanding the failure-repair behavior of the containers remains unexplored. In this paper, from an availability point of view, we propose and compare different configuration models for deploying a containerized software system. Inspired by Google Kubernetes, a container management system, these configurations are characterized with a failure response and migration service. We develop novel non-state-space (i.e., fault tree) and state-space (i.e., stochastic reward net) analytic models for container availability analysis. Analytical as well as simulative solutions are obtained for the developed models. Our analysis provides insights on k out-of N availability and sensitivity of system availability for key system parameters. Finally, we build an open-source software tool powered by these models. The tool helps a Cloud administrator to assess the availability of a containerized system and to conduct a what-if analysis based on user-provided parameters and configurations.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Services Computing", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-01-01", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Transactions on Services Computing", "pages": "16-29", "volume": "14"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2291658", "name": "Stefano Sebastio"}, {"authorId": "145634631", "name": "R.
