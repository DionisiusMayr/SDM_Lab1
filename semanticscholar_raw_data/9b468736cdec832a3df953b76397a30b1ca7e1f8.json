To properly protect sensitive data, it is very important to identify sensitive data and implement data anonymization to ensure the quality and proper use of data anonymization techniques. This work focuses on proactively sensitive data identification, classification and anonymization using machine learning techniques. We first investigated the sensitive data extraction from both structured data and unstructured data, in which Bert models and Regular expressions were used to achieve the identification of sensitive data in real-time. Meanwhile, we propose a comprehensive sensitive detection framework combining the Bert model with regular expressions that can achieve high precision and good generalization capability with not so large corpus. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed solution.", "venue": "2022 19th International Computer Conference on Wavelet Active Media Technology and Information Processing (ICCWAMTIP)", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-12-16", "journal": {"name": "2022 19th International Computer Conference on Wavelet Active Media Technology and Information Processing (ICCWAMTIP)", "pages": "1-6"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2202210618", "name": "Peng Chong"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "3b7439fba17d79d2320c61b5b279cee4a85a4a66", "title": "Sensitive Word Recognition Scheme Based on Text-RCNN Model"}]}
