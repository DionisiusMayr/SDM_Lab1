Therapeutic options include steroids, immunosuppressants, anti-TNF\u03b1 agents, vedolizumab, and ustekinumab. Ustekinumab is a monoclonal antibody blocking the p40 subunit of IL-12 and IL-23. It showed to be effective and safe in randomised clinical trials and real-life studies and is currently approved for the management of CD patients who are naive to biologics and those who have already been treated with such medications. However, to date, a detailed and approved therapeutic algorithm is not available. The aim of this review is to report the most recent and updated data on the efficacy and safety of ustekinumab for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe CD and to define the optimal management of these patients.", "venue": "Journal of Crohn's & Colitis", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-04-01", "journal": {"name": "Journal of Crohn's & Colitis", "pages": "ii30 - ii41", "volume": "16"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1422394286", "name": "F.
