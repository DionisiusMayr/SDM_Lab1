It is predictable that automatic planning and scheduling for course contents are the most practical important task for smart education. As online and offline educational activities are visual behaviors, it remains challenging to capture and extract principal features. To breakthrough current barriers, this paper combines the visual perception technology and data mining theory, and proposes a multimedia knowledge discovery-based optimal scheduling approach in smart education about painting. At first, the data visualization is carried out to analyze the adaptive design of visual morphologies. On this basis, it is supposed to formulate a multimedia knowledge discovery framework which can implement multimodal inference tasks, so as to calculate specific course contents for specific individuals. At last, some simulation works are also conducted to obtain analysis results, showing that the proposed optimal scheduling scheme can work well in contents planning of smart education scenarios.", "venue": "Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-01-13", "journal": {"name": "Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE", "pages": "\n          5901-5916\n        ", "volume": "20 3"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2201150793", "name": "Zhipeng Ding"}, {"authorId": "2201078265", "name": "Hongxia Yun"}, {"authorId": "2053811685", "name": "Enze Li"}], "citations": []}
