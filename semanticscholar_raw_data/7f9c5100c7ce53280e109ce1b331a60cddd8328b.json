The cost model can be used to find an initial placement of operators across heterogeneous hardware, which is particularly important in these environments. In our evaluation, we demonstrate that COSTREAM can produce highly accurate cost estimates for the initial operator placement and even generalize to unseen placements, queries, and hardware. When using COSTREAM to optimize the placements of streaming operators, a median speed-up of around 21x can be achieved compared to baselines.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-03-13", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2403.08444"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2175558231", "name": "Roman Heinrich"}, {"authorId": "2286376197", "name": "Carsten Binnig"}, {"authorId": "2288821270", "name": "Harald Kornmayer"}, {"authorId": "47908048", "name": "Manisha Luthra"}], "citations": []}
