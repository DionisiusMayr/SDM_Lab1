The Manufacturing Execution System (MES), Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems used by companies provide excellent support in data recording, processes, and storing. For Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) data showing the efficiency of assembly lines, there is a regular need to determine expected values. This paper focuses on OEE values prediction with Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) as supervised machine learning. Many factors affecting OEE (e.g., downtimes, cycle time) are examined and analyzed in order to make a more accurate estimation. Based on real industrial data, we used four different methods to perform prediction with various machine learning algorithms, these were the cumulative, fix rolling horizon, optimal rolling horizon and combined techniques. Each method is evaluated based on similar mathematical formulas.", "venue": "Periodica Polytechnica: Mechanical Engineering", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-09-07", "journal": {"name": "Periodica Polytechnica Mechanical Engineering"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1659402748", "name": "P\u00e9ter Dobra"}, {"authorId": "69400615", "name": "J.
