This chapter builds on the concepts of data management and analytics in SG to build the foundation needed for data analytics to transform Big Data for high\u2010value action. Big data sources in SG generally fall into two main categories; electric utility data sources and supplementary data sources. The Big Data system will store, process, and mine information in an efficient manner to enhance different SG services. The chapter presents a list of the most common big data tools utilized by successful analytics developers to store, manage, and analyze big data. Big Data needs additional convincing methods to handle the massive amount of information in a limited time span. Any data exchange in SG must be effectively protected through specific \u201cPrivacy Concerns\u201d which have potential privacy impacts of SG and smart meter systems.", "venue": "Smart Grid and Enabling Technologies", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2021-07-30", "journal": {"name": "Smart Grid and Enabling Technologies"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "8930231", "name": "S.
