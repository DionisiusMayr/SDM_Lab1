Sparse signal processing and representation is the outcome of this line of research which has many applications in information processing and has shown significant improvement in real-world applications such as recovery, classification, clustering, super resolution, etc. This vast influence of sparse signal processing in real-world problems raises a significant need in developing novel sparse signal representation algorithms to obtain more robust systems. In such algorithms, a few open challenges remain in (a) efficiently posing sparsity on signals that can capture the structure of underlying signal and (b) the design of tractable algorithms that can recover signals under aforementioned sparse models.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2017-08-16", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/1805.04828"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2223691", "name": "Hojjat Seyed Mousavi"}], "citations": []}
