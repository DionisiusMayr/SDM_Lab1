A cooperative coevolution approach is a good tool for increasing the performance of an evolutionary algorithm in solving high-dimensional optimization problems. However, the performance of cooperative coevolution approaches for LSGO depends significantly on the problem decomposition, namely, on the number of subcomponents and on how variables are grouped in these subcomponents. Also, the choice of the population size is still an open question for population-based algorithms. This paper discusses a method for selecting the number of subcomponents and the population size during the optimization process (\u201con fly\u201d) from a predefined pool of parameters. The selection of the parameters is based on their performance in the previous optimization steps. The main goal of the study is the improvement of coevolutionary decomposition-based algorithms for solving LSGO problems. In this paper, we propose a novel self-adapt evolutionary algorithm for solving continuous LSGO problems. We have tested this algorithm on 15 optimization problems from the IEEE LSGO CEC\u20192013 benchmark suite. The proposed approach, on average, outperforms cooperative coevolution algorithms with a static number of subcomponents and a static number of individuals.", "venue": "Algorithms", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-11-29", "journal": {"name": "Algorithms", "pages": "451", "volume": "15"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2164579179", "name": "Aleksei Vakhnin"}, {"authorId": "2915516", "name": "E.
