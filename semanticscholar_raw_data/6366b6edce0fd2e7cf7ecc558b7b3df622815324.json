We compared the clinical response rates at 3 months in 2 cohorts of biologic-na\u00efve patients treated by ustekinumab and anti-TNF agents.\n\n\nMETHODS\nBiologic-na\u00efve patients starting either ustekinumab or an anti-TNF agent for luminal CD between 2016 and 2019 in 2 tertiary centers were retrospectively included. The primary endpoint was clinical response at 3 months, defined as a Harvey-Bradshaw Index <4 or a 3-point drop in the score without steroids, need for CD-related surgery, or treatment discontinuation owing to failure or intolerance. Patients treated with ustekinumab were matched to patients receiving anti-TNF agents by a propensity score algorithm.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe included 156 patients starting anti-TNF agents (95 adalimumab and 61 infliximab) and 50 ustekinumab. After matching, clinical response rates at 3 months were 64% and 86% in the ustekinumab and anti-TNF groups, respectively (P\u2005=\u2005.01). At 12 months, in multivariate analysis adjusted for disease duration, location, concomitant immunosuppressant and steroids, and symptoms, clinical remission was independently associated with the biological therapy received (odds ratio, 2.6 for anti-TNF agent vs ustekinumab; P\u2005=\u2005.02). With a median follow-up duration of 40 (interquartile range, 23-52) months, no difference was observed in terms of time to drug withdrawal (P\u2005=\u2005.29) or safety.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis retrospective real-world data suggest that an anti-TNF agent as a first-line biological therapy is associated with higher rates of response at 3 months than ustekinumab in patients with CD.", "venue": "Inflammatory Bowel Diseases", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-08-02", "journal": {"name": "Inflammatory bowel diseases"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "39905914", "name": "P.
