Indeed, complex data require expressive data representation models such as graph representation. The Linked Open Data (LOD) movement along with the FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, Reusability) data principles are intended to facilitate heterogeneous data integration and analyses. In the LOD context, graphs are called knowledge graphs as they encompass domain ontologies for typing objects and describing their relationships. Semantic web languages (RDFS, OWL, SPARQL) have reached an interesting level of maturity on which ambitious machine learning techniques can rely. Interestingly, big data and NoSQL solutions make possible web-scale data analyses. So far, such analyses on dedicated big-data architectures are o en limited to MapReduce scenarios on rather simple data models (key-value oriented, homogeneous graphs with only one type of nodes and one type of edges). Graph databases, as one NoSQL approach, allow for rich representation of multi-typed attributed nodes and edges. This better expressivity comes with a cost as graph and program distribution is not an easy task.", "venue": "", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [], "citations": []}
