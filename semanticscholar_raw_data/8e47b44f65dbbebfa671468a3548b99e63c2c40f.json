DEGAS includes novel asynchronous variants of ADMM and block-coordinate descent as special cases. We prove that DEGAS converges under both bounded and unbounded delays under delay-free parameter conditions. We also validate by theory and experiments that DEGAS adapts well to the actual delays. The effectiveness of DEGAS is demonstrated by numerical experiments on classification problems.", "venue": "International Conference on Machine Learning", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-05-15", "journal": {"pages": "37582-37606"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3367161", "name": "Xuyang Wu"}, {"authorId": "123346720", "name": "Changxin Liu"}, {"authorId": "31783616", "name": "S.
