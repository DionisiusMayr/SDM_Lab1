However, efficiently coordinating and securing flocks of heterogeneous UAVs from different service providers poses significant challenges related to privacy, scalability, lightweight consensus protocols, and comprehensive cybersecurity mechanisms. This study introduces a robust blockchain-enabled framework designed to tackle these technical challenges through a combination of consensus protocols, smart contracts, and cryptographic techniques. First, we propose a consortium blockchain architecture that ensures secure and private multi-agency coordination by controlling access and safeguarding the privacy of sensitive data. Second, we develop an optimized hybrid consensus protocol that merges Delegated Proof of Stake and Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (DPOS-PBFT), aiming to achieve an effective balance between efficiency, security, and resilience against node failures. Finally, we introduce decentralized flocking algorithms that facilitate adaptable and autonomous operations among specialized UAV clusters, ensuring critical disaster relief functions under conditions of uncertain connectivity. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate the system achieved linear scaling of throughput up to 500 UAV nodes, with only a 50ms increase in latency from 10 to 500 nodes. The framework maintained high throughput and low latency despite spoofing, denial-of-service (DoS), and tampering attacks, showing strong cyber resilience. Communication latencies were kept under 10ms for diverse UAV operations through self-optimizing network intelligence, with median values around 2-3ms.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Engineering"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-03-05", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2403.04796"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1654099525", "name": "S.
