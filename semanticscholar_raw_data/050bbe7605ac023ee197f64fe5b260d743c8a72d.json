So, such data objects in the same cluster are similar hence data objects in other clusters are different. This paper presents a model that includes methods for ensuring not only detecting outliers but also handling noisy data in real-time and offline as well. Furthermore, by using the improved tree-based clustering algorithm there is no need to initialize number of clusters in advance. Experimental results, applied to hotels and flights, find that this proposed model achieves high-quality results without outliers in less time on real datasets.", "venue": "", "year": null, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2260580294", "name": "Helal A.
