Processing-in-Memory (PIM) is an alternative solution to reduce the data movement between memory and processors, and it results in better performance and reduced energy consumption. However, prior PIM-based graph processing work operated only on static graphs. In fact, real-world graphs are constantly changing as their data is updated. In this paper, we will discuss design considerations for adapting dynamic graph processing to PIM.", "venue": "International Symposium on Memory Systems", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-09-28", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the International Symposium on Memory Systems"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "5191432", "name": "Euna Kim"}, {"authorId": "8187053", "name": "Hyesoon Kim"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "67b1e1eeb5d7af8ea7d880cd561b81d85d89144b", "title": "Heterogeneous Data-Centric Architectures for Modern Data-Intensive Applications: Case Studies in Machine Learning and Databases"}]}
