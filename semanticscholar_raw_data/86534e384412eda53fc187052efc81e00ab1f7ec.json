First, we hypothesize that the participation of a well-performed individual as an elite can accelerate the convergence of optimization. Based on this hypoth- esis, in the \ufb01rst stage, we cluster the cities and decompose the LSTSPs into multiple subcomponents, and each subcomponent is optimized with a reusable Pointer Network (PtrNet). After subcomponents optimization, we combine all sub-tours to form a valid solution, this solution joins the second stage of optimization with GA. We validate the performance of our proposal on 10 LSTSPs and compare it with traditional EAs. Experimental results show that the participation of an elite individual can greatly accelerate the optimization of LSTSPs, and our proposal has broad prospects for dealing with LSTSPs.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-09-27", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2209.13077"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2068352785", "name": "Rui Zhong"}, {"authorId": "146677756", "name": "En-zhan Zhang"}, {"authorId": "1687699", "name": "M.
