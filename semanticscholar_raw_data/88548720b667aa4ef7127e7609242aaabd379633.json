Failure in some computing systems like avionics may cause catastrophic consequences. Therefore, managing reliability under all circumstances of stress and environmental changes is crucial in all abstraction layers, from application to transistor levels. Machine learning techniques are recently being employed for dynamic reliability estimation and optimization. They can adapt to varying workloads and system conditions. This paper presents reliability improvement approaches from multiple perspectives-from transistor-level to application-level-and discusses their effectiveness and limitations as well as open challenges.", "venue": "Design, Automation and Test in Europe", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-04-01", "journal": {"name": "2023 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition (DATE)", "pages": "1-10"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "114998925", "name": "Behnaz Ranjbar"}, {"authorId": "1742172979", "name": "F.
