However, few articles have investigated the influence of exploiting BDA in data-driven decision-making from an empirical perspective in a case study context. Accordingly, we aim to tackle this scarcity of case-study research addressing the interrelationships between SCs, BDA, and decision-making. Filling this gap will shed light on the challenges and design principles that should be considered in designing a BDA artifact in the domain of smart cities. We analyze a case study of a digital transformation project in Egypt. Results show a tangible positive effect of utilizing data analytics in support of the decision-making process.", "venue": "Applied Sciences", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-02-08", "journal": {"name": "Applied Sciences"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "144180191", "name": "Ahmed M.
