It is widely used in indoor positioning, medical monitoring, safe driving, etc. Existing activity recognition approaches require either the location information of the sensors or the specific domain knowledge, which are expensive, intrusive, and inconvenient for pervasive implementation. In this paper, a human activity recognition algorithm based on SDAE (Stacking Denoising Autoencoder) and LightGBM (LGB) is proposed. The SDAE is adopted to sanitize the noise in raw sensor data and extract the most effective characteristic expression with unsupervised learning. The LGB reveals the inherent feature dependencies among categories for accurate human activity recognition. Extensive experiments are conducted on four datasets of distinct sensor combinations collected by different devices in three typical application scenarios, which are human moving modes, current static, and dynamic behaviors of users. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm achieves an average accuracy of 95.99%, outperforming other comparative algorithms using XGBoost, CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), CNN + Statistical features, or single SDAE.", "venue": "Italian National Conference on Sensors", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2019-02-01", "journal": {"name": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "volume": "19"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "71886378", "name": "Xile Gao"}, {"authorId": "34288367", "name": "Haiyong Luo"}, {"authorId": "30698546", "name": "Qu Wang (\u738b\u66f2\uff09"}, {"authorId": "49372796", "name": "Fang Zhao"}, {"authorId": "79304728", "name": "L.
