Authentication plays a vital role to prevent various security threats. Each user/driver of the vehicle is having social network user profiles. These social network profiles are used to authenticate the vehicles in WVANET. The malicious driver may disseminate false information among the nodes. When a driver is authenticated through a social network profile, the complete details of the driver are known and the person is under the control. This type of authentication, will ensure less misbehavior among the nodes. When the nodes are authenticated successfully through the OSN profile, the nodes are marked as \u201cVerified\u201d and the nodes which are not authenticated are marked as \u201cNot-Verified\u201d. The Verified nodes can send and receive messages whereas the Not-Verified nodes can receive the message only. In this paper, Whatsapp and Facebook are used to authenticate the nodes of WVANET", "venue": "International Journal Artificial Intelligent and Informatics", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-04-01", "journal": {"name": "International Journal Artificial Intelligent and Informatics"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2161048954", "name": "M.
