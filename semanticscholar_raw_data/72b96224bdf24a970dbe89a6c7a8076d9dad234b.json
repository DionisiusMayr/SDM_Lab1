Predictive maintenance implies high costs for the hotel sector, so that a low-cost energy-efficient design is essential. The proposed framework is based in the general framework proposed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology and is inspired in the three-layer IoT architecture. This fact also provides the system with interoperability and flexibility. Finally, an application of the framework in a real installation \u2013 a five-star hotel - is also presented.", "venue": "2022 International Conference on Electrical, Computer and Energy Technologies (ICECET)", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-07-20", "journal": {"name": "2022 International Conference on Electrical, Computer and Energy Technologies (ICECET)", "pages": "1-8"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1879004527", "name": "Samuel Dom\u00ednguez-Cid"}, {"authorId": "2501270", "name": "J.
