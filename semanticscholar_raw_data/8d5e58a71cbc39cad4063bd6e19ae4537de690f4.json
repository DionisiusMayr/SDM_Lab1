Such an understanding will enable users to ensure the apps they download are secure and create greater awareness in the marketplace of the presence of hackers and malware used to invade the privacy and personal details of smartphones users. Research on the perception of users' mobile security is very limited and needs further investigation. This study aims to identify how mobile users perceive the security of different mobile apps and the extent to which different apps affect such perceptions. This study also investigates mobile user preferences for the places where they can access apps and their perceptions of risk at marketplaces vs. websites. This study is based on a qualitative research in which interviews were conducted with 32 university students. The study found that mobile users do not feel secure when installing mobile apps, and that concerns about hacking personal and private information are pervasive. Users expressed more security concerns regarding entertainment apps such as games and communication rather than financial apps, such as banking. The study also found that users prefer installing apps from app stores. The findings of this research contribute a greater understanding of how mobile users perceive mobile app security and offers insights that will help developers adjust their security policies to ensure users' security. The study also presents theoretical and empirical contributions, along with limitations and suggestions for further work.", "venue": "Int. J. E Serv. Mob.
