But the influence of various performance tuning parameters on the overall application speedup is no-linear and it is also dependent on the application/data characteristics. This work models the problem of finding the optimal values for tuning parameters as a search optimization problem and proposes a hybrid meta heuristics solution to problem based on combining grass hopper swarm optimization with bat algorithm. The hybrid algorithm has good exploration and exploitation ability so that the optimal solution is found without getting into local minimal problem.", "venue": "2023 4th IEEE Global Conference for Advancement in Technology (GCAT)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-10-06", "journal": {"name": "2023 4th IEEE Global Conference for Advancement in Technology (GCAT)", "pages": "1-6"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "35440406", "name": "Nandita Yambem"}, {"authorId": "2275465849", "name": "B.
