Decision- makers need to analyze and understand a huge volume of opinions continuously generated in digital ecosystems about emotions and feelings that their stakeholders associate with the performance and communication of the brand. Current tools of management fail to consider transversal and holistic models, which study the frequency and value of existing relationships between the relational capital and intangible assets. In this research, an innovative management model based on reputation intelligence is proposed. This model incorporates methodology from business intelligence models, through OLAP and data mining techniques, to analyses the complex relationships among intangible assets experience, emotion and attitude. The proposed model was applied to companies in the banking sector and the results obtained permit a conclusion about the kinds of relationships for these intangibles in each bank.", "venue": "International Journal of Information Systems in the Service Sector", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Business"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2019-10-01", "journal": {"name": "Int.
