Therefore, research was undertaken to develop a prediction model for detecting leaks in vacuum furnaces, the use of which will reduce the risk of degradation in the charge being processed. Unique experimental studies were carried out to detect leakages in a vacuum pit furnace, simulated using the ENV 116 reference slot. As a consequence, a prediction model for the detection of leaks in vacuum furnaces- which are used in the heat treatment of metals- was designed, using an artificial neural network. (93% for MLP 15-10-1) was developed. The model was implemented in a predictive maintenance system, in a real production company, as an element in the monitoring of the operation of vacuum furnaces.", "venue": "Eksploatacja i Niezawodnosc - Maintenance and Reliability", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-08-30", "journal": {"name": "Eksploatacja i Niezawodnosc - Maintenance and Reliability"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3018255", "name": "S.
