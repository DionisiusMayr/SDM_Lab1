Besides, the resource limitation of IoT devices such as tiny battery power, small storage capacity, and low calculation speed made its security a big challenge for the researchers. Therefore, in this study, a new technique is proposed called intrusion detection system based on spike neural network and decision tree (IDS-SNNDT). In this method, the DT is used to select the optimal samples that will be hired as input to the SNN, while SNN utilized the non-leaky integrate neurons fire (NLIF) model in order to reduce latency and minimize devices\u2019 power usage. Also, a rand order code (ROC) technique is used with SNN to detect cyber-attacks. The proposed method is evaluated by comparing its performance with two other methods: IDS-DNN and IDS-SNNTLF by using three performance metrics: detection accuracy, latency, and energy usage. The simulation results have shown that IDS-SNNDT attained low power usage and less latency in comparison with IDS-DNN and IDS-SNNTLF methods. Also, IDS-SNNDT has achieved high detection accuracy for cyber-attacks in contrast with IDS-SNNTLF.", "venue": "International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering (IJECE)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2023-04-01", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering (IJECE)"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2196321770", "name": "Ahmed R.
