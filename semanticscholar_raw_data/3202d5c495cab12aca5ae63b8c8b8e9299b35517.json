In this study, a magnetic scaffold was fabricated using fused deposition modeling with calcium silicate (CS), iron oxide nanoparticles (Fe3O4), and poly-\u03b5-caprolactone (PCL) as the matrix for internal magnetic sources. A static magnetic field was used as an external magnetic source. It was observed that 5% Fe3O4 provided a favorable combination of compressive strength (9.6 \u00b1 0.9 MPa) and degradation rate (21.6 \u00b1 1.9% for four weeks). Furthermore, the Fe3O4-containing scaffold increased in vitro bioactivity and Wharton\u2019s jelly mesenchymal stem cells\u2019 (WJMSCs) adhesion. Moreover, it was shown that the Fe3O4-containing scaffold enhanced WJMSCs\u2019 proliferation, alkaline phosphatase activity, and the osteogenic-related proteins of the scaffold. Under the synergistic effect of the static magnetic field, the CS scaffold containing Fe3O4 can not only enhance cell activity but also stimulate the simultaneous secretion of collagen I and osteocalcin. Overall, our results demonstrated that Fe3O4-containing CS/PCL scaffolds could be fabricated three dimensionally and combined with a static magnetic field to affect cell behaviors, potentially increasing the likelihood of clinical applications for bone tissue engineering.", "venue": "Cells", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-12-01", "journal": {"name": "Cells", "volume": "11"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2186074212", "name": "Chuan-Yi Kao"}, {"authorId": "4202870", "name": "Tsung-Li Lin"}, {"authorId": "46394276", "name": "Yen-Hong Lin"}, {"authorId": "51268378", "name": "A.
