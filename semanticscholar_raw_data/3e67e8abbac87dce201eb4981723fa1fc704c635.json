This paper describe some parallel and distributed processing techniques like Hadoop, HIPI, Map reduce, CUDA, MPI to process massive database. Mapreduce based large-scale images processing, which exhibit high reliability and scalability in distributed and parallel environment. As highly efficient parallel data processing all these methods are used to analyze and process massive image database. In today\u2019s highly digitalized world large volume of multimedia data need to efficiently store, process and analyze This paper shows usefulness of parallel and distributed techniques.
