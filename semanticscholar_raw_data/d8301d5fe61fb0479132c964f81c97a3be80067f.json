As a result of a large number of video data that need to be processed, optimizing the performance of video analytics systems has become an important research topic. Neural networks are the state-of-the-art for performing video analytics tasks such as video annotation and object detection. Prior survey papers consider application-specific video analytics techniques that improve accuracy of the results; however, in this survey paper, we provide a review of the techniques that focus on optimizing the performance of Neural Network-Based Video Analytics Systems.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2021-05-10", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2105.14195"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2106416276", "name": "Nada Ibrahim"}, {"authorId": "2057503077", "name": "Preeti Maurya"}, {"authorId": "50461546", "name": "Omid Jafari"}, {"authorId": "2001909", "name": "P.
