One such country is Egypt, which is hit by floods every year that cost lives and bring the economy to a standstill. Moreover, not much has been done to map flood-prone areas. In this paper, flood susceptibility modelling was evaluated in the Ras Gharib region of Egypt using two effective techniques machine learning technique-MLT (Support Vector Machine (SVM)) and deep learning method-DL (Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)). Thirteen flood related factors and flood inventory layer were prepared to construct these models. Validation was performed with 30% of the flood locations where receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves showed that the deep learning technique (CNN) gave a prediction accuracy of 86.5% (high performance), while the MLTs (SVM) gave 71.6% (medium performance). The results show that CNN provides 17% better than SVM which indicates a powerful and accurate model in flood susceptibility mapping. Results were confirmed using the Astro Digital images shortly after the 2016 flood, in which the CNN model provides a good agreement.", "venue": "Geocarto International", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-03-14", "journal": {"name": "Geocarto International", "pages": "11088 - 11115", "volume": "37"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "40362177", "name": "A.
