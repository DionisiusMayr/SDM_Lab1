These anomalies can be detected approximately 20\u201322 weeks. In effect, the experts rely on manual analysis by extracting typical biometric measures from head region to interpret pregnancy evolution. The contribution of this work presents a totally computerised method of cerebral defect-recognition based on conventional neural network (CNN) in order to supply quantitative appraisal of hydrocephalus (HD) or healthy (HL) topics. The obtained results have achieved an important classification (Accuracy = 97.20%, sensitivity = 97.95% and specificity = 98.23%) when applying the CNN. The proposed methodology enables us to assess the anomalous cases in premature period within a reduced processing time. Experimental results prove the success of the proposed rating system for a suitable diagnostic of foetal head hydrocephalus when compared to previous work.", "venue": "Comput. methods Biomech.
