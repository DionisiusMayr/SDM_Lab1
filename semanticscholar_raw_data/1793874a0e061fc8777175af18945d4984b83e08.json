The obtained set of identified changes in images, obtained for numerous parameters settings of the device, were the base for statistical analysis. This analysis makes it possible to determine the Pearson\u2019s linear correlation coefficient between the parameters being changed and the image of the failures. In the second stage of the research, artificial intelligence methods were applied to construct a multilayer neural network (MLP) and to teach it appropriate identification of damage. In both methods, the same data sets were used, which made it possible to compare methods.", "venue": "Energies", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2021-05-07", "journal": {"name": "Energies", "pages": "3081", "volume": "14"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2114315612", "name": "D.
