In this paper, the deployment of wireless sensor networks is investigated on the battlefield in terms of specific parameters such as node power, latency, and network survival. It investigates the simulated environment at three different levels while using a network simulator. Continuous data gathering and significant power consumption are necessary during the early deployment phase of wireless sensor networks. The wiring stage is then where power usage is highlighted. The transmit phase is when delay estimation is lastly carried out.", "venue": "2022 2nd International Conference on Technological Advancements in Computational Sciences (ICTACS)", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-10-10", "journal": {"name": "2022 2nd International Conference on Technological Advancements in Computational Sciences (ICTACS)", "pages": "700-704"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2144306154", "name": "A.
