However, the growth of IoT technologies can be enhanced by integrating them with cloud computing. Hence, a new area of computing called IoT Cloud or CloudIoT has emerged. That is, the data collected from the IoT technologies are stored and processed in the cloud infrastructure so that IoT technologies are relived from resources constrained issue. As a result, some new classes of security and privacy issues are introduced. This paper presents security issues pertaining to IoT cloud.", "venue": "", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "1396343228", "name": "Nawaf Almolhis"}, {"authorId": "40945707", "name": "M.
