Traditional methods simply predicting \"when the available resources is exhausted\" are not effective due to customer demand fragmentation and platform allocation constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel prediction approach which proactively predicts the level of resource allocation failures from the perspective of low capacity status. By jointly considering the data from different sources in both time series form and static form, the proposed approach can make accurate LCS predictions in a complex and dynamic cloud environment, and thereby improve the service availability of cloud systems. The proposed approach is evaluated by real-world datasets collected from a large scale public cloud platform, and the results confirm its effectiveness.", "venue": "ESEC/SIGSOFT FSE", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-08-18", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 29th ACM Joint Meeting on European Software Engineering Conference and Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "145153805", "name": "Hang Dong"}, {"authorId": "2054558542", "name": "Si Qin"}, {"authorId": "2146647593", "name": "Yong Xu"}, {"authorId": "2007693904", "name": "Bo Qiao"}, {"authorId": "1884408", "name": "Shandan Zhou"}, {"authorId": "101117944", "name": "Xian Yang"}, {"authorId": "2153561265", "name": "Chuan Luo"}, {"authorId": "2007757792", "name": "Pu Zhao"}, {"authorId": "2793487", "name": "Qingwei Lin"}, {"authorId": "46702864", "name": "Hongyu Zhang"}, {"authorId": "133551208", "name": "Abulikemu Abuduweili"}, {"authorId": "118791805", "name": "Sanjay Ramanujan"}, {"authorId": "2095941948", "name": "K.
