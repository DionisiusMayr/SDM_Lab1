To minimize the expensive data I/O, \"in-situ\" analysis is a promising approach, where data analysis applications analyze the simulation generated data on the fly without storing it first. However, it is challenging to organize, transform, and transport data at scales between two semantically different ecosystems due to the distinct software and hardware difference. To tackle these challenges, we design and implement the X-Composer framework. X-Composer connects cross-ecosystem applications to form an \"in-situ\" scientific workflow, and provides a unified approach and recipe for supporting such hybrid in-situ workflows on distributed heterogeneous resources. X-Composer reorganizes simulation data as continuous data streams and feeds them seamlessly into the Cloud-based stream processing services to minimize I/O overheads. For evaluation, we use X-Composer to set up and execute a cross-ecosystem workflow, which consists of a parallel Computational Fluid Dynamics simulation running on HPC, and a distributed Dynamic Mode Decomposition analysis application running on Cloud. Our experimental results show that X-Composer can seamlessly couple HPC and Big Data jobs in their own native environments, achieve good scalability, and provide high-fidelity analytics for ongoing simulations in real-time.", "venue": "Platform for Advanced Scientific Computing Conference", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-07-05", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the Platform for Advanced Scientific Computing Conference"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2146315163", "name": "Feng Li"}, {"authorId": "50978219", "name": "Dali Wang"}, {"authorId": "145552742", "name": "Feng Yan"}, {"authorId": "2495855", "name": "Fengguang Song"}], "citations": []}
