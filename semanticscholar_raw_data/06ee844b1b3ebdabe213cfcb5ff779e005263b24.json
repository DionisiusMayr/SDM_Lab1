In this paper, we focus on the incorporation of XSD constraints for XML data sources in SHACL shapes. We define a translation from XSD to SHACL, and provide a corresponding system. We compare our solution with XMLSchema2ShEx which translates XSD constraints to ShEx and validate our solution against two use cases. Our solution provides the desired SHACL shapes in a reasonable time. This allows us to automatically derive SHACL shapes for some original raw data without any manual effort.", "venue": "International Conference on Knowledge Capture", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book"], "publicationDate": "2023-12-05", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 12th Knowledge Capture Conference 2023"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2267506504", "name": "Xuemin Duan"}, {"authorId": "1404333852", "name": "David Chaves-Fraga"}, {"authorId": "2267499807", "name": "Anastasia Dimou"}], "citations": []}
