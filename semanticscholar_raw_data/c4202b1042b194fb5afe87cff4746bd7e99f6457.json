FaaS functions are stateless by nature, leading to high elasticity and transparent invocation. Supporting stateful applications, however, requires integrating data storage in FaaS, which is not trivial in an edge-cloud environment. We propose Enoki, an architecture for stateful FaaS computing replicated across the edge-cloud continuum. Enoki integrates a replicated key-value store with single-node FaaS systems at edge and cloud nodes in order to provide low-latency local data access for functions without breaking the abstraction of the FaaS programming model. We evaluate Enoki with microbenchmarks on an open-source prototype and demonstrate building a stateful FaaS application with multiple functions distributed over edge and cloud.", "venue": "MIDDLEWEDGE@Middleware", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book"], "publicationDate": "2023-09-07", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 2nd International Workshop on Middleware for the Edge"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "52198091", "name": "Tobias Pfandzelter"}, {"authorId": "3077067", "name": "David Bermbach"}], "citations": []}
