In order to improve the accuracy and efficiency of power grid data analysis, this paper proposes a three-dimensional visualization analysis system of power grid operation state data. Through the combination of 3D visualization technology, the configuration structure of the system is optimized. Improve the system software function, improve the system transmission algorithm, realize the accurate analysis of massive data. To ensure the fast, accurate and effective evaluation of power supply performance of each substation. Finally, the experimental results show that the developed 3D visualization analysis system of large-scale power grid operation state data has high application value and fully meets the research requirements.", "venue": "International Symposium on Parameterized and Exact Computation", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2021-04-14", "journal": {"name": "2021 IEEE Asia-Pacific Conference on Image Processing, Electronics and Computers (IPEC)", "pages": "196-203"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2122295159", "name": "Jie Pan"}, {"authorId": "2089574470", "name": "Haojin Qi"}, {"authorId": "9447179", "name": "Ruiyun Zheng"}], "citations": []}
