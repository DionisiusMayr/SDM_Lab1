In DFS, the metadata service, as the core component, often becomes a performance bottleneck. Existing metadata service solutions have implemented flattened metadata management and full-path indexing to achieve high scalability in terms of capacity and throughput. However, these approaches have limitations, such as conflicts with POSIX-style permission verification and flawed support for super directories, leading to high and unstable latency that cannot provide reliable service for latency-sensitive applications. To overcome these limitations, we propose Duplex, a scalable DFS metadata service based on full-path indexing, which aims for low and stable latency. Duplex incorporates three key designs: a fast access path featuring a centralized permission server for efficient permission verification, a permission merging algorithm to reduce the PMS's space footprint, and flattened metadata management based on double consistent hashing that enables low-latency access to super directories. Our evaluations demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art metadata solutions, Duplex significantly reduces the average lookup latency by up to 84% and the 99th percentile tail latency by up to 88.2% for metadataintensive benchmarks. Additionally, Duplex improves the lookup IOPS by up to 7.6 \u00d7 /2.3\u00d7 compared to CephFS and BeeGFS.", "venue": "ICCD", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-11-06", "journal": {"name": "2023 IEEE 41st International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)", "pages": "283-290"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2087077232", "name": "Chaos Dong"}, {"authorId": "2276197460", "name": "Fang Wang"}, {"authorId": "2275991281", "name": "Yuxin Yang"}, {"authorId": "1752857051", "name": "Mengya Lei"}, {"authorId": "2197474288", "name": "Jianshun Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2241570577", "name": "Dan Feng"}], "citations": []}
