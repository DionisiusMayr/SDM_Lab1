In this paper, we propose a distributed query processing method to efficiently search a subgraph for a large graph on Spark. To reduce unnecessary processing costs, the search order is determined by filtering scores using the probability distribution. The partitioned queries are searched in parallel in the distributed graph of each slave node according to the search order, and the local search results obtained from each slave node are combined and returned. The query is partitioned in triplets based on the determined search order. The performance of the proposed method is compared with the performance of existing methods to demonstrate its superiority.", "venue": "Electronics", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-08-29", "journal": {"name": "Electronics"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "145012962", "name": "Kyoungsoo Bok"}, {"authorId": "2236786565", "name": "Minyoung Kim"}, {"authorId": "1576164855", "name": "Hyeonbyeong Lee"}, {"authorId": "2422171", "name": "Dojin Choi"}, {"authorId": "3254700", "name": "Jongtae Lim"}, {"authorId": "2115662053", "name": "Jaesoo Yoo"}], "citations": []}
