Massive transaction data are routinely recorded in a variety of applications such as retail commerce, bank systems, and website management. Transaction data record the timestamp and relevant reference data needed for a particular transaction record. It is a non-trivial task for a standard ETL to process transaction data with dependencies and high velocity. This chapter presents a two-tiered segmentation approach for transaction data warehousing. The approach uses a so-called two-staging ETL method to process detailed records from operational systems, followed by a dimensional data process to populate the data store with a star or snowflake schema. The proposed approach is an all-in-one solution capable of processing fast/slowly changing data and early/late-arriving data. This chapter evaluates the proposed method, and the results have validated the effectiveness of the proposed approach for processing transaction data.", "venue": "Emerging Perspectives in Big Data Warehousing", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2019-06-01", "journal": {"name": "Emerging Perspectives in Big Data Warehousing"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2109303346", "name": "Xiufeng Liu"}, {"authorId": "2609599", "name": "Huan Huo"}, {"authorId": "1697336", "name": "N.
