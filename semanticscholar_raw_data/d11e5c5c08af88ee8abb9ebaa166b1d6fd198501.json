Container orchestration systems such as Kubernetes, which has become the de facto standard, simplify the deployment of container-based applications. However, developing efficient and well-defined orchestration systems is a challenge. This article focuses specifically on the scheduler, a key orchestrator task that assigns physical resources to containers. Scheduling approaches are designed based on different Quality of Service (QoS) parameters to provide limited response time, efficient energy consumption, better resource utilization, and other things. This article aims to establish insight knowledge into Kubernetes scheduling, find the main gaps, and thus guide future research in the area. Therefore, we conduct a study of empirical research on Kubernetes scheduling techniques and present a new taxonomy for Kubernetes scheduling. The challenges, future direction, and research opportunities are also discussed.", "venue": "ACM Computing Surveys", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-06-02", "journal": {"name": "ACM Computing Surveys", "pages": "1 - 37", "volume": "55"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "144891586", "name": "C.
