The study focuses on the capacitated vehicle routing problems. Density-based clustering algorithms were applied prior to resolving the capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) to reduce processing time and to maintain acceptable efficiency. The experimental results with 25 CVRP pipelines were compared. The results showed that the hierarchical density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (HDBSCAN) method achieved the highest performance. It could reduce the time of trip planning by 30-40% and total distance by 2.2% compared with the traditional method.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book"], "publicationDate": "2020-07-01", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Advances in Information Technology"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "50827268", "name": "Issaret Prachitmutita"}, {"authorId": "2358561", "name": "P.
