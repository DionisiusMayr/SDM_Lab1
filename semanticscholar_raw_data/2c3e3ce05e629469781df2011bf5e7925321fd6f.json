An online community-based ecosystem that enables peer-to-peer trade between buyers and sellers as well as share- and rental-based access to goods and services. Lack of trust and transparency is the main problem in the shared economy system. A blockchain-enabled architecture is created for the shared economy ecosystem to address this problem. In this study, product registration and product services policies are implemented using smart contracts. This technology aids in distinguishing between genuine and counterfeit goods while also giving consumers access to the product\u2019s metadata via QR codes. An experimental testbed that makes use of the polygon network is taken into consideration in order to validate the suggested framework.", "venue": "2023 First International Conference on Cyber Physical Systems, Power Electronics and Electric Vehicles (ICPEEV)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-09-28", "journal": {"name": "2023 First International Conference on Cyber Physical Systems, Power Electronics and Electric Vehicles (ICPEEV)", "pages": "1-6"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2244003250", "name": "Vikram Puri"}, {"authorId": "2136761976", "name": "V.
