Applied with a similarity network for clustering, this addresses a weakness of current supervised approaches to identifying individual birds which struggle to handle the introduction of new individuals to the population. Our approach uses object localisation to locate k\\=ak\\=a within images and then extracts local features that are invariant to rotation and scale. These features are matched between images with nearest neighbour matching techniques and mismatch removal to produce a similarity score for image match comparison. The results show that matches obtained via the image matching pipeline achieve high accuracy of true matches. We conclude that feature-based image matching could be used with a similarity network to provide a viable alternative to existing supervised approaches.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-01-17", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2301.06678"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1484613276", "name": "F.
