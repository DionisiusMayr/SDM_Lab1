With model databases already an ample collection of simulation models, including metainformation and source files, exists. In this paper, we bridge the gap between the information contained in model databases and the PROV-DM provenance standard, which allows making the diverse products and their relationships formally explicit. We present a procedure for creating PROV-DM graphs from model database entries, and illustrate the approach based on ten different models from the BioModels database. These case studies demonstrate the advantages of having a standardized provenance view in addition to the regular database entries, i.e., enhanced means for visualizing the structure of the simulation study and the curation process.", "venue": "Online World Conference on Soft Computing in Industrial Applications", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-12-11", "journal": {"name": "2022 Winter Simulation Conference (WSC)", "pages": "2118-2129"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "40912689", "name": "Pia Wilsdorf"}, {"authorId": "1743841", "name": "A.
