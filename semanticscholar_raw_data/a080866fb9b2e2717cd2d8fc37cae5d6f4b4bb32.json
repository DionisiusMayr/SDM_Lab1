To alleviate the shortage of bandwidth, some existing work has proposed traffic compression to reduce the amount of data transmitted over the network. However, their proposed traffic compression works in a coarse-grained manner at job level, leaving a large optimization space unexplored for further performance improvement. In this paper, we propose a flow-level traffic compression and scheduling system, called Swallow, to accelerate data-intensive applications. Specifically, we target on coflows, which is an elegant abstraction of parallel flows generated by big data jobs. With the objective of minimizing coflow completion time (CCT), we propose a heuristic algorithm called Fastest-Volume-Disposal-First (FVDV) and implement Swallow based on Spark. The results of both trace-driven simulations and real experiments show the superiority of our system, over existing algorithms. Swallow can reduce CCT and job completion time (JCT) by up to 1.47 \u00d7 and 1.66 \u00d7 on average, respectively, over the SEBF in Varys, one of the most efficient coflow scheduling algorithms so far. Moreover, with coflow compression, Swallow reduces data traffic by up to 48.41% on average.", "venue": "IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2018-05-21", "journal": {"name": "2018 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS)", "pages": "505-514"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1993679419", "name": "Qihua Zhou"}, {"authorId": "143667002", "name": "Peng Li"}, {"authorId": "28014924", "name": "Kun Wang"}, {"authorId": "2288376751", "name": "Deze Zeng"}, {"authorId": "144123438", "name": "Song Guo"}, {"authorId": "1697293", "name": "M.
