The observations have provided an unprecedented opportunity to better understand and respond to the spatiotemporal dynamics of the environment, urban settings, health and disease propagation, business decisions, and crisis and crime. Spatiotemporal event detection serves as a gateway to enable a better understanding by detecting events that represent the abnormal status of relevant phenomena. This paper reviews the literature for different sensing capabilities, spatiotemporal event extraction methods, and categories of applications for the detected events. The novelty of this review is to revisit the definition and requirements of event detection and to layout the overall workflow (from sensing and event extraction methods to the operations and decision-supporting processes based on the extracted events) as an agenda for future event detection research. Guidance is presented on the current challenges to this research agenda, and future directions are discussed for conducting spatiotemporal event detection in the era of big data, advanced sensing, and artificial intelligence.", "venue": "International Journal of Digital Earth", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2020-03-09", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Digital Earth", "pages": "1339 - 1365", "volume": "13"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2893304", "name": "Manzhu Yu"}, {"authorId": "1776835", "name": "M.
