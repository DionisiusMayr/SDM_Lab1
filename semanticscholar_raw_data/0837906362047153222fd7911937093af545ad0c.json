While these may seem at first glance to be very different topics, there are also important points of overlap. This paper lays out a taxonomy of event-based systems that shows where their commonalities and differences lie. It also highlights some of the key trade-offs that arise in the implementation of event-based systems, drawing both from distributed systems theory and from experience of their practical deployment. Finally, the paper outlines a number of open research problems in this field.", "venue": "Distributed Event-Based Systems", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle", "Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2021-06-28", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 15th ACM International Conference on Distributed and Event-based Systems"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3272157", "name": "Martin Kleppmann"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "d7e4983985eebfe539ac7a5785a184b228cc12af", "title": "The Good, the Bad, and the Outliers: A Testing Framework for Decision Optimization Model Learning"}, {"paperId": "c0a696c9b7d3fe3404e07db2b11f27ea4dd0cba1", "title": "Swim: A Runtime for Distributed Event-Driven Applications"}]}
