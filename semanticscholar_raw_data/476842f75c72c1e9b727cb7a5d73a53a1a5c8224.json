However, despite the increasing availability of applications that manage such data, little attention has been given to their structural features. In this paper, we propose specific metrics to describe the structural features of knowledge graphs. Such metrics are evaluated on linguistic data and our findings provide a ba-sis for a more efficient understanding of linguistic data.", "venue": "International Conference on Language, Data, and Knowledge", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "1721898", "name": "Blerina Spahiu"}, {"authorId": "51139967", "name": "Renzo Arturo Alva Principe"}, {"authorId": "2261394659", "name": "Andrea Maurino"}], "citations": []}
