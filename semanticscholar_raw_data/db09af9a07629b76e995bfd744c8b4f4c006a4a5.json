A challenge that arises is the efficient processing of analytical\u00a0queries extended with a similarity search predicate. These queries have a high computational cost since they require the\u00a0processing of costly star join operations and distance calculations in the same setting. We consider applications that\u00a0manage huge volumes of data, where the use of parallel and distributed data processing frameworks is needed. In this\u00a0article, we introduce two methods to efficiently solve this challenge in Spark. BrOmnImg is based on the integration of\u00a0the broadcast join and the Omni techniques for the processing of the star join operation and the distance calculations,\u00a0respectively. BrOmnImgCF extends BrOmnImg by using the conventional predicate to further reduce the number of\u00a0distance calculations. Compared with the closest method available in the literature, BrOmnImg reduced the time spent\u00a0on query processing by up to about 65%. Compared with BrOmnImg, BrOmnImgCF improved the performance by\u00a0up to about 54%.", "venue": "Journal of Information and Data Management", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-12-30", "journal": {"name": "J.
