While there are indications that these technologies can support vision care, a comprehensive understanding of the possibilities is lacking. Here, we review cross-disciplinary research on performing vision care, and identify current challenges for using and further developing ET technologies. To this end, we describe (1) the involved stakeholders, (2) screening possibilities at schools, and (3) how technology-supported vision screening is used today. Data come from a literature survey of peer-reviewed journal and conference articles, complemented by secondary sources from related projects and products. The focus is on literature after 2000, and in particular, on screening oculomotor dysfunctions (OMD), for school children. The results show that the contributions to state of the art from various research areas are fragmented, in particular regarding the communication between the necessary stakeholders influencing vision care, the handling of general and functional vision care, and between screening and treatment. Further development of ET technologies will likely depend on overcoming these fragmentations. A first step in this direction consists of providing a thorough description of stakeholders, their roles, and requirements enabling communication on children with vision problems.", "venue": "IEEE International Conference on Cognitive Infocommunications", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2020-09-23", "journal": {"name": "2020 11th IEEE International Conference on Cognitive Infocommunications (CogInfoCom)", "pages": "000471-000478"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2008210453", "name": "Qasim Ali"}, {"authorId": "2124792", "name": "I.
