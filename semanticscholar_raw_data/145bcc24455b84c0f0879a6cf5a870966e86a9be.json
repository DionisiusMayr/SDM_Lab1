There is an increasing number of publicly available geospatial Linked Data resources and they need to be interlinked and easily integrated with private and industrial Linked Data on the Web. The present paper introduces Geo-L, a system for discovery of RDF spatial links based on topological relations. Experiments show that the proposed system improves state-of-the-art spatial linking processes in terms of mapping-time and -accuracy, as well as concerning resources retrieval efficiency and robustness.", "venue": "", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2019-06-12", "journal": {"name": "arXiv: Databases", "volume": ""}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1413815091", "name": "Christian Zinke-Wehlmann"}, {"authorId": "35114918", "name": "Amit Kirschenbaum"}], "citations": []}
