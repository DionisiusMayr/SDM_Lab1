We have used a variety of models and techniques, including Transformers, hierarchical attention networks with multiple linguistic features, a dedicated early alert decision mechanism, and temporal modelling of emotions. We trained the models using additional training data that we collected and annotated thanks to expert psychologists. Our emotions-over-time model obtained the best results for the depression severity task in terms of ACR (and second best according to ADODL). For the self-harm detection task, our Transformer-based model obtained the best absolute result in terms of ERDE 5 and we ranked equal first in terms of speed and latency.", "venue": "Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"pages": "908-927"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "144607761", "name": "A.
