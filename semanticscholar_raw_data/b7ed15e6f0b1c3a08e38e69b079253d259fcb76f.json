Population growth, increased food consumption and the challenges of climate change will extend over the next decades. To deal with these, both regional and global measures are necessary. Biomass production and thus yield will need to be increased in a sustainable way. It is important to minimize the risks of yield loss even under more extreme environmental conditions, while making sure not to deplete or damage the available resources. Two measures are most important for this: irrigation and fertilization. While fertilization relies mainly on industrial goods, irrigation requires reliable water resources in the area that is being farmed, either from groundwater or surface water. Regarding surface water, a large portion of the world\u2019s fresh-water is linked to snowfall, snow storage and seasonal release of the water. All these components are subject to increased variability due to climate change and the", "venue": "International Conference on Extending Database Technology", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"pages": "749-756"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1914491", "name": "F.
