In the state of art, many clustering algorithms have been proposed. It is overwhelming the amount of biological data whose high-dimensional structure exceeds mostly current computational architectures. The computational time and memory consumption optimization actually become decisive factors in choosing clustering algorithms. We propose a clustering algorithm based on Non-negative Matrix Factorization and K-means to reduce data dimensionality but whilst preserving the biological context and prioritizing gene selection, and it is implemented within parallel GPU-based environments through the CUDA library. A well-known dataset is used in our tests and the quality of the results is measured through the Rand and Accuracy Index. The results show an increase in the acceleration of 6.22\u00d7 compared to the sequential version. The algorithm is competitive in the biological datasets analysis and it is invariant with respect to the classes number and the size of the gene expression matrix.", "venue": "De Computis", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-09-30", "journal": {"name": "Comput.", "pages": "106", "volume": "9"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1650030975", "name": "Ang\u00e9lica Alejandra Serrano Rubio"}, {"authorId": "1389981430", "name": "G.
