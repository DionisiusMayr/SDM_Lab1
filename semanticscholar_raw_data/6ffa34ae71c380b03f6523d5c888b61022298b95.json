The VISAGE (Visualization for Integrated Satellite, Airborne and Ground-based data Exploration) project is working to provide three-dimensional visualization and basic analytics capabilities for such datasets in an interactive user interface. The use of cloud-native, serverless technologies and analysis optimized data storage will position VISAGE for integration with other technologies into a Data Analytic Center Framework.", "venue": "IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2019-07-01", "journal": {"name": "IGARSS 2019 - 2019 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium", "pages": "5405-5408"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "144293546", "name": "H.
