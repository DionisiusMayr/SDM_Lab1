However, the arrival of big data and analytical methods presents an opportunity to better understand these disease entities. Areas covered: This review article highlights: (1) the potential of a big data approaches with emerging technology to explore the heterogeneity of CVDs; (2) current challenges of a big data approach; and (3) the future of precision cardiovascular medicine. Expert commentary: Overall, most of the current data utilizing big data techniques remain largely descriptive and retrospective. Precision medicine, or N-of-1, approaches have not yet allowed for consistent interpretation since there is no \u2018standard\u2019 of how to best apply treatment approaches in a field where evidence-based medicine is based largely on randomized controlled trials. The risk score and biomarker-based approaches have been utilized with some \u2018validation\u2019 studies, but more in-depth biomarkers (i.e. pharmacogenomic biomarkers) have failed to demonstrate incremental benefits. Exploring novel CVD phenotypes by integrating existing medical variables, multi-omics, lifestyle, and environmental data using artificial intelligence is vitally important and may allow us to digitize future clinical trials, potentially leading to novel therapies.", "venue": "Expert Review of Precision Medicine and Drug Development", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2018-09-03", "journal": {"name": "Expert Review of Precision Medicine and Drug Development", "pages": "305 - 317", "volume": "3"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "8633608", "name": "C.
