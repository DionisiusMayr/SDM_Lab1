In Quality Engineering and Management, product risk mitigation is a key objective. Especially for new products, risk identification is a creative action. In this paper, we present a quality domain-specific design thinking approach to product risk identification and subsequent quality requirements elicitation. The approach systematically guides product teams within four steps in identifying their product-specific quality requirements and associated risks using ideation methods. Implemented in the form of an open self-service kit for teams, it has been designed for scaling in large enterprises. We validate our approach in a large global automotive OEM environment including automotive mobile online services and products, financial services, as well as IT systems development. The key outcome of the work is a design thinking based requirements elicitation method for product quality risks, as well as an implementation in the form of a self-service kit.", "venue": "IEEE International Requirements Engineering Conference", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2020-08-01", "journal": {"name": "2020 IEEE 28th International Requirements Engineering Conference (RE)", "pages": "238-249"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2890503", "name": "Alexander Poth"}, {"authorId": "2310702", "name": "A.
