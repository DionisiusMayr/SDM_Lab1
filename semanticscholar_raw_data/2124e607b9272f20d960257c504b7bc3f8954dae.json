We apply MBDA for the \ufb01rst time for the detection and troubleshooting of network problems in a campus-wide Wi-Fi network. Data includes a seven-year trace (from 2012 to 2018) of the network\u2019s most recent activity, with approximately 3,000 distinct access points, 40,000 authenticated users, and 600,000 distinct Wi-Fi stations. This is the longest and largest Wi-Fi trace known to date. Furthermore, we propose a new feature-learning procedure that solves an inherent limitation in MBDA: the manual de\ufb01nition of the features. The extended MBDA results in a methodology that allows network analysts to identify problems and diagnose them, which are principal tasks to troubleshoot the network and optimize its performance. In the paper, we go through the entire work\ufb02ow of the approach, illustrating its application in detail and discussing processing times.", "venue": "Traffic Monitoring and Analysis", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "", "volume": ""}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2055058495", "name": "J.
