Spark employs a query optimizer, called Catalyst, to provides a set of optimization rules and supports Cost-Based Optimization (CBO). In this paper, we investigated the effectiveness of the optimization rules and costbasedoptimization in Catalyst. We conducted comprehensive validation experiments by varying the data volume and cluster scale, and found that the execution time of most TPC-H queries were reduced slightly even when query optimizations are applied. We derived some interesting observations on Catalyst, which can help the community better understand and improve the queryoptimizer of Spark in future.", "venue": "World Congress on Services", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2018-07-01", "journal": {"name": "2018 IEEE World Congress on Services (SERVICES)", "pages": "41-42"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1947949", "name": "Zujie Ren"}, {"authorId": "2074916956", "name": "Na Yun"}, {"authorId": "38737155", "name": "Weisong Shi"}, {"authorId": "49034115", "name": "Youhuizi Li"}, {"authorId": "145554360", "name": "Jian Wan"}, {"authorId": "2112566537", "name": "Lihua Yu"}, {"authorId": "2117801048", "name": "Xinxin Fan"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "8555ebe4545d9607298fb54a3dbc90bfbf8a403c", "title": "An efficient query optimization technique in big data using \u03c3-ANFIS load balancer and CaM-BW optimizer"}]}
