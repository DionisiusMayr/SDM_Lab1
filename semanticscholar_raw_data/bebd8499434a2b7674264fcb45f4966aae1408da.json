LogNNet has a feedforward network structure, but possesses the properties of reservoir neural networks. The input weight matrix, set by a recurrent logistic mapping, forms the kernels that transform the input space to the higher-dimensional feature space. The most effective recognition of a handwritten digit from MNIST-10 occurs under chaotic behavior of the logistic map. The correlation of classification accuracy with the value of the Lyapunov exponent was obtained. An advantage of LogNNet implementation on IoT devices is the significant savings in memory used. At the same time, LogNNet has a simple algorithm and performance indicators comparable to those of the best resource-efficient algorithms available at the moment. The presented network architecture uses an array of weights with a total memory size from 1 to 29 kB and achieves a classification accuracy of 80.3\u201396.3%. Memory is saved due to the processor, which sequentially calculates the required weight coefficients during the network operation using the analytical equation of the logistic mapping. The proposed neural network can be used in implementations of artificial intelligence based on constrained devices with limited memory, which are integral blocks for creating ambient intelligence in modern IoT environments. From a research perspective, LogNNet can contribute to the understanding of the fundamental issues of the influence of chaos on the behavior of reservoir-type neural networks.", "venue": "Electronics", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Physics"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-06-04", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2006.02824"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "49236496", "name": "A.
