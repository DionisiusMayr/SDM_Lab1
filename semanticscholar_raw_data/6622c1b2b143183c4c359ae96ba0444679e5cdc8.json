Spatial data mining is societally important having applications in public health, public safety, climate science, etc. For example, in epidemiology, spatial data mining helps to \ufb01nd areas with a high concentration of disease incidents to manage disease outbreaks. Computational methods are needed to discover spatial patterns since the volume and velocity of spatial data exceed the ability of human experts to analyze it. Spatial data has unique characteristics like spatial autocorrelation and spatial heterogeneity which violate the i.i.d (Independent and Identically Distributed) assumption of traditional statistic and data mining methods. Therefore, using traditional methods may miss patterns or may yield spurious patterns, which are costly in societal applications. Further, there are additional challenges such as MAUP (Modi\ufb01able Areal Unit Problem) as illustrated by a recent court case debating gerrymandering in elections. In this article, we discuss tools and computational methods of spatial data mining, focusing on the primary spatial pattern families: hotspot detection, colocation detection, spatial prediction, and spatial outlier detection. Hotspot detection methods use domain information to accurately model more active and high-density areas. Colocation detection methods \ufb01nd objects whose instances are in proximity to each other in a location. Spatial prediction approaches explicitly model the neighborhood relationship of locations to predict target variables from input features. Finally, spatial outlier detection methods \ufb01nd data that di\ufb00er from their neighbors. Lastly, we describe future research and trends in spatial data mining.", "venue": "Geographic Information Science & Technology Body of Knowledge", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2020-10-01", "journal": {"name": "Geographic Information Science & Technology Body of Knowledge"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "26366240", "name": "Jamal Golmohammadi"}, {"authorId": "46269169", "name": "Yiqun Xie"}, {"authorId": "152697699", "name": "Jayant Gupta"}, {"authorId": "1752816781", "name": "Majid Farhadloo"}, {"authorId": "89843190", "name": "Y.
