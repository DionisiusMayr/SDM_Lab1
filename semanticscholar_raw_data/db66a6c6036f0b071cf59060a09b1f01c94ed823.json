For a given query, the enumeration of logical plans \u2013 and in particular join enumeration \u2013 is an extensively researched topic. However, query operators such as union and recursion have been largely neglected in enumeration techniques. We propose an extension of the logical query DAG (LQDAG) used in modern query optimizers with the support of recursion, and develop appropriate techniques to enumerate recursive terms efficiently. Ou r LQ DAG extension is based on the fixpoint o perator r ecently i ntroduced i n the \ud835\udf07 -relational algebra. We show how to adapt transformation rules for individual fixpoint terms so that they can apply on a group of terms at once. The main benefit i s t o e nable a much more efficient ex ploration of re cursive qu ery pl an sp aces. We report on practical experiments with graph queries over real and synthetic graphs of varying size. Experimental results illustrate the benefits of exploring faster larger query execution plan spaces.", "venue": "", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "51040148", "name": "Amela Fejza"}], "citations": []}
