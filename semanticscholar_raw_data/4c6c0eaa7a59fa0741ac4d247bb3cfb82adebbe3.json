Thus, this phenomenological study uncovered the industry specialist's lived experiences employing in-depth interviews with purposefully selected industry experts as respondents. It has emerged three essential performance- related themes: generative process, competitive process, and preventive process. Musings, articulations, stories, reflections, and expressions of interviewees were transcribed from emic to etic and analyzed via cool to warm analysis. To ensure confidence of the results, the member's checking validation process was applied. The study revealed that the related factors that influence the performance of global industry were identified in ensuring structured and systematic implementation of the assurance management system for the critical asset. Stakeholders in the organization should focus on adopting the structured approach found in this study as the organization's guidance and best practices through the Cyclical of the Assurance Management System of Critical Asset (CAMSCA) process.", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2088506210", "name": "Joseph A.
