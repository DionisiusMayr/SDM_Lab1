E\ufffdcient delivery of resources considering user-dened Service Level Agreement (SLA) and Quality of Service (QoS) can only achieve with e\ufffdcient and state-of-the-art scheduling methods. In this regard, virtual machine (VM) scheduling has been a highly required method for resource scheduling in the ever-changing cloud and multi-access computing environment (MAC). Based on an examination of recent literature, this investigation intends to provide a comprehensive Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of the methods employed for virtual machine scheduling in cloud computing. Besides, the SLR disseminates the challenges and opportunities in VM design and discusses future researchers' baselines. The SLR investigated the VM scheduling techniques and searched the most relevant research databases online. The authors selected sixty-seven (67) preliminary studies for this review out of 722 articles between 2008 and 2022. A total of 67 articles were reviewed for VM scheduling methods and techniques. The taxonomical results were divided into three major classes; conventional approach, heuristics approach, and meta-heuristic approach. With the observation, this review concludes that a lot of development in VM scheduling techniques in the literature are based on metaheuristics and heuristics methods. At last, many open issues, challenges, and development trends of modern VM scheduling techniques are discussed.", "venue": "", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2249608065", "name": "Nadim Rana"}, {"authorId": "51480124", "name": "Fathe Jeribi"}, {"authorId": "2249642009", "name": "Sherif Taw\ufffdk"}, {"authorId": "2249641740", "name": "Amin"}, {"authorId": "2213149165", "name": "Zeba Khan"}], "citations": []}
