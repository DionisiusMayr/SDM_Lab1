The cooperations in this Framework Program give rise to a bipartite network with 72,745 network edges between 25,839 actors (representing organizations that include firms, universities, research organizations and public agencies) and 9,490 R&D projects. With this construction, participating actors are linked only through joint projects. In this paper we describe the community identification problem based on the concept of modularity, and use the recently introduced labelpropagation algorithm to identify communities in the network, and differentiate the identified communities by developing community-specific profiles using social network analysis and geographic visualization techniques. We expect the results to enrich our picture of the European Research Area by providing new insights into the global and local structures of R&D cooperation across Europe. * Accepted for publication in Geographical Analysis", "venue": "", "year": 2015, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2948124", "name": "J.
