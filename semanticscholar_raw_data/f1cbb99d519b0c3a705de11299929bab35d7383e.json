Our focus is on algorithms that estimate the size of maximum matching after each update while spending a small time. An important question studied extensively is the best approximation achievable via algorithms that only spend $\\text{poly}(\\log n)$ time per update, where $n$ is the number of vertices. The current best bound is a $(1/2+\\varepsilon_0)$-approximation for a small constant $\\varepsilon_0>0$, due to recent works of Behnezhad [SODA'23] ($\\varepsilon_0 \\sim 0.001$) and Bhattacharya, Kiss, Saranurak, Wajc [SODA'23] ($\\varepsilon_0 \\sim 0.006$) who broke the long-standing 1/2-approximation barrier. These works also showed that for any fixed $\\varepsilon>0$, the approximation can be further improved to $(2-\\sqrt{2}-\\varepsilon) \\sim .585$ for bipartite graphs, leaving a huge gap between general and bipartite graphs. In this work, we close this gap. We show that for any fixed $\\varepsilon>0$, a $(2-\\sqrt{2}-\\varepsilon)$ approximation can be maintained in $\\text{poly}(\\log n)$ time per update even in general graphs. Our techniques also lead to the same approximation for general graphs in two passes of the semi-streaming setting, removing a similar gap in that setting.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-07-17", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2307.08772"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2215877395", "name": "Amir Azarmehr"}, {"authorId": "8176576", "name": "Soheil Behnezhad"}, {"authorId": "71436953", "name": "M.
