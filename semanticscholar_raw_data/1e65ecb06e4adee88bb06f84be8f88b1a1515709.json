When all is said in done, atmosphere and rainfall are profoundly non-linear and confounded marvels, which require propelled PC demonstrating and recreation for their precise prediction. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) can be utilized to foresee the conduct of such nonlinear frameworks. Right now, huge information architecture for street trac prediction in enormous metropolitan regions is proposed. The practical attributes of the architecture, that permits preparing of information from different sources, for example, urban and between urban trac information streams and web based life, is explored. Moreover, its calculated plan utilizing best in class computing technologies is figured it out.", "venue": "2020 International Conference on Intelligent Engineering and Management (ICIEM)", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2020-06-01", "journal": {"name": "2020 International Conference on Intelligent Engineering and Management (ICIEM)", "pages": "306-310"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1860675355", "name": "M.
