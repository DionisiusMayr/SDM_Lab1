The Internet of Things (IoT) model has appeared as a crucial element for edge platforms. An IoT system has serious performance issues due to the enormous volume of data that many connected devices produce. Potential methods to increase resource consumption and responsive services\u2019 adaptability in an IoT system include edge-cloud computation and networking function virtualization (NFV) techniques. In the edge environment, there is a service combination of many IoT applications. The significant transmission latency impacts the functionality of the entire network in the IoT communication procedure because of the data communication among various service components. As a result, this research proposes a new optimization technique for IoT service element installation in edge-cloud-hybrid systems, namely the IoT-based Service Components Optimization Model (IoT-SCOM), with the decrease of transmission latency as the optimization aim. Additionally, this research creates the IoT-SCOM model and optimizes it to choose the best deployment option with the least assured delay. The experimental findings demonstrate that the IoT-SCOM approach has greater accuracy and effectiveness for the difficulty of data-intensive service element installation in the edge-cloud environment compared to the existing methods and the stochastic optimization technique.", "venue": "Electronics", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2023-01-28", "journal": {"name": "Electronics"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1410011411", "name": "Souvik Pal"}, {"authorId": "3218095", "name": "Noor Zaman Jhanjhi"}, {"authorId": "46228759", "name": "A.
