However, the current practice of banning such communities from mainstream platforms has unintended consequences: (i) the further radicalization of their members in fringe platforms where they migrate; and (ii) the spillover of harmful content from fringe back onto mainstream platforms. Here, in a large observational study on two banned subreddits, r/The_Donald and r/fatpeoplehate, we examine how factors associated with the RECRO radicalization framework relate to users\u2019 migration decisions. Specifically, we quantify how these factors affect users\u2019 decisions to post on fringe platforms and, for those who do, whether they continue posting on the mainstream platform. Our results show that individual-level factors, those relating to the behavior of users, are associated with the decision to post on the fringe platform. Whereas social-level factors, users\u2019 connection with the radical community, only affect the propensity to be coactive on both platforms. Overall, our findings pave the way for evidence-based moderation policies, as the decisions to migrate and remain coactive amplify unintended consequences of community bans.", "venue": "Web Science Conference", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Physics", "Mathematics"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book"], "publicationDate": "2022-12-09", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 15th ACM Web Science Conference 2023"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2057794776", "name": "Giuseppe Russo"}, {"authorId": "2164356774", "name": "Manoel Horta Ribeiro"}, {"authorId": "31796970", "name": "Giona Casiraghi"}, {"authorId": "51965804", "name": "Luca Verginer"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "43de11ef1ac04b3597a0a70011fd63ca3a05a972", "title": "Deplatforming Norm-Violating Influencers on Social Media Reduces Overall Online Attention Toward Them"}, {"paperId": "fb6b446fc31a78462e8d80e53d2266910a4df91f", "title": "Stranger Danger!
