Recognizing the diversity, cloud providers offer a rich selection of VMs with a large configuration space. The choice of cloud service can have a big impact on performance and cost. However, there are few guidelines given by the cloud providers. Choosing the right cloud service is difficult for users only with configuration information. Besides, there lacks a comparison between different cloud providers. To aid in the selection of VMs, we present CloudMeter, a tool to continuously run benchmarks on VMs of different cloud providers and grade each VM. With the grade, we recommend appropriate cloud service according to the requirement of cloud users. We also use CloudMeter to draw significant insights into cloud services among different cloud providers.", "venue": "2020 IEEE International Conference on Joint Cloud Computing", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2020-08-01", "journal": {"name": "2020 IEEE International Conference on Joint Cloud Computing", "pages": "48-54"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2068351108", "name": "Dian Jin"}, {"authorId": "2152885395", "name": "Yan Li"}, {"authorId": "1761268", "name": "Donggang Cao"}, {"authorId": "2057964662", "name": "Bo An"}], "citations": []}
