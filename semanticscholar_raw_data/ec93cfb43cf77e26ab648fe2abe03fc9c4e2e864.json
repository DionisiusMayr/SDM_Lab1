The stepwise regression algorithm is improved through GMDH-based optimization for selecting threshold values for significance levels, both for the inclusion and exclusion of voting function arguments. The voting function\u2019s arguments are formed using the positional method from branches of self-organizing trees and are supplemented by the forest\u2019s input arguments. Classification results obtained from the standard version of Random Forest, the self-organizing forest, and the proposed enhanced version of the decision tree forest are compared.", "venue": "International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technologies", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-10-19", "journal": {"name": "2023 IEEE 18th International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technologies (CSIT)", "pages": "1-4"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "134888272", "name": "Y.
