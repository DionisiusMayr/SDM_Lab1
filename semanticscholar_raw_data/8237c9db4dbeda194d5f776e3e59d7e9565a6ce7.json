EI-MS is a matrix effect-free technique that provides reproducible and comparable mass spectra, serving as a compound fingerprint for easy identification through automated comparison with spectral libraries. Leveraging EI-MS in biochemical studies can yield critical analytical benefits for targeted and untargeted analyses. However, to fully utilize EI-MS for heavy and non-volatile molecules, a new technology that enables the coupling of liquid chromatography with EI-MS is needed. Recent advancements in nanoLC have addressed the compatibility issues between LC and EI-MS, and innovative interfacing strategies such as Direct-EI, liquid electron ionization (LEI), and Cold-EI have extended the application of EI-MS beyond the determination of volatile organic molecules. This review provides an overview of the latest developments in nanoLC-EI-MS interfacing technologies, discussing their scope and limitations. Additionally, selected examples of nanoLC-EI-MS applications in the field of biochemical analysis are presented, highlighting the potential prospects and benefits that the establishment of this technique can bring to this field.", "venue": "International Journal of Molecular Sciences", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-07-01", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Molecular Sciences", "volume": "24"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2051341588", "name": "Natalia Gabrielly Pereira dos Santos"}, {"authorId": "11713171", "name": "E.
