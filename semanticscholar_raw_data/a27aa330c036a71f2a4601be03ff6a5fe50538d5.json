Regarding this, our previous work discussed a method to reduce I/O cost when processing OLAP queries with MapReduce. The method can be implemented simply by providing an SQL-to-MapReduce translator on top of the MapReduce framework and needs not modify the underlying framework. In this paper, we present techniques to translate SQL queries into corresponding MapReduce programs which support the method discussed in our previous work for I/O cost reduction.", "venue": "", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2017-06-30", "journal": {"name": "International journal of database theory and application", "pages": "61-70", "volume": "10"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2109894253", "name": "Hyeon Gyu Kim"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "6ba6c858122f5e14098af5c7faab3114264c00d5", "title": "Query Optimization: Fund Data Generation Applying NonClustered Indexing and MapReduced Data Cube Numerosity Reduction Method"}, {"paperId": "b5fff968d3b1a0e94bbdda71fc1a565478914b09", "title": "Multi-time Source Selection Optimization Algorithm for Time Synchronization System"}]}
