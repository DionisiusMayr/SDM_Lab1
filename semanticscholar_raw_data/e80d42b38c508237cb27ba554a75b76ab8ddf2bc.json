These systems create batch views (subsets of data) at the Serving Layer to speed up queries. This operation takes significant time. The article proposes a novel approach to lambda architecture implementation. A new method for Approximate Query Processing in a system with Lambda Architecture (LA-AQP) significantly reduces aggregate (sum, count, avg) calculation error. This is achieved by using a new way of calculating the reading segments probabilities. The developed method is compared with the modern Sapprox method for processing large distributed data. Experiments demonstrate that LA-AQP almost equals Sapprox in terms of volume and time characteristics. The introduced accuracy measures (\u03b4-accuracy and \u03b5-accuracy) are up to two times better than Sapprox for total aggregate calculation. Aggregate values can vary greatly from segment to segment. It is shown that in this case the LA-AQP method gives a small error in the total aggregate calculation in contrast", "venue": "International Conference on Internet of Things, Big Data and Security", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"pages": "253-261"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "40026683", "name": "A.
