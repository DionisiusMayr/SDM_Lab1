To enjoy ultrahigh resolution immersive VR video with wireless user equipments, such as head-mounted displays (HMDs), ultralow-latency viewport rendering, and data transmission are the core prerequisites, which could not be achieved without a huge bandwidth and superior processing capabilities. Besides, potentially very high energy consumption at the HMD may impede the rapid development of wireless panoramic VR video. Multiaccess edge computing (MEC) has emerged as a promising technology to reduce both the task processing latency and the energy consumption for HMD, while bandwidth-rich terahertz (THz) communication is expected to enable ultrahigh-speed wireless data transmission. In this article, we propose to minimize the long-term energy consumption of a THz wireless access-based MEC system for high quality immersive VR video services support by jointly optimizing the viewport rendering offloading and downlink transmit power control. Considering the time-varying nature of wireless channel conditions, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based approach to learn the optimal viewport rendering offloading and transmit power control policies and an asynchronous advantage actor\u2013critic (A3C)-based joint optimization algorithm is proposed. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm converges fast under different learning rates, and outperforms existing algorithms in terms of minimized energy consumption and maximized reward.", "venue": "IEEE Internet of Things Journal", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-06-18", "journal": {"name":
