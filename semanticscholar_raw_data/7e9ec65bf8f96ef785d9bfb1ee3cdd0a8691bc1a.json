In fact, we aim to virtualize the data stored in different NoSQL databases with a specific focus on document and column oriented databases types (considered as the most used ones) using Resource Description Framework (RDF) in order to contribute in the interoperability between applications that exchange data and process it as machine-understandable information, especially in the web application domain and offering more opportunities for novel services and applications that have such needs. In addition, our approach is very useful to carry out some operations that are not currently supported by NoSQL database systems, also to unify their heterogeneous data models. The proposed algorithms are based on a set of procedure and methods that we execute at each stage depend on the input file and as per the mapping rules that we already define. The obtained results via our application were encouraged and reflect exactly what has been expected and specified.", "venue": "", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2661245", "name": "Abdeljalil Boumlik"}, {"authorId": "26981542", "name": "N.
