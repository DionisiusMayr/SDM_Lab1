Effective ingestion of these sensing data into a storage subsystem while georeferencing phenotyping setups is key to providing timely access to scientists and modelers. In this study, we propose RADIX, a high-throughput distributed data ingestion framework with support for fine-grained georeferencing. Our methodology includes a novel spatial indexing scheme, the nested hash grid, for fine-grained georeferencing of data while conserving memory footprints and ensuring acceptable latency. We include empirical evaluations performed on a commodity machine cluster with up to 1TB of data. Our benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.", "venue": "2018 IEEE Intl Conf on Parallel & Distributed Processing with Applications, Ubiquitous Computing & Communications, Big Data & Cloud Computing, Social Computing & Networking, Sustainable Computing & Communications (ISPA/IUCC/BDCloud/SocialCom/SustainCom)", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2018-12-01", "journal": {"name": "2018 IEEE Intl Conf on Parallel & Distributed Processing with Applications, Ubiquitous Computing & Communications, Big Data & Cloud Computing, Social Computing & Networking, Sustainable Computing & Communications (ISPA/IUCC/BDCloud/SocialCom/SustainCom)", "pages": "1112-1119"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "145069202", "name": "S.
