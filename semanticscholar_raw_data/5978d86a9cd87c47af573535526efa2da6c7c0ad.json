The product of this thesis, EcoFlux, provides a new way for people to experience the inner working of ecosystems by using augmented or virtual reality to explore unseen ecological processes. EcoFlux builds on the existing MIT Media Lab project DoppelMarsh, which is a virtual landscape that changes in response to realtime environmental conditions captured by the distributed sensor network at the Tidmarsh wetland site. EcoFlux is the first of its kind to visualize models of molecular motion and carbon flow in 3D, within the context of the physical site, and driven by realtime data. Whether experienced remotely or integrated on site, EcoFlux can be used to inspire curiosity for visitors, enhance scientific understanding for researchers, and promote community development by demonstrating the value of ecological restoration. As environmental sensing becomes more ubiquitous in our daily lives, this thesis provides a foundation for harnessing human sensory systems to make meaning from abundant information.", "venue": "", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "", "volume": ""}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3530652", "name": "Sara E Remsen"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "0d3a11312a5bed1a89c2ebe10a3c1ad2d77a8127", "title": "Location-Based Augmented Reality In-situ Visualization Applied for Agricultural Fieldwork Navigation"}, {"paperId": "852fcc377cbe8d23b29987036f33ec1dd874e61e", "title": "The Networked Sensory Landscape: Capturing and Experiencing Ecological Change Across Scales"}]}
