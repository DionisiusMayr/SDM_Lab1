Geomasking methods have been developed to mitigate the risks by displacing spatial points before mapping. However, many of these methods rely on a weak privacy notion called spatial k-anonymity, which is insufficient to withstand the growing amount of spatial data (e.g. land use) that adversaries can use as side information to infer the actual locations of individuals. We proposes a method called geo-indistinguishable masking to address this issue by relying on a strong privacy notion called geo-indistinguishability. This notion ensures consistent levels of privacy protection regardless of any side information. The method consists of two steps. The first step involves creating a masking area for each spatial point to include a set of candidate locations to which the point can be relocated. In the second step, we formulate an optimization model to ensure the masked locations satisfy geo-indistinguishability while minimizing the distance displaced. Computational experiments on a synthetic dataset demonstrate that our proposed method is both efficient and effective in providing strong privacy protection while preserving the spatial point patterns.", "venue": "Cartography and Geographic Information Science", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-10-31", "journal": {"name": "Cartography and Geographic Information Science", "pages": "608 - 623", "volume": "50"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2254152038", "name": "Yue Lin"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "c482b922c7dddb7a23b5a6be28106e6966305552", "title": "Exploring the Tradeoff Between Privacy and Utility of Complete\u2010count Census Data Using a Multiobjective Optimization Approach"}, {"paperId": "449c811c8e022829170f5a42384ce220cd7c00a4", "title": "Moving beyond anonymity: Embracing a collective approach to location privacy in data-intensive geospatial analytics"}]}
