The adsorption kinetics is a curve that describes the rate retention to the adsorbate on the adsorbent at time, which is represents as a two-dimensional graph. In this paper, we present a computational application to determine the experimental conditions that influence when equilibrium point is reached into adsorption kinetics curve using the K-means clustering algorithm and, Parallel Coordinates concept, in order to prove our method we used adsorption kinetic curves Q-PVA . Results obtained were compared with two designs of experiments (three-stage nested design and hierarchical design with crossed factors).", "venue": "IEEE Latin America Transactions", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2020-09-28", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Latin America Transactions", "pages": "507-514", "volume": "19"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "72336479", "name": "Er\u00e9ndira Rend\u00f3n"}, {"authorId": "2578667", "name": "R.
