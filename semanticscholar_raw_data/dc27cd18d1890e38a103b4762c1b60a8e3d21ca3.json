Our innovative system encompasses an attribute-based access govern mechanism that combines a user\u2019s secret key with a lightweight safety device. Our system significantly improves security, particularly in scenarios where multiple users share a single computer for web-based cloud services, as access is contingent on the presence of both components. In addition, the attribute-based govern mechanism enables the cloud server to enforce access constraints based on users with identical attributes, while maintaining the highest extent of user confidentiality protection. The server\u2019s verification procedure focuses exclusively on verifying that users meet the necessitated criteria, without accessing their exact identities. To further confirm the practicability and usefulness of our 2FA system, we conduct an in-depth simulation as a portion of our study.", "venue": "E3S Web of Conferences", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "E3S Web of Conferences"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2278204263", "name": "P.
