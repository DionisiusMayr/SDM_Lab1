This trend is driven by an increase in volume and velocity of data that is being created and by companies seeking to unlock its potential. Examples include vehicle telemetry, health, and industrial data. At the same time, advances in hardware and machine learning enable system builders to create ever faster and smarter database systems. This thesis makes three contributions to the design and implementation of such systems. First, we compare main-memory databases with modern streaming systems using a telecommunications benchmark, identify performance and usability gaps, and explore extensions to database systems. These extensions include user-space networking for faster client-server communication and a scale-out architecture. Second, we propose an approach to processing geospatial point data in memory. In particular, we contribute a novel polygon index that allows for efficient point-polygon joins. This index can either provide precision-bounded approximate results or can be used to identify true and candidate join pairs. Most notably, it can learn from historical data to become more effective. Third, we contribute a new deep learning approach to cardinality estimation, which is the core problem in cost-based query optimization. We propose a new neural network model that can capture correlations between columns, even across tables. Trained with past queries, our model can predict the cardinalities of future queries and significantly enhances the quality of cardinality estimation.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2271173553", "name": "Andreas Kipf"}], "citations": []}
