Understanding the link between big data analytics and innovation", "abstract": "ABSTRACT This paper analyzes the relationship between firms' use of big data analytics and their innovative performance in terms of product innovations. Since big data technologies provide new data information practices, they create novel decision-making possibilities, which are widely believed to support firms' innovation process. Applying German firm-level data within a knowledge production function framework we find suggestive evidence that big data analytics is a relevant determinant for the likelihood of a firm becoming a product innovator as well as for the market success of product innovations. These results hold for the manufacturing as well as for the service sector but are contingent on firms' investment in IT-specific skills. Overall, the results support the view that big data analytics have the potential to enable innovation.", "venue": "Economics of Innovation and New Technology", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering", "Business", "Economics"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2018-07-17", "journal": {"name": "Economics of Innovation and New Technology", "pages": "296 - 316", "volume": "28"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "34883318", "name": "Thomas Niebel"}, {"authorId": "100900529", "name": "Fabienne Rasel"}, {"authorId": "101207432", "name": "Steffen Viete"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "1504d84c7d1c1c645874bf05dfe60e8682d2f389", "title": "Enhancing big data analytics deployment: uncovering stakeholder dynamics and balancing salience in project roles"}, {"paperId": "cb6fa80457c3df571939116bf4491bdce69110c6", "title": "Earth Observation data, innovation and economic performance: a study of the downstream sector in Italy"}, {"paperId": "15b814da56c19056da2157ce324cf025a99bc767", "title": "How big data analytics can create competitive advantage in high-stake decision forecasting?
