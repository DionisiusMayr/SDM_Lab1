In this study, six machine learning algorithms have been used to predict Mastitis in dairy cattle. The study has applied SVM, RandomTree, RandomForest, J4S, j4Sgraft, CSForest classification algorithms on a benchmark dataset of Mastitis on dairy cattle. To evaluate the performance of the algorithms, the study has relied on the four measures: Accuracy, True Positive Rate or detection rate, False Positive Diagnosis Rate (FPR) or False Alarm Rate (FAR) and F-measure. For the dairy cattle Mastitis detection data set, all the decision trees outperformed the SVM algorithm by scoring the perfect score (100%) based on the Accuracy, F-measure and Detection Rate and 0% in FAR scales. After applying the SMOTE technique, the performance of SVM has been improved in terms of accuracy from 85% to 94% and the FAR has been decreased from 70% to 5%. Moreover, the SVM performance has been improved in this study to the perfect score in all metrics by using the normalization technique.", "venue": "2022 8th International Conference on Contemporary Information Technology and Mathematics (ICCITM)", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-08-31", "journal": {"name": "2022 8th International Conference on Contemporary Information Technology and Mathematics (ICCITM)", "pages": "197-201"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2204382358", "name": "Ahmed Sami Mahmood"}, {"authorId": "1912492", "name": "Tarfa Hamed"}], "citations": []}
