By examining the benefits of BCT in various aspects of smart city systems, such as data security and privacy, the paper highlights the advantages of implementing consortium blockchain architecture and the Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus algorithm and discusses the challenges of scalability and security concerns. Based on the literature showed in this article, we believe that the use of BCT in smart governance could significantly enhance citizen participation and help manage and deliver public services, paving the way for more effective decision-making processes and improved quality of life for citizens.", "venue": "Open Research Europe", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-10-23", "journal": {"name": "Open Research Europe"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2209739153", "name": "Niccol\u00f2 Testi"}, {"authorId": "2261579978", "name": "Rebecca Marconi"}, {"authorId": "2261579208", "name": "Edna Pasher"}], "citations": []}
