It enables high-speed data transmission over a wide range and remains inexpensive. This is a point-to-multipoint wireless network technology that can also be used in other network applications such as wireless sensor networks. In this article, we will use MATLAB Simulink to analyze the MAC tier model on WiMAX. This MAC tier model can be used to evaluate WiMAX performance in multiple scenarios such as high data rates, modulation schemes, and channel conditions. The proposed simulation model has reduced simulation time and performance. In this analysis, various modulation techniques such as QPSK and QAM were used on the AWGN channel and the simulation results were compared by SNR and BER.", "venue": "2022 2nd International Conference on Technological Advancements in Computational Sciences (ICTACS)", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-10-10", "journal": {"name": "2022 2nd International Conference on Technological Advancements in Computational Sciences (ICTACS)", "pages": "658-662"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1824997", "name": "Mukesh Patidar"}, {"authorId": "4606687", "name": "Garima Bhardwaj"}, {"authorId": "2116747833", "name": "Ankit Jain"}, {"authorId": "2151823714", "name": "Bhasker Pant"}, {"authorId": "2181845785", "name": "Deepak Kumar Ray"}, {"authorId": "2198611688", "name": "Sandeep Sharma"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "91482c08d99cb466035a762e139215969339f2b3", "title": "Lung Cancer Diagnosis Using Artificial Neural Network with Different Optimizers"}, {"paperId": "02e4d3529c304c5a36d58a9f24c491b1989508f6", "title": "Application of Genetic Algorithms for Personalized Cancer Treatment Planning"}, {"paperId": "a374d356544064176b0e4abdddbc28a4ff235db4", "title": "Systematic Cognitive Computing Framework Application Using Medical Information Processing"}, {"paperId": "fdba1fa98ed1cc09bdfe7c9a3a69665203f25a1d", "title": "Artificial Intelligence-Based Control Strategies for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles"}, {"paperId": "9c06f8be95c066f03110981758f57f9da4c0f277", "title": "Convolutional Neural Network Application for Detection & Classification of Brain Tumour"}, {"paperId": "9ee63c6a6be18fa8a87fdcde6f763cc823668dfe", "title": "Detection of Emotion Employing Deep Learning Modelling Approach"}, {"paperId": "88977a327dfeab22ebecb29e78575d06756d5a54", "title": "Employee Absenteeism Prediction Using Machine Learning"}, {"paperId": "7495b1c39d7edce48dc787482fc080590558f723", "title": "Geographical Visitor Locator"}, {"paperId": "4d71317cb522b09b2d8fd31e1abec3856e2e49fe", "title": "AI and ML for Enhancing Crop Yield and Resource Efficiency in Agriculture"}, {"paperId": "f15117124be6a6a7ae31736fbb659f950b4dde4f", "title": "Object Detection in Images and Videos Using OpenCV: A Comparative Study of Deep Learning and Traditional Computer Vision Techniques"}, {"paperId": "b5c65242439cb77d497c90cef4abd6f54ec3fec7", "title": "Enhancing Network Security Algorithm Using Machine Learning"}, {"paperId": "f0a195df57e44ff6b941db282f355af95c1381d1", "title": "Stock Market Prediction using different Machine Learning Algorithms"}, {"paperId": "fa4a45d3f5462b341ec9252978567477100b3158", "title": "Weather Forecasting using Machine Learning"}, {"paperId": "6664374ae37fd178c9c07a74d69caef95c35064c", "title": "Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Robot Coordination and Cooperation in Manufacturing"}, {"paperId": "01e5ade8c147314000d905f16f21e4c47fc3e712", "title": "Artificial Intelligence Based Examination of the Field of Ophthalmology"}, {"paperId": "20e5c31cf088e53ca7ab63a1efc24e9640c5e6e8", "title": "Machine Learning Based Cardiovascular Detection Approach"}, {"paperId": "f44dc888d0a0f4af042315ede1e1c9881dd08295", "title": "AI & Lean Management Principles Based Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Processes"}, {"paperId": "e844675a5643f5149f0d0190e66eadce4240c13d", "title": "Deep Learning Approaches for Feature Extraction in Big Data Analytics"}, {"paperId": "24b796f091decb7b7a6536157d166735a1e9fdd4", "title": "Remote Sensing: A Comprehensive Overview of Principles and Applications"}, {"paperId": "ecec649ca9a930ed3ed6c1570923536c8477e485", "title": "Advance Electric vehicle System for Minimization of wiring Harness Using IoV"}, {"paperId": "8782f09915e22f58bdb8329340e9743b1a405d4a", "title": "On Scalability of FDD-Based Cell-Free Massive MIMO Framework"}, {"paperId": "a0c574e4de2cd071f75af9293f724f8530e4142e", "title": "Performance Analysis of Side Lobe Reduction for Smart Antenna Systems Using Genetic Algorithms (GA)"}, {"paperId": "175cbbc702e237df16931267115fa1a0668471c4", "title": "Optimizing Wiring Harness Minimization through Integration of Internet of Vehicles (IOV) and Internet of Things (IoT) with ESP-32 Module: A Schematic Circuit Approach"}]}
