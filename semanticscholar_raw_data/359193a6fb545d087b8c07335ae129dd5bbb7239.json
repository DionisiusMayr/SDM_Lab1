An automated detection of this behavior of extractors, which we refer to as split-correctness, would allow text analysis systems to devise query plans with parallel evaluation on segments for accelerating the processing of large documents. Other applications include the incremental evaluation on dynamic content, where re-evaluation of information extractors can be restricted to revised segments, and debugging, where developers of information extractors are informed about potential boundary crossing of different semantic components. We propose a new formal framework for split-correctness within the formalism of document spanners. Our preliminary analysis studies the complexity of split-correctness over regular spanners. We also discuss different variants of split-correctness, for instance, in the presence of black-box extractors with \"split constraints\".", "venue": "ACM SIGACT-SIGMOD-SIGART Symposium on Principles of Database Systems", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2018-10-08", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 38th ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGAI Symposium on Principles of Database Systems"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "35956810", "name": "J.
