In this demo, we develop a WCMR-based firefighter training system that provides firefighters with experiences in extreme and diverse fire accidents without any safety concerns. In such a system, it is important to ensure that all firefighters can see almost the same status of the fire accident to facilitate collaborative training. This is challenging due to the heterogeneous communication delays of different network users. We propose the latency compensation algorithm that determines when the edge server should transmit the message to users based on the estimated latency of each user. Our experiment demon-strates around 55% synchronization performance improvement while guaranteeing at least 60 frames per second (FPS).", "venue": "Conference on Computer Communications Workshops", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-05-20", "journal": {"name": "IEEE INFOCOM 2023 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)", "pages": "1-2"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2190450842", "name": "Zhanchen Dong"}, {"authorId": "2108313109", "name": "Jiangong Chen"}, {"authorId": "2156071930", "name": "Bin Li"}], "citations": []}
