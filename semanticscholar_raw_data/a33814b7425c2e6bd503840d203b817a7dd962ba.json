FL was designed for parametric models, namely Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Thus, it has shown promise on image and text tasks. However, FL for tabular data has received little attention. Tree-Based Models (TBMs) have been considered to perform better on tabular data and they are starting to see FL integrations. In this study, we benchmark federated TBMs and DNNs for horizontal FL, with varying data partitions, on 10 well-known tabular datasets. Our novel benchmark results indicates that current federated boosted TBMs perform better than federated DNNs in different data partitions. Furthermore, a federated XGBoost outperforms all other models. Lastly, we find that federated TBMs perform better than federated parametric models, even when increasing the number of clients significantly.", "venue": "International Conference on Fog and Mobile Edge Computing", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-09-18", "journal": {"name": "2023 Eighth International Conference on Fog and Mobile Edge Computing (FMEC)", "pages": "239-246"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2265678674", "name": "William Lindskog"}, {"authorId": "2265679180", "name": "Christian Prehofer"}], "citations": []}
