Then, a detailed analysis of each dimension is conducted, including the identification of resulting collaboration types. Next, collaboration enablers and the context influence are discussed, as well as their implications on the logistics system, with a specific focus on agri-food supply chains (AFSCs). Additionally, adequate key performance indicators (KPIs) are selected to evaluate collaboration outcomes. Finally, the horizontal logistics collaboration concept (HLCC) is applied to an illustrative case study from AFSCs.FindingsThe results show that HLC is a complex strategy where several elements intervene in the creation of the collaboration scenario. The research also shows that the specific characteristics of AFSCs influence the partners' selection process and increase the importance of partners' similarity and information exchange.Practical implicationsThe results provide managers with practical insights into the dynamic nature of HLC both at the operational and relational levels.Originality/valueThis paper provides a theoretical contribution by introducing a new comprehensive model for HLC and a practical typology that allows a deeper understanding of the mechanisms governing different HLC scenarios.", "venue": "Benchmarking : An International Journal", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2021-07-27", "journal": {"name": "Benchmarking: An International Journal"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "102460681", "name": "Ismail Badraoui"}, {"authorId": "1826837", "name": "Y.
