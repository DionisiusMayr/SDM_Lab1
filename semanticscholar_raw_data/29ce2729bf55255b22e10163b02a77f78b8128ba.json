In previous studies, researches for evaluating applicability in learning systems using data mining approaches are challenging to find. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the applicability of the proposed mobile learning framework. This framework consists of seven independent variables and their influencing factors. Initially, 1000 students and teachers were allowed to use the mobile learning system developed based on the proposed mobile learning framework. The authors implemented the system using Moodle mobile learning environment and used its transaction log file for evaluation. Transactional records that were generated due to various user activities with the facilities integrated into the system were extracted. These activities were classified under eight different features, i", "venue": "", "year": null, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "67047610", "name": "D.
