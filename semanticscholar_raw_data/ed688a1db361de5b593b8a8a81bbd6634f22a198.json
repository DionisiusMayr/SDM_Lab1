Considerable work has been carried out to improve and evaluate join approaches based on popular distributed processing systems such as Spark and Hadoop, however, it has not been widely studied on MPI. In this paper, we first implement, analyse and compare existing algorithms for the common small-large outer join operation and develop a novel approach, the swap-based outer join algorithm (SOJA). SOJA is designed to minimise the expensive communication between the distributed nodes while also reducing the cost of the local join operations. We demonstrate the benefits of SOJA experimentally, showing that it achieves at worst an execution time similar to its competitors. More importantly, SOJA requires substantially less memory (typically half the memory compared to the best competitor) and that memory usage scales very well.", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2087343695", "name": "Liang Liang"}, {"authorId": "2149520723", "name": "Guang Yang"}, {"authorId": "2323893", "name": "T.
