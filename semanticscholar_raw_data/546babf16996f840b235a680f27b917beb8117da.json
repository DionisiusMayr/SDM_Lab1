Therefore, medical diagnoses require fast identification and classification of organisms. Artificial Intelligence with deep learning (DL) can now be developed as a rapid bacterial classification. The research aims to combine deep learning and support vector machines (SVM). The ResNet-101 model of the DL algorithm extracted the image\u2019s features using transfer learning then classified by the SVM classifier. According to the experimental results, this model had 99.61% accuracy, 99.58% recall, 99.58% precision, and 99.97% specificity. The technique presented might enhance clinical decision-making.", "venue": "Indonesian Journal of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-04-01", "journal": {"name": "Indonesian Journal of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "9304262", "name": "S.
