Due to the fact that IoT encompasses a large range of significantly distinct environments, each of which merits their own survey, our survey focuses mainly on the smart home environment. Based on the papers surveyed, we pinpoint several challenges and open issues that have yet to be adequately addressed in the realm of IoT security research. Lastly, in order to address these open issues, we provide a list of future research directions on which we believe researchers should focus.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "9554551", "name": "Devkishen Sisodia"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "0a34553e157b427ab435a960274014d0c709c2a1", "title": "A Review of Security and Privacy Concerns in the Internet of Things (IoT)"}, {"paperId": "3c89654cfecf806d8258dc0adff31d9d4acbe37c", "title": "A Survey on the Applications of Blockchains in Security of IoT Systems"}, {"paperId": "37d359d132abc6f0289649b4362e3a9676bbab8f", "title": "The Applications of Blockchains in Addressing the Integration and Security of IoT Systems: A Survey"}, {"paperId": "909ec0a8fd521f99f854b19bd1264566f98484af", "title": "IoT Network Security: Requirements, Threats, and Countermeasures"}]}
