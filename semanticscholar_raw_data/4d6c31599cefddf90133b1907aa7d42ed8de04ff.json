Recent work on learned query optimization have shown that it is possible for a query optimizer to \u201clearn from its mistakes,\u201d correcting erroneous query plans the next time a plan is produced. Butwhatifqueryoptimizerscouldavoidmistakesentirely? Thispaperpresentstheideaoflearnedquerysuperoptimization. A new generation of query superoptimizers could autonomously experiment to discover optimal plans using exploration-driven algorithms, iterative Bayesian optimization, and program synthesis. While such superoptimizers will take significantly longer to optimize a given query, superoptimizers have the potential to massively accelerate a large number of important repetitive queries being executed on data systems today.", "venue": "", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2256525298", "name": "Ryan Marcus"}], "citations": []}
