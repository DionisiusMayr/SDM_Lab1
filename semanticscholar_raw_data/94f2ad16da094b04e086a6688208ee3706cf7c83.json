However, a significant concern of both the developer and user is about the security of these things. This literature review paper will mainly discuss security works and the importance of data privacy in the Internet of Things, as well as security attacks on some architecture in the Internet of Things devices. Furthermore, solutions that have been implemented in recent years from other studies will also be discussed. This mainly aims to better understand the structure and ways to protect and secure data for better privacy in IoT devices, as this would make more people trust and keep supporting the development of IoT technologies.", "venue": "2023 6th International Conference of Computer and Informatics Engineering (IC2IE)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-09-14", "journal": {"name": "2023 6th International Conference of Computer and Informatics Engineering (IC2IE)", "pages": "47-52"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2270714576", "name": "Karen Agustine"}, {"authorId": "2270723445", "name": "Devy Ivana Tati"}, {"authorId": "2270708043", "name": "Vivian Agatha Andrea"}, {"authorId": "29359625", "name": "M.
