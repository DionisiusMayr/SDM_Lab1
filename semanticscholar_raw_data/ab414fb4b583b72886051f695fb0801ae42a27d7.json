We investigate how a contest\u2019s reliance on crowd voting for winner selection, defined as the percentage of crowd-voted prizes to the total prize sum (in dollar amounts), affects contest participation. Drawing upon expectancy theory and tournament theory, we develop a theoretical understanding of this relationship. Using a novel dataset of contests employing both crowd voting and expert rating, we find that a contest\u2019s reliance on crowd voting is positively associated with participation. Specifically, every 10% increase in the crowd-voting reliance can boost users\u2019 odds of participation by about 7%. Moreover, crowd voting is more appealing to users whose expertise is not high and whose status in the crowdsourcing community is high.", "venue": "Journal of Management Information Systems", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-04-02", "journal": {"name": "Journal of Management Information Systems", "pages": "510 - 535", "volume": "37"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2146034649", "name": "Liang Chen"}, {"authorId": "2089818994", "name": "Pei Xu"}, {"authorId": "2119027196", "name": "De Liu"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "4391b01d6e3857309cf7b3b70217357d9a6d3ec5", "title": "A Comprehensive Examination of Digital Privacy in Crowdsourcing Applications"}, {"paperId": "5077a25db12b3609587f6d858b0b144ab6cfa3bb", "title": "What drives users\u2019 knowledge payment behaviour?
