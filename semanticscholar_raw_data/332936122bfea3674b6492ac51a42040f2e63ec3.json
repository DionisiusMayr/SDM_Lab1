It provides businesses with optimized production, personalization and improvement in the way production is dispersed. Nevertheless, conflicts arise in the use of these methods in certain industries, like retail items, which usually basis on large-scale production and prolonged supply chain. The study develops a theoretical structure to investigate if big data coupled with different production solutions can provide for a dispersed production system. Through investigation of twenty-one buyer products business instances applying secondary and main data, the study investigated changing production processes, the inherent catalyst, the function of analytics, and its effect on distributed production. The study discovers several uses of distributed manufacturing principles to evaluate the current production processes worked for larger customer product solutions by using analytics and industry analysis. The evaluation\u2019s suggested structure mentioned in this research has a deeper impact on planning, comprehension relationships, among factors of data analytics and distributed production.", "venue": "Journal of process management and new technologies", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-05-29", "journal": {"name": "Journal of process management and new technologies"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2165360940", "name": "M.
