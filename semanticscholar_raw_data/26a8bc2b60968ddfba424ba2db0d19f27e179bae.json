The aim of this paper is to contribute to a better understanding of the importance of vision screening for school-aged children, and to investigate the possibilities of how eye-tracking (ET) technologies can support this. While there are indications that these technologies can support vision screening, a broad understanding of how to apply them and by whom, and if it is possible to utilize them at schools, is lacking. We review interdisciplinary research on performing vision investigations, and discuss current challenges for technology support. The focus is on exploring the possibilities of ET technologies to better support screening and handling of vision disorders, especially by non-vision experts. The data orginate from a literature survey of peer-reviewed journals and conference articles complemented by secondary sources, following a rapid review methodology. We highlight current trends in supportive technologies for vision screening, and identify the involved stakeholders and the research studies that discuss how to develop more supportive ET technologies for vision screening and training by non-experts.", "venue": "Applied Sciences", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2021-10-17", "journal": {"name": "Applied Sciences"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2008210453", "name": "Qasim Ali"}, {"authorId": "2124792", "name": "I.
