Existing Von-Neumann-based ASM accelerators suffer from huge intermediate data with the ever-increasing string data, leading to massive off-chip data transmissions. This paper presents a novel ASM processing-in-memory (PIM) accelerator, namely ReSMA, based on ReCAM- and ReRAM-arrays to eliminate the off-chip data transmissions in ASM. We develop a novel ReCAM-friendly filter-and-filtering algorithm to process the q-grams filtering in ReCAM memory. We also design a new data mapping strategy and a new verification algorithm, which enables computing the edit distances totally in ReRAM crossbars for energy saving. Experimental results show that ReSMA outperforms the CPU-, GPU-, FPGA-, ASIC-, and PIM-based solutions by 268.7\u00d7, 38.6\u00d7, 20.9\u00d7, 707.8\u00d7, and 14.7\u00d7 in terms of performance, and 153.8\u00d7, 42.2\u00d7, 31.6\u00d7, 18.3\u00d7, and 5.3\u00d7 in terms of energy-saving, respectively.", "venue": "Design Automation Conference", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-07-10", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 59th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2008180541", "name": "Huize Li"}, {"authorId": "145914251", "name": "Hai Jin"}, {"authorId": "9135861", "name": "Long Zheng"}, {"authorId": "2108860901", "name": "Yu Huang"}, {"authorId": "144925807", "name": "Xiaofei Liao"}, {"authorId": "40975737", "name": "Zhuohui Duan"}, {"authorId": "2182623372", "name": "Dan Chen"}, {"authorId": "73767790", "name": "Chuangyi Gui"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "76eef89e0a05c4b67f19697e233916f4b3a77ff4", "title": "ASADI: Accelerating Sparse Attention Using Diagonal-based In-Situ Computing"}, {"paperId": "cf68cd9a6668ce1205a4bc3d4a8a969ef21c6a46", "title": "ASMCap: An Approximate String Matching Accelerator for Genome Sequence Analysis Based on Capacitive Content Addressable Memory"}]}
