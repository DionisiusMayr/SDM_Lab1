In this context, the article presents an initiative, called BIG-Bolet\u00edn Oficial del Estado (BOE), designed to process the Spanish official government gazette (BOE) with state-of-the-art processing engines, to reduce computation time and to offer additional speed up for big data analysts. The goal of including a big data infrastructure is to be able to process different BOE documents in parallel with specific analytics, to search for several issues in different documents. The application infrastructure processing engine is described from an architectural perspective and from performance, showing evidence on how this type of infrastructure improves the performance of different types of simple analytics as several machines cooperate.", "venue": "Big Data", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2018-06-01", "journal": {"name": "Big data", "pages": "\n          124-138\n        ", "volume": "6 2"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1398856686", "name": "P.
