The aim of this paper is to study urban ambient air quality data mining and visualisation. The concepts related to information visualisation, data mining and exponential smoothing methods are described. The architecture of the data mining system for urban ambient air quality in this paper is proposed. Taking city M as an example, an ambient air quality data warehouse is established and an exponential smoothing technique is used to design a prediction model. The exponential smoothing method was used to predict the medium and long-term ambient air quality in the ambient air quality data mining system. The experiments showed that the prediction model had good prediction accuracy.", "venue": "2022 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence of Things and Crowdsensing (AIoTCs)", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-10-01", "journal": {"name": "2022 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence of Things and Crowdsensing (AIoTCs)", "pages": "616-620"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2061746856", "name": "Linjie Lyu"}, {"authorId": "2215034654", "name": "Jingyi Kong"}, {"authorId": "2214971475", "name": "Yingyi Peng"}], "citations": []}
