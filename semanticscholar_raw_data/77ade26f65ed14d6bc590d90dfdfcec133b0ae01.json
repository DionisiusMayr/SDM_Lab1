Analyzing model performance on various subsets of the data is critical for fairness, trust, bias detection and explainablility. In this paper, we describe a new way to do this. Our solution, called InfoMoD, applies recent work in information-theoretic data summarization to the problem of model diagnostics. Using real-life datasets, we show how InfoMod concisely describes how a model performs across different subsets of the data and produces expected performance indicators for individual test instances.", "venue": "International Conference on Statistical and Scientific Database Management", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-07-10", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 35th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2056549500", "name": "Armin Esmaeilzadeh"}, {"authorId": "2285679188", "name": "Lukasz Golab"}, {"authorId": "1731110", "name": "K.
