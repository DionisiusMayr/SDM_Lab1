Hence, considering its efficiency, this paper proposes the novel cloud computing platform monitoring system based on N agios. N agios is a monitoring system that monitors system operation and network information. It can run on Linux and Unix platforms, and provides an optional browser-based Web interface to facilitate system administration. In the designed platform, the novel structure is considered to guarantee the efficiency of the model. Through the testing on the core code, the performance is tested.", "venue": "2023 3rd International Conference on Smart Data Intelligence (ICSMDI)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-03-01", "journal": {"name": "2023 3rd International Conference on Smart Data Intelligence (ICSMDI)", "pages": "169-172"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "48210927", "name": "Jia Liu"}, {"authorId": "2125029751", "name": "Chengzhang Qu"}, {"authorId": "2114111761", "name": "Tianhong Zhou"}], "citations": []}
