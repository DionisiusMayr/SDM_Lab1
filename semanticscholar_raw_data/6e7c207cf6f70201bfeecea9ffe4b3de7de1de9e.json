The collected knowledge is expressed by well-formed formula and in particular, OWL, a standard language of ontology, is a typical form of well-formed formula. The symbolic reasoning is actively being studied using large amounts of ontology data for extracting intrinsic information. However, most studies of this reasoning support the restricted rule expression based on Description Logic and they have limited applicability to the real world. Moreover, knowledge management for inaccurate information is required, since knowledge 114 \uc815\ubcf4\uacfc\ud559\ud68c\ub17c\ubb38\uc9c0 \uc81c45\uad8c \uc81c2\ud638(2018. 2) inferred from the wrong information will also generate more incorrect information based on the dependencies between the inference rules. Therefore, this paper suggests that the SWAT, knowledge management system should be combined with the SWRL (Semantic Web Rule Language) reasoning based on ATMS (Assumption-based Truth Maintenance System). Moreover, this system was constructed by combining with SWRL reasoning and ATMS for managing large ontology data based on the distributed In-memory framework. Based on this, the ATMS monitoring system allows users to easily detect and correct wrong knowledge. We used the LUBM (Lehigh University Benchmark) dataset for evaluating the suggested method which is managing the knowledge through the retraction of the wrong SWRL inference data on large data.", "venue": "", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2018-02-28", "journal": {"name": "", "pages": "113-125", "volume": "45"}, "authors": [], "citations": []}
