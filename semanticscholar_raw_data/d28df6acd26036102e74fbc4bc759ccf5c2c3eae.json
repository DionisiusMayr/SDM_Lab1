It is therefore crucial to have effective and efficient cross-database query processing capabilities. We present XDB, an efficient middleware system that runs cross-database analytics over existing DBMSes. In contrast to traditional query processing systems, XDB does not rely on any mediating execution engine to perform cross-database operations (e.g., joining data from two DBMSes). It delegates an entire query execution including cross-database operations to underlying DBMSes. At its core, it comprises an optimizer and a delegation engine: the optimizer rewrites cross-database queries into a delegation plan, which captures the semantics as well as the mechanics of a fully decentralized query execution; the delegation engine then deploys the plan to the underlying DBMSes via their declarative interfaces. Our experimental study based on the TPC-H benchmark data shows that XDB outperforms state-of-the-art systems (Garlic and Presto) by up to 6\u00d7 in terms of runtime and up to 3 orders of magnitude in terms of data transfer.", "venue": "IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-04-01", "journal": {"name": "2023 IEEE 39th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE)", "pages": "2794-2807"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "92265606", "name": "Haralampos Gavriilidis"}, {"authorId": "3091174", "name": "Kaustubh Beedkar"}, {"authorId": "1399355221", "name": "Jorge-Arnulfo Quian\u00e9-Ruiz"}, {"authorId": "1733290", "name": "V.
