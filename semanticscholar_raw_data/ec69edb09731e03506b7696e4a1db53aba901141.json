The rise of new kinds of data stores and processing, like NoSQL data stores, distributed file systems, and new data processing frameworks, brought new possibilities to meet this scenario\u2019s requirements. However, semantic, schema and storage heterogeneity, autonomy, and distributed processing are still among the main concerns when building data-driven applications. This work surveys the literature aiming at giving an overview of the state of the art of modern federated database systems. It presents the background, characterizes existing tools, depicts guidelines one should follow when creating solutions, and points out research challenges to consider in future work. This work gives fundamentals for researchers and practitioners in the area.", "venue": "International Conference on Enterprise Information Systems", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"pages": "276-283"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1785758", "name": "L.
