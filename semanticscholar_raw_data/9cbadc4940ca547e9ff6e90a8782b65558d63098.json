Artificial intelligence represents a new era within the field of gastroenterology, and the amount of research surrounding artificial intelligence in patients with inflammatory bowel disease is on the rise. As clinical trial outcomes and treatment targets evolve in inflammatory bowel disease, artificial intelligence may prove as a valuable tool for providing accurate, consistent, and reproducible evaluations of endoscopic appearance and histologic activity, thereby optimizing the diagnosis process and identifying disease severity. Furthermore, as the applications of artificial intelligence for inflammatory bowel disease continue to expand, they may present an ideal opportunity for improving disease management by predicting treatment response to biologic therapies and for refining the standard of care by setting the basis for future treatment personalization and cost reduction. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the unmet needs in the management of inflammatory bowel disease in clinical practice and how artificial intelligence tools can address these gaps to transform patient care.", "venue": "Intestinal Research", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-04-20", "journal": {"name": "Intestinal Research", "pages": "283 - 294", "volume": "21"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "49494435", "name": "H.
