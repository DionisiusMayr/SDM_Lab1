The idea of Bit-map algorithm is adopted in this algorithm. Specifically, it extracts and compresses the connection attributes of one of the tables to make a \u201cbackground\u201d data before executing the traditional RSJ algorithm. The algorithm uses DistributeCache to spread it to various nodes. The \u201cbackground\u201d data is able to filter out the information which is independent from the records in the table, therefore both the network communication and computation cost are decreased, which increases the efficiency of RSJ.", "venue": "2016 2nd International Conference on Cloud Computing and Internet of Things (CCIOT)", "year": 2016, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2016-10-01", "journal": {"name": "2016 2nd International Conference on Cloud Computing and Internet of Things (CCIOT)", "pages": "21-24"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2112870892", "name": "Shengchen Xiao"}, {"authorId": "2270146161", "name": "ShengqiYang Z"}, {"authorId": "2153098046", "name": "Jian He"}, {"authorId": "145750527", "name": "Zhangqin Huang"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "f920c4a7ac573464855123099298d91bc0252cf8", "title": "Performance evaluation and optimization of join operation in spark for big data processing"}]}
