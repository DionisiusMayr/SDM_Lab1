In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the number of internet-connected devices across various sectors. These devices include smart devices and sensors, which are utilized for data collection in diverse domains such as control systems, security measures, and healthcare applications which generate unstructured data. Consequently, the effective management of the IoT network necessitates the utilization of big data analytics. This investigation is meant to examine big data technologies and their various analytics platforms, as well as their significance within the IoT ecosystem through a comprehensive survey. This work aims to understand how big data analytics (BDA) and the IoT are related and the benefits of using platforms such as MAPR, Kaa, and Hadoop. Additionally, the study examines the requirements for analyzing big data in an IoT context. The research methods in this paper include comparing different approaches and platforms of BDA and IoT. The main finding is that security and privacy are major concerns when handling large amounts of data on the IoT.", "venue": "2023 3rd International Conference on Emerging Smart Technologies and Applications (eSmarTA)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-10-10", "journal": {"name": "2023 3rd International Conference on Emerging Smart Technologies and Applications (eSmarTA)", "pages": "1-15"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2264459152", "name": "Mohammed A.
