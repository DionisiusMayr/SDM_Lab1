In this circumstance, we demand a methodical approach that coordinates across the many organisational silos to save victims and cut down on losses when a crisis takes place. It is an imperative requirement that this solution has the capability to identify and localise problems that are occurring with certain components. Early on, the system would be triggered into action by alerts emanating from the places that were being affected. The next thing that the system will do is find out which of its components is most equipped to deal with the circumstance that is now going place.", "venue": "International Conference on Database Theory", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-05-11", "journal": {"name": "2023 International Conference on Disruptive Technologies (ICDT)", "pages": "301-305"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "102460869", "name": "Venkateswararao.
