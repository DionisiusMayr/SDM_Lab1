Firstly, expounds on the technical characteristics of LLM and knowledge graph; then structurally describe the simulation scenario related content, and build scenario knowledge graph; according to the characteristics of scenario aided generation, a simulation scenario generation method based on LLM is proposed, which uses prompt to fuse knowledge graph and LLM, next, the implementation steps of this method were elaborated; finally, the specific application proves that the method proposed in this paper is a good reference for the generation of simulation scenarios.", "venue": "2023 IEEE 7th Information Technology and Mechatronics Engineering Conference (ITOEC)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-09-15", "journal": {"name": "2023 IEEE 7th Information Technology and Mechatronics Engineering Conference (ITOEC)", "pages": "1350-1354", "volume": "7"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2264097133", "name": "Junfeng Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2263437972", "name": "Yang Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2221237498", "name": "Minnan Chu"}, {"authorId": "2264231968", "name": "Shun Yang"}, {"authorId": "2264164035", "name": "Taolei Zu"}], "citations": []}
