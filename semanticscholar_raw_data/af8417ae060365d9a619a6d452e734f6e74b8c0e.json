By exploiting blockchain\u2019s non-repudiation and non-tampering properties that enable trust, we develop a blockchain-based big data sharing framework to support various applications across resource-limited edges. In particular, we devise a number of novel resource-efficient techniques for the framework: (1) the PoC (Proof-of-Collaboration) based consensus mechanism with low computation complexity which is especially beneficial to the edge devices with low computation capacity, (2) the blockchain transaction filtering and offloading scheme that can significantly reduce the storage overhead, and (3) new types of blockchain transaction (i.e., Express Transaction) and block (i.e., Hollow Block) to enhance the communication efficiency. Extensive experiments are conducted and the results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposal.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2019-04-01", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems", "pages": "870-882", "volume": "30"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3431949", "name": "Chenhan Xu"}, {"authorId": "28014924", "name": "Kun Wang"}, {"authorId": "143667002", "name": "Peng Li"}, {"authorId": "144123438", "name": "Song Guo"}, {"authorId": "2889500", "name": "Jiangtao Luo"}, {"authorId": "3243858", "name": "Baoliu Ye"}, {"authorId": "1697293", "name": "M.
