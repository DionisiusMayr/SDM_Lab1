It was recognized early on that conventional error-correcting codes (ECCs), which are designed for soft errors, are a poor choice for addressing hard errors in NVMs. This led to the evolution of hard error correction schemes like dynamically replicated memory (DRM), error-correcting pointers (ECPs), SAFER, FREE-p, PAYG, and Zombie memory to improve NVM lifetime. Whereas these approaches made significant inroads in addressing hard errors and low memory lifetime in NVMs, overcoming the challenges of underutilization of error-correcting resources and/or implementation overhead (e.g., codec latency, hardware support) remain areas of active research and development. This article proposes error-correcting strings (ECSs) as a high-utilization, low-latency solution for hard error correction in single-/multi-/triple-level cell (SLC/MLC/TLC) NVMs. At its core, ECS adopts a base-offset approach to store pointers to the failed memory cells; in this work, base is the address of the first failed cell in a memory block and offsets are the distances between successive failed cells in that memory block. Unlike ECP, which uses fixed-length pointers, ECS uses variable-length offsets to point to the failed cells, thereby realizing more pointers to tolerate more hard errors per memory block. Further, this article proposes eXtended-ECS (XECS), a page-level error correction architecture, which employs dynamic on-demand ECS allocation and opportunistic pattern-based data compression to improve NVM lifetime by 2\u00d7 over ECP-6 for comparable overhead and negligible impact to system performance. Finally, this article demonstrates that ECS is a drop-in replacement for ECP to extend the lifetime of state-of-the-art ECP-based techniques like PAYG and Zombie memory; ECS is also compatible with MLC/TLC NVMs, where it complements drift-induced soft error reduction techniques like ECC and incomplete data mapping to simultaneously extend NVM lifetime.", "venue": "ACM Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization (TACO)", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2017-12-13", "journal": {"name": "ACM Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization (TACO)", "pages": "1 - 29", "volume": "14"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "13988650", "name": "S.
