However, due to lack of accurate semantic markups, finding relevant data is still difficult. To address this problem, we develop a one-stop dataset service called DataExpo and propose a deep learning method for automatic metadata ingestion. In this demo paper, we describe the system architecture, and how DataExpo facilitates dataset discovery, search and recommendation. Up till now, DataExpo has indexed over 960,000 datasets from more than 27,000 repositories in the context of Deep-time Digital Earth Program.
