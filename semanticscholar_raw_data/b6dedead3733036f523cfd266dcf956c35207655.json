Google TensorFlow ecosystem is one of the most famous and popular machine learning ecosystem. Because of some emerging technologies, such as big data, Internet of Things (IoT), high-performance computing (HPC), the power of datacenters are expected to be applied in Artificial Intelligence (AI) field. However, when performing ML tasks in datacenters, new challenges and issues arise, such as data management. Understanding the behaviors of the Google TensorFlow ecosystem is our main objective. We adopt the reference architecture method and extend our reference architecture created in our literature survey. We add additional deeper layers and identify more than 10 new components to enrich our reference architecture. Based on the reference architecture, we create a predictive model of Google TensorFlow and integrate it into a discrete event simulator OpenDC. We design simulation experiments to validate our model and evaluate the performance of the TensorFlow ecosystem in HPC environments.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2125355276", "name": "Wenchen Lai"}], "citations": []}
