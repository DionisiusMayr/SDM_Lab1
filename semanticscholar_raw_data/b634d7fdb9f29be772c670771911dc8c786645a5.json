In previous work we have explored language-integrated approaches to provenance in and . However, implementing a new form of provenance in a language-integrated way is still a major challenge. We propose a self-tracing transformation and trace analysis features that, together with existing techniques for type-directed generic programming, make it possible to define different forms of provenance as user code. We present our design as an extension to a core language for Links called TLinks, give examples showing its capabilities, and outline its metatheory and key correctness properties.", "venue": "International Workshop/Symposium on Database Programming Languages", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book"], "publicationDate": "2019-05-06", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 17th ACM SIGPLAN International Symposium on Database Programming Languages"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "31538148", "name": "Stefan Fehrenbach"}, {"authorId": "144320476", "name": "J.
