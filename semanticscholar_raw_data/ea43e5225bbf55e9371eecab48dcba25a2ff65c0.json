The e-commerce resources and dynamic capabilities of SMEs were analysed to explore the impact they have on the growth of e-commerce.\n\u00a0\nMethodology: Purposive sampling was used to identify 13 participants (SME owners/managers) for a qualitative study conducted using semi-structured interviews to gain an in-depth understanding of the challenges which impacted their business and marketing model. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the transcripts from the interviews and identify any patterns.\n\u00a0\nFindings: It was ascertained that the pandemic stimulated the growth of e-commerce among SMEs that invested in unique resources and capabilities. However, those businesses that had not invested in on-line marketing resources were negatively affected and some have had to close.\n\u00a0\nPractical implications: The practical implication of this research relates to how SMEs could (should) smartly digitise their business model and migrate to e-commerce more effectively and efficiently.\n\u00a0\nValue: This study may assist SMEs to make more informed decisions when using e-commerce platforms. The findings may also contribute to preparing South African SMEs to adapt more easily, should a similar disruption occur in the future.", "venue": "International Journal of Professional Business Review", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-08-09", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Professional Business Review"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2231408786", "name": "Atlanta Ramsern"}, {"authorId": "2221971835", "name": "Krishna Kistan Govender"}], "citations": []}
