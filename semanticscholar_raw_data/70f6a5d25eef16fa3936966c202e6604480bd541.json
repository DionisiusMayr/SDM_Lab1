Traditionally, this is achieved through re-execution or replication. However, both techniques come with significant overheads, in particular when cold-start effects are considered. Such effects occur after replicas resume from checkpoints or from their initial state. This work aims at improving on the performance of control-task replication by leveraging an inherent stability of many plants to tolerate occasional control-task deadline misses and suggests masking faults just with a detection quorum. To make this possible, we have to eliminate cold-start effects to allow replicas to rejuvenate during each control cycle. We do so, by systematically turning stateful controllers into instants that can be recovered in a stateless manner. We highlight the mechanisms behind this transformation, how it achieves consensual resilient control, and demonstrate on the example of an inverted pendulum how accidental and maliciously-induced faults can be absorbed, even if control tasks run in less predictable environments", "venue": "Euromicro Conference on Real-Time Systems", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"pages": "14:1-14:27"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "47562496", "name": "A.
