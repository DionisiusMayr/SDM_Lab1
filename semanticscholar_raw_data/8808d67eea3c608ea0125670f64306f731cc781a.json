They allow developers to write code flexibly while assuming a new database schema different from the current one. The co-evolution of the schema with the software code, together with requirements for performance and cost efficiency, require subtle management decisions regarding the migration of variational legacy data persisted in the production database. Project managers have to deal with the consequences of schema evolution in order to comply with service-level agreements, especially if metrics specified in the SLAs compete with each other in tradeoffs. We present self-adaptive schema migration strategies that curate just as much variational data so that competing metrics can be balanced out, thus making continuous management interventions superfluous.", "venue": "International Conference on Model-Driven Engineering and Software Development", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"pages": "279-286"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "146088215", "name": "Andrea Hillenbrand"}, {"authorId": "1710463", "name": "U.
