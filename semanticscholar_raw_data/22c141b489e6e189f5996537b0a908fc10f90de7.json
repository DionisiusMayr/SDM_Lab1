As a safety-critical system, the rapid response from the health care system is extremely important. To fulfill the low latency requirement, fog computing is a competitive solution by deploying healthcare IoT devices on the edge of clouds. However, these fog devices generate huge amount of sensor data. Designing a specific framework for fog devices to ensure reliable data transmission and rapid data processing becomes a topic of utmost significance. In this paper, a Reduced Variable Neighborhood Search (RVNS)-based sEnsor Data Processing Framework (REDPF) is proposed to enhance reliability of data transmission and processing speed. Functionalities of REDPF include fault-tolerant data transmission, self-adaptive filtering and data-load-reduction processing. Specifically, a reliable transmission mechanism, managed by a self-adaptive filter, will recollect lost or inaccurate data automatically. Then, a new scheme is designed to evaluate the health status of the elderly people. Through extensive simulations, we show that our proposed scheme improves network reliability, and provides a faster processing speed.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-01-01", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering", "pages": "263-273", "volume": "7"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "28014924", "name": "Kun Wang"}, {"authorId": "2112573464", "name": "Yun Shao"}, {"authorId": "144206960", "name": "Lei Xie"}, {"authorId": "39006765", "name": "Jie Wu"}, {"authorId": "144123438", "name": "Song Guo"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "a0e425c967f81f30cfcc8b2cd2d8016074ced792", "title": "PriorHealth: A Priority-Aware Task Scheduling Framework for Managing Healthcare Data in Fog Computing Applications"}, {"paperId": "f7ef1379f72b76694e7628c1f650115ae61552d1", "title": "Intelligent Task Scheduling Approach for IoT Integrated Healthcare Cyber Physical Systems"}, {"paperId": "a035f321f24b9fc33d0ba1fe9c79d9d698be9526", "title": "Content Replica Placement Method for Fault Tolerance in Fog Computing Environment"}, {"paperId": "00bc2d623245c84d7cc599ee79a1d751f683a1a3", "title": "Development of an Innovative Optimal Route Selection Model Based on an Improved Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (IMOGA) Method in IoT Healthcare"}, {"paperId": "f4af0b913ddce4123a60d5e93fa8541c51d9d19c", "title": "An Efficient Approach for Secured Data Transmission Between IoT and Cloud"}, {"paperId": "f1bf937a34a0f62ee6b1731c398cef32140b2f19", "title": "Can Embedded Real-Time Linux System Effectively Support Multipath Transmission?
