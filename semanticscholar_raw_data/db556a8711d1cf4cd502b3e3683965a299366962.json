The algorithm is improved on the deep learning recommendation algorithm named Wide & Deep Learning (WDL), which is a CTR (Click\u2010through rate prediction) prediction algorithm. MMF (Multi\u2010level Fusion Feature) uses collaborative filtering to replace linear methods in the wide part of WDL, introduces feature interactions to model user representations and item representations separately, and uses ResNet (Residual Network) ideas to improve deep neural network (DNN) in the deep part to reduce the performance degradation caused by overfitting. The experimental validation was conducted on the online education data set and the public data set MovieLens\u20101M, and the AUC was improved by 1.21% and 1.46%, respectively. Meanwhile, the effect brought by this improved algorithm is interpretable.", "venue": "Computer Applications in Engineering Education", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-12-10", "journal": {"name": "Computer Applications in Engineering Education", "pages": "469 - 479", "volume": "31"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "47196186", "name": "Zhenhai Wang"}, {"authorId": "2205249632", "name": "Zhiru Wang"}, {"authorId": "2195205342", "name": "Yuhao Xu"}, {"authorId": "2189590384", "name": "Xing Wang"}, {"authorId": "1471697285", "name": "Hongyu Tian"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "0a642ac0c17ed8e6880476248967bf344d493afc", "title": "Robust enhanced collaborative filtering without explicit noise filtering"}, {"paperId": "c9ba7139077bb4838f6402bc09dd74a8cb028f38", "title": "A novel cascaded multi-task method for crop prescription recommendation based on electronic medical record"}, {"paperId": "f54faf827b5ccd529bd602659f607db6560dfb85", "title": "Adaptive Learning Using Artificial Intelligence in e-Learning: A Literature Review"}]}
