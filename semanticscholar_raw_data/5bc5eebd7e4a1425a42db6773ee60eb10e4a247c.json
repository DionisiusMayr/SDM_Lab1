It is made up of various techniques such as data extraction, data scavenging, prediction and machine learning too. Predictive analysis is used in both business and education sectors. The target of this paper is to provide relevant and state of the art work done in this field. Main facets of various feature selection approaches and different algorithms for selection are explained with their applications. Most referred papers are provided below in the form of a table with the technology used in them and their advantages, disadvantages, accuracy. This paper provides ample and in-depth information to everyone who is interested to use predictive analysis in education sector.", "venue": "2023 IEEE IAS Global Conference on Emerging Technologies (GlobConET)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-05-19", "journal": {"name": "2023 IEEE IAS Global Conference on Emerging Technologies (GlobConET)", "pages": "1-7"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1961704745", "name": "Deepti Aggarwal"}, {"authorId": "2220183657", "name": "Raghav Singh"}, {"authorId": "2091846271", "name": "Priyanshu Jain"}, {"authorId": "2220169636", "name": "Mayank Rajput"}, {"authorId": "2220166940", "name": "Vishnu Tygai"}], "citations": []}
