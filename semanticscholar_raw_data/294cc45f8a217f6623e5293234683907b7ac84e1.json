This problem becomes more complicated when the database is replicated on multiple nodes. There have been divergent design index tuning algorithms utilizing either heuristic or optimization methods to solve this NP-Hard problem. However, this index selection problem becomes much more complex for large-scale replicated database applications and efficient algorithms are needed. While quantum computing has been investigated with promising results in several areas of database management, such as query optimization and transaction scheduling, no work exists that studies the divergent design index tuning problem for replicated databases. To fill this gap, in this paper, we provide our vision of a machine learning-based quantum divergent design index tuning algorithm for replicated databases. We first discuss the issues that should be handled when designing such an algorithm. We then describe an algorithm for classical computers that has been shown to perform better than other existing algorithms and present our vision of how to transform the algorithm to its quantum version.", "venue": "VLDB Workshops", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "144099017", "name": "L.
