In this note, we propose an improved K-means clustering approach called \u2018enhanced shrinkage K-means\u2019 based on the James-Stein estimator and learning vector quantization (LVQ) algorithm. The basic idea of this new algorithm is taking into account of the strength of both unsupervised clustering and supervised classification methods, in which we shrink the clustering centers toward the prototype vector via James-Stein estimator. We carry out extensive simulation studies and real data analysis to evaluate the performance of this new approach, and obtain encouraging results.", "venue": "Communications in statistics.
