That produced the term big data. Many companies are interested in analyzing this data, which amounts to several terabytes. The term distributed computing system appears as an effective technique for analyzing big data. Businesses have sought to use cloud resources to implement distributed computing in order to reduce costs and increase productivity. Distributed computing system faces the hurdle of significant material cost for providing related equipment. To avoid the financial cost problem, researchers have developed frameworks and tools for implementing distributed computing operations by using the redundant resources of cloud computing. This paper presents the advantages and disadvantages of a distributed computing system as well as analyzes traditional systems of distributed computing and concludes with a survey of frameworks for using cloud computing resources to implement distributed computing system operations at a lower cost.", "venue": "2020 International Conference on Data Analytics for Business and Industry: Way Towards a Sustainable Economy (ICDABI)", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2020-10-26", "journal": {"name": "2020 International Conference on Data Analytics for Business and Industry: Way Towards a Sustainable Economy (ICDABI)", "pages": "1-6"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "48338729", "name": "A.
