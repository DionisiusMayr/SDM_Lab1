Among the vast amount of MBD research results, despite the bibliometric analysis, it does not provide readers with a comprehensive understanding of the cutting-edge trends and developments in MBD research due to the small amount of data and poor timeliness. Therefore, based on the 3353 publications retrieved from Web of Science between 2002 and 2022, this paper performed quantitative, various kinds of cooperative networks, clustering networks, keywords, frontier trends and main path analysis. The conclusions are as follows. (1) MBD research findings are increasing at an even higher rate. (2) Research contribution differs widely between countries and institutions, and is relatively average between authors and journals. (3) MBD research frontiers show a tendency to span a wide range of disciplines and to be strongly associated with Internet technologies. (4) According to the results of the main path analysis, health IoT and medical big data are the hot spots for MBD research.", "venue": "BDE", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-05-26", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Big Data Engineering"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "144666089", "name": "Wei Zhou"}, {"authorId": "2109667584", "name": "Zhaoxia Wu"}, {"authorId": "153018840", "name": "Yi-zhao Xu"}], "citations": []}
