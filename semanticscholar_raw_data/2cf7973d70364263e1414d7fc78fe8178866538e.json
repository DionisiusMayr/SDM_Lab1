Literature so far has largely focused on individual application scenarios of INC, leaving aside the problem of coordinating usage of potentially scarce and heterogeneous switch resources among multiple INC scenarios, applications, and users. Alas, the traditional model of resource pools of isolated compute containers does not fit an INC-enabled data center. This paper describes HIRE, a holistic INC-aware resource manager which allows for server-local and INC resources to be coordinated in unison. HIRE introduces a novel flexible resource (meta-)model to address heterogeneity and resource interchangeability, and includes two approaches for INC scheduling: (a) retrofitting existing schedulers; (b) designing a new one. For (a), HIRE presents a retrofitting API and demonstrates it with four state-of-the-art schedulers. For (b), HIRE proposes a flow-based scheduler, cast as a min-cost max-flow problem, where a unified cost model is used to integrate the different costs. Experiments with a workload trace of a 4000 machine cluster show that HIRE makes better use of INC resources by serving 8\u201330% more INC requests, while simultaneously reducing network detours by 20% and reducing tail placement latency by 50%.", "venue": "IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-12-01", "journal": {"name": "IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking", "pages": "2448-2463", "volume": "30"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2167983043", "name": "Marcel Blocher"}, {"authorId": "46660076", "name": "L.
