However, data security remains a significant challenge for cultural entities such as libraries and museums, as hackers can target database systems and gain access to sensitive information. This study examines the benefits and security issues associated with big data analytics and proposes a manual approach for analyzing data with application to digital presentation and preservation of cultural heritage.
