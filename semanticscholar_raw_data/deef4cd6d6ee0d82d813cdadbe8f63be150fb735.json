Sometimes such a huge amount of data cannot be processed in time, and people cannot dig out useful information from it. In order to realize the efficient processing of massive data, this paper develops a big data real-time processing architecture based on the Hadoop platform, uses HBase as the database, and combines the C# programming language and the MapReduce programming mode to design a big data processing system, so that users can view and upload data through mobile devices. The data processing results of the cloud computing center. The performance test of MapReduce and various functional modules of the big data processing architecture is carried out. The test results show that MapReduce has certain advantages in processing big data, and the data processing time of each functional module increases with the increase of data volume.", "venue": "International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Virtual Reality, and Visualization", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-03-01", "journal": {"pages": "125880O - 125880O-6", "volume": "12588"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2112403446", "name": "Yong Cao"}], "citations": []}
