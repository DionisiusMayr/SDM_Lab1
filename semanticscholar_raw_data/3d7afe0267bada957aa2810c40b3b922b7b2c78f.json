This research reviews the fundamental components and characteristics included in analytic systems for effectively managing big spatial data. After that, an overview of recent researches on big spatial data is discussed using four main components: source, storage, processing, and visualization. The components are then described in detail, including examples of how they are used in existing work. Afterward, some researchers\u2019 work on systems of big spatial data is discussed showing how they support these four components. Furthermore, a comparison between these works is given in terms of the important performance metrics. Finally, this paper addresses the future research directions.", "venue": "2022 5th International Conference on Engineering Technology and its Applications (IICETA)", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-05-31", "journal": {"name": "2022 5th International Conference on Engineering Technology and its Applications (IICETA)", "pages": "147-152"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2137250014", "name": "Noor Alsaedi"}, {"authorId": "3344465", "name": "A.
