However, most applications are written using bulk-synchronous programming models, which may not be optimal for irregular algorithms that benefit from low-latency, asynchronous communication. This article proposes constructs for asynchronous multi-GPU programming and describes their implementation in a thin runtime environment called Groute. Groute also implements common collective operations and distributed work-lists, enabling the development of irregular applications without substantial programming effort. We demonstrate that this approach achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits strong scaling for a suite of irregular applications on eight-GPU and heterogeneous systems, yielding over 7\u00d7 speedup for some algorithms.", "venue": "ACM Transactions on Parallel Computing", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-06-20", "journal": {"name": "ACM Transactions on Parallel Computing (TOPC)", "pages": "1 - 27", "volume": "7"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1402921119", "name": "Tal Ben-Nun"}, {"authorId": "119223595", "name": "M.
