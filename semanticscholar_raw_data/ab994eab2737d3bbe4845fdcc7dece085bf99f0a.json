These systems are executed on top of a managed runtime such as the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which requires each data item to be represented as an object before it can be processed. This representation is the direct cause of many kinds of severe inefficiencies. We developed Gerenuk, a compiler and runtime that aims to enable a JVM-based data-parallel system to achieve near-native efficiency by transforming a set of statements in the system for direct execution over inlined native bytes. The key insight leading to Gerenuk's success is two-fold: (1) analytics workloads often use immutable and confined data types. If we speculatively optimize the system and user code with this assumption, the transformation can be made tractable. (2) The flow of data starts at a deserialization point where objects are created from a sequence of native bytes and ends at a serialization point where they are turned back into a byte sequence to be sent to the disk or network. This flow naturally defines a speculative execution region (SER) to be transformed. Gerenuk compiles a SER speculatively into a version that can operate directly over native bytes that come from the disk or network. The Gerenuk runtime aborts the SER execution upon violations of the immutability and confinement assumption and switches to the slow path by deserializing the bytes and re-executing the original SER. Our evaluation on Spark and Hadoop demonstrates promising results.", "venue": "Symposium on Operating Systems Principles", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2019-10-27", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 27th ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "40462662", "name": "Christian Navasca"}, {"authorId": "1612906643", "name": "Cheng Cai"}, {"authorId": "2055541087", "name": "Khanh Nguyen"}, {"authorId": "1707313", "name": "Brian Demsky"}, {"authorId": "144134982", "name": "Shan Lu"}, {"authorId": "35710133", "name": "Miryung Kim"}, {"authorId": "38394648", "name": "G.
