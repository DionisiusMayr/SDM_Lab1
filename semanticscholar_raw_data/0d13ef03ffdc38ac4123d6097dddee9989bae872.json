Thus, a deep active learning method with a new query strategy is proposed in this implementation for sport type recognition from images. As the rate of data generated by social media applications is needed powerful data handling mechanism. The big data generated by this application gets difficult to categories data by content basis. But currently the scenario is that there is not sufficient content aware data classification available. The existing work is totally based on tag and meta data based classification which leads data conflicts. To overcome this problem we are going to invent sport video based data classification system.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2020-04-01", "journal": {"name": "Journal of emerging technologies and innovative research", "volume": ""}, "authors": [{"authorId": "144552536", "name": "S.
