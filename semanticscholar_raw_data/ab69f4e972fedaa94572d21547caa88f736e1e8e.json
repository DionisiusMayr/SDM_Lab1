Under the managed runtime, when performing data transfer across machines, a task frequently conducted in a Big Data system, the system needs to serialize a sea of objects into a byte sequence before sending them over the network. The remote node receiving the bytes then deserializes them back into objects. This process is both performance-inefficient and labor-intensive: (1) object serialization/deserialization makes heavy use of reflection, an expensive runtime operation and/or (2) serialization/deserialization functions need to be hand-written and are error-prone. This paper presents Skyway, a JVM-based technique that can directly connect managed heaps of different (local or remote) JVM processes. Under Skyway, objects in the source heap can be directly written into a remote heap without changing their formats. Skyway provides performance benefits to any JVM-based system by completely eliminating the need (1) of invoking serialization/deserialization functions, thus saving CPU time, and (2) of requiring developers to hand-write serialization functions.", "venue": "International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2018-03-19", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the Twenty-Third International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2055541087", "name": "Khanh Nguyen"}, {"authorId": "2153680310", "name": "Lu Fang"}, {"authorId": "40462662", "name": "Christian Navasca"}, {"authorId": "38394648", "name": "G.
