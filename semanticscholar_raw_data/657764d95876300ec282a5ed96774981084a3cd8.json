Data scientists pose hypotheses, integrate the necessary data, and run ML pipelines of data cleaning, feature engineering, model selection and hyper-parameter tuning. The repetitive nature of these workflows, and their hierarchical composition from building blocks exhibits high computational redundancy. Existing work addresses this redundancy with coarse-grained lineage tracing and reuse for ML pipelines. This approach allows using existing ML systems, but views entire algorithms as black boxes, and thus, fails to eliminate fine-grained redundancy and to handle internal non-determinism. In this paper, we introduce LIMA, a practical framework for efficient, fine-grained lineage tracing and reuse inside ML systems. Lineage tracing of individual operations creates new challenges and opportunities. We address the large size of lineage traces with multi-level lineage tracing and reuse, as well as lineage deduplication for loops and functions; exploit full and partial reuse opportunities across the program hierarchy; and integrate this framework with task parallelism and operator fusion. The resulting framework performs fine-grained lineage tracing with low overhead, provides versioning and reproducibility, and is able to eliminate fine-grained redundancy. Our experiments on a variety of ML pipelines show performance improvements up to 12.4x.", "venue": "SIGMOD Conference", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2021-06-09", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 2021 International Conference on Management of Data"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "39454224", "name": "Arnab Phani"}, {"authorId": "2053062532", "name": "Benjamin Rath"}, {"authorId": "40237241", "name": "Matthias Boehm"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "5cbbe911564117fc4ac7c53866c189fe60166cad", "title": "SAGA: A Scalable Framework for Optimizing Data Cleaning Pipelines for Machine Learning Applications"}, {"paperId": "2aa4f898e28e4cdea16f6c7baa403a7db5d91eb5", "title": "ElasticNotebook: Enabling Live Migration for Computational Notebooks (Technical Report)"}, {"paperId": "3a29a9e6168cf1620fe76b3702e473de6f6fec67", "title": "Saturn: An Optimized Data System for Multi-Large-Model Deep Learning Workloads"}, {"paperId": "0bec90c5864ef3688b23e1922f074a8588a64740", "title": "Integrated Reproducibility with Self-describing Machine Learning Models"}, {"paperId": "67976cbac9f85ca0b82b8e22ac5ae0eeb2bb1148", "title": "Orca: Scalable Temporal Graph Neural Network Training with Theoretical Guarantees"}, {"paperId": "35383850bc203178b43e6e0b43b57197488db506", "title": "Transactional Python for Durable Machine Learning: Vision, Challenges, and Feasibility"}, {"paperId": "a24c8ad1a21bb735a327051d2b193d90669dff7d", "title": "MaskSearch: Querying Image Masks at Scale"}, {"paperId": "a12e64c8bd53136147862b570981581758e4937e", "title": "Management of Machine Learning Lifecycle Artifacts"}, {"paperId": "d9cf56bf6a33e3cf225e9e46192ab42a08fae0d6", "title": "Federated Data Preparation, Learning, and Debugging in Apache SystemDS"}, {"paperId": "6b881dd1026adcbc8deffe85c1280ad54f1d3b71", "title": "UPLIFT: Parallelization Strategies for Feature Transformations in Machine Learning Workloads"}, {"paperId": "9aa70521b1c58f3542cddf50165d74016c64c660", "title": "Enabling useful provenance in scripting languages with a human-in-the-loop"}, {"paperId": "9ffa0d2a4042bdc8e991999c8c1df1348eb60ca5", "title": "Redundancy Elimination in Distributed Matrix Computation"}, {"paperId": "e65a8c5151bb30a034248e03f12f5b4cc6115d25", "title": "Nautilus: An Optimized System for Deep Transfer Learning over Evolving Training Datasets"}, {"paperId": "2690e49c0113f1ffb884c95521ba6344067f0023", "title": "Tribuo: Machine Learning with Provenance in Java"}, {"paperId": "d59a2b2f7c9edd802abb92e6012831399d1f3a40", "title": "ExDRa: Exploratory Data Science on Federated Raw Data"}, {"paperId": "3c3f8344e58ff7a8ea9c924e428bda5b8c775df6", "title": "DAPHNE: An Open and Extensible System Infrastructure for Integrated Data Analysis Pipelines"}, {"paperId": "5aa4b98b9e0fea253b3ead8a6ccd8fb499243242", "title": "Reproducibility Report for ACM SIGMOD 2021 Paper: \u201cLIMA: Fine-grained Lineage Tracing and Reuse in Machine Learning Systems\u201d"}, {"paperId": "4d29952cf006852f4b147757b69bcf7902cec55d", "title": "Intelligent Storage System of Machine Learning Model Based on Task Similarity"}]}
