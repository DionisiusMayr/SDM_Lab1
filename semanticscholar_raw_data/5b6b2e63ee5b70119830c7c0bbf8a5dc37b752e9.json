Threatening to slow down the stream of working designs, we identify the mounting pressure of scale and complexity of (eco-)systems, of ill-defined and wicked problems, and of unclear processes, methods, and tools. We envision design itself as a core research topic in distributed systems, to understand and improve the science and practice of distributed (eco-)system design. Toward this vision, we propose the AtLarge design framework, accompanied by a set of 8 core design principles. We also propose 10 key challenges, which we hope the community can address in the following 5 years. In our experience so far, the proposed framework and principles are practical, and lead to pragmatic and innovative designs for large-scale distributed systems.", "venue": "IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2019-02-14", "journal": {"name": "2019 IEEE 39th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS)", "pages": "1765-1776"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1760940", "name": "A.
