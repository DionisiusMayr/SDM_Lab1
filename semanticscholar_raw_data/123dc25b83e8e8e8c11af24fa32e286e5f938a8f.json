Graph analytics elicits insights from large graphs to inform critical decisions for business, safety and security. This project presents novel semantics-preserving fusion transformations that optimize the speci\ufb01cations and reduce them to three primitives: reduction over paths, mapping over vertices and reduction over vertices. Reductions over paths are commonly calculated based on push or pull models that iteratively apply kernel functions at the vertices. This paper presents conditions, parametric in terms of the kernel functions, for the correctness and termination of the iterative models", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2288146098", "name": "Summary Mohsen Lesani"}], "citations": []}
