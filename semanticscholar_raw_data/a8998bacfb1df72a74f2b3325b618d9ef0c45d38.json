Leveraging student data and achievements with the assistance of machine learning to predict students' academic success can make a substantial contribution to all parties involved in devising appropriate strategies to support students. This review assesses the performance of machine learning algorithms in classifying and predicting student academic success. Four algorithms are considered for predicting student academic success: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Na\u00efve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Tree. Additionally, this review utilizes data that categorizes students' academic success into two or three categories, such as pass/fail or fail/pass/excellent.", "venue": "2023 5th International Conference on Cybernetics and Intelligent System (ICORIS)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-10-06", "journal": {"name": "2023 5th International Conference on Cybernetics and Intelligent System (ICORIS)", "pages": "1-8"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2275634379", "name": "I.
