Data Streaming refers to the concept where data is processed and transmitted continuously and in real-time without necessarily being stored in a physical location. Personal health monitors and home security systems are examples of data streaming sources. This paper presents a systematic mapping study of the performance analysis of Data Streaming systems in the context of Containerization and Microservices. The research aimed to identify the main methods, tools, and techniques used in the last five years for the execution of this type of study. The results show that there are still few performance evaluation studies for this system niche, and there are gaps that must be filled, such as the lack of analytical modeling and the disregard for communication protocols\u2019 influence.", "venue": "Iberian Conference on Information Systems and Technologies", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-06-20", "journal": {"name": "2023 18th Iberian Conference on Information Systems and Technologies (CISTI)", "pages": "1-6"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2231800494", "name": "Simone Ris"}, {"authorId": "143974575", "name": "J.
