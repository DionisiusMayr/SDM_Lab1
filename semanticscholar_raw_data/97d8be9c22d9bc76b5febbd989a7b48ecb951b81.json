Among these cutting-edge AI technologies, Generative AI has emerged as a promising instrument with the potential to empower educators and students through innovative instructional strategies. This article aims to investigate the various applications of Generative AI in education and cast light on its role in shaping the future of education. The objectives of this study are twofold: first, to investigate the various instructional strategies that can be enhanced by employing Generative AI, and second, to assess the potential impact of these strategies on student learning outcomes. To accomplish these goals, a comprehensive literature review was conducted analyzing existing studies and applications of Generative AI in educational settings. The results and discussions emphasize the numerous educational benefits of Generative AI. Educators can personalize learning experiences, create interactive content, and facilitate adaptive assessments by leveraging the capabilities of Generative AI. This individualized strategy has the potential to boost learner engagement and knowledge retention. However, despite the numerous advantages, ethical concerns and difficulties arise. The responsible incorporation of Generative AI in education requires addressing issues such as data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the educator's role in directing AI-driven learning experiences. The research concludes by emphasizing that Generative AI holds enormous promise for empowering education and transforming instructional practices. The findings highlight the importance of ongoing collaboration between educators, policymakers, and AI developers to ensure the ethical and equitable integration of Generative AI into educational environments. By embracing the potential of Generative AI while remaining vigilant regarding its challenges, the field of education can unlock novel opportunities to nurture an inclusive, adaptive, and learner-centric pedagogical landscape for tomorrow's learners. \n\u00a0", "venue": "International Journal of Business, Law, and Education", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-08-02", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Business, Law, and Education"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "114764949", "name": "Kadaruddin Kadaruddin"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "f503d176fd6038ed4db0b496ab2bb043416f0023", "title": "Future Business Workforce: Crafting a Generative AI-Centric Curriculum Today for Tomorrow's Business Education"}, {"paperId": "16cabd6f8d93f77e175f217865d7b515d3612cc1", "title": "TPACK in the age of ChatGPT and Generative AI"}, {"paperId": "00d1949695220eee33f1824235e02f359e31e4b3", "title": "Implicit Bias in Large Language Models: Experimental Proof and Implications for Education"}]}
