HeAT builds on top of PyTorch, which already provides many required features like automatic differentiation, CPU and GPU support, linear algebra operations and basic MPI functionality as well as an imperative programming paradigm allowing fast prototyping essential in scienti\ufb01c research. These features are generalized to a distributed tensor with a NumPy-like interface allowing to port existing NumPy algorithms to HPC systems nearly effortlessly.", "venue": "", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "1705474", "name": "K.
