This paper consists of three parts: 1) the industrial engineering trends and needs of the industry, 2) the support systems and methodologies developed to satisfy these needs, and 3) how the Industrial Engineering degree program and engineering education needs to evolve according to not only the new challenges that the world is facing but also the way the new generations learn. An overview of the learning methods used in Education 4.0 is presented and how these methods give an integral formation to the students of higher education.", "venue": "IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-12-18", "journal": {"name": "2023 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management (IEEM)", "pages": "0572-0576"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2282298579", "name": "V.
