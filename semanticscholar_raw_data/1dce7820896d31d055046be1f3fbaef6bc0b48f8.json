Further, new hardware technologies and system designs create a hierarchical composition that may be ideal for computational storage operations. In this article, we investigate how to support a wide variety of conflicting I/O workloads under a single storage system. We introduce the idea of a Label, a new data representation, and, we present LABIOS: a new, distributed, Label- based I/O system. LABIOS boosts I/O performance by up to 17\u00d7 via asynchronous I/O, supports heterogeneous storage resources, offers storage elasticity, and promotes in situ analytics and software defined storage support via data provisioning. LABIOS demonstrates the effectiveness of storage bridging to support the convergence of HPC and BigData workloads on a single platform.", "venue": "ACM Transactions on Storage", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-10-13", "journal": {"name": "ACM Transactions on Storage (TOS)", "pages": "1 - 34", "volume": "16"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3050809", "name": "Anthony Kougkas"}, {"authorId": "46251636", "name": "H.
