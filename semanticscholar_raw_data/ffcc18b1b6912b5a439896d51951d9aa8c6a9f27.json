Focusing on the \u201chot\u201d area of natural resource preservation, the recent appearance of more efficient and cheaper microcontrollers, the advances in low-power and long-range radios, and the availability of accompanying software tools are exploited in order to monitor water consumption and to detect and report misuse events, with reduced power and network bandwidth requirements. Quite often, large quantities of water are wasted for a variety of reasons; from broken irrigation pipes to people\u2019s negligence. To tackle this problem, the necessary design and implementation details are highlighted for an experimental water usage reporting system that exhibits Edge Artificial Intelligence (Edge AI) functionality. By combining modern technologies, such as Internet of Things (IoT), Edge Computing (EC) and Machine Learning (ML), the deployment of a compact automated detection mechanism can be easier than before, while the information that has to travel from the edges of the network to the cloud and thus the corresponding energy footprint are drastically reduced. In parallel, characteristic implementation challenges are discussed, and a first set of corresponding evaluation results is presented.", "venue": "Italian National Conference on Sensors", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-06-28", "journal": {"name": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "volume": "22"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2125725", "name": "D.
