Aiming at quality keywords, this paper designs a distributed data clustering system based on Hadoop and mahout. In order to overcome the randomness, low accuracy and many iterations of K-Means algorithm, Canopy and K-Means Clustering Algorithm based on Mahout is designed by using the advantages of Canopy algorithm, that is, no need to specify the number of clusters, high efficiency and conciseness Clustering keywords. Based on the algorithm, good results have been obtained.", "venue": "International Conference on Applied Algorithms", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2021-06-01", "journal": {"name": "2021 International Conference on Intelligent Computing, Automation and Applications (ICAA)", "pages": "484-488"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2826366", "name": "Peizhang Xie"}, {"authorId": "2148391343", "name": "Minming Mao"}, {"authorId": "2153674087", "name": "Xuguang Jin"}, {"authorId": "2158192054", "name": "Dong Chen"}, {"authorId": "1689031773", "name": "Mengyi Guo"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "bfd6fc8763cfaffcd1edc4989b7eb3a933cf9aa2", "title": "Application of canopy clustering for categorization of states based on crime against children"}, {"paperId": "a0c173bf002114358b933c9c80923e22d1cddb92", "title": "A Dual Cluster-Head Energy-Efficient Routing Algorithm Based on Canopy Optimization and K-Means for WSN"}]}
