Then, we have studied the thermodynamic exchange between the model's parameters, denoted as $\\Theta$, and the model's generated samples, denoted as $X$. We demonstrate that the training dataset and the action of the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer serve as a work source that governs the time evolution of these two subsystems. Our findings reveal that the model learns through the dissipation of heat during the generation of samples $X$, leading to an increase in the entropy of the model's parameters, $\\Theta$. Thus, the parameter subsystem acts as a heat reservoir, effectively storing the learned information. Furthermore, the role of the model's parameters as a heat reservoir provides valuable thermodynamic insights into the generalization power of over-parameterized models. This approach offers an unambiguous framework for computing information-theoretic quantities within deterministic neural networks by establishing connections with thermodynamic variables. To illustrate the utility of this framework, we introduce two information-theoretic metrics: Memorized-information (M-info) and Learned-information (L-info), which trace the dynamic flow of information during the learning process of PPMs.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-10-04", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2310.19802"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2988440", "name": "S.
