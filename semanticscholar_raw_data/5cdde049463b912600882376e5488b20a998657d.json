The new technologies provide non-contact measurements in three areas: indoor environmental monitoring, outdoor environ-mental monitoring, and equipment monitoring. This paper summarizes the specific applications of non-contact measurement based on infrared images and visible images in the areas of personnel skin temperature, position posture, the urban physical environment, building construction safety, and equipment operation status. At the same time, the challenges and opportunities associated with the application of CV technology are anticipated.", "venue": "Italian National Conference on Sensors", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-07-01", "journal": {"name": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "volume": "23"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2158327821", "name": "Bin Yang"}, {"authorId": "2194129790", "name": "Shuang Yang"}, {"authorId": "2204455479", "name": "Xin Zhu"}, {"authorId": "2221882979", "name": "Min Qi"}, {"authorId": "2222312759", "name": "He Li"}, {"authorId": "2112383236", "name": "Zhihan Lv"}, {"authorId": "1897005", "name": "Xiaogang Cheng"}, {"authorId": "2220584198", "name": "Faming Wang"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "1480899df5d17c689073d5932028059a3dbee38f", "title": "Digital Twin Approach in Buildings: Future Challenges via a Critical Literature Review"}, {"paperId": "deab00923f4ccb5ba83e37bc25ec41501ab7b330", "title": "State-of-the-Art Review and Synthesis: A Requirement-based Roadmap for Standardized Predictive Maintenance Automation Using Digital Twin Technologies"}, {"paperId": "12702f5a2ec0931d91f84814843e6e88fbf2b33b", "title": "Integrating ChatGPT, Bard, and leading-edge generative artificial intelligence in building and construction industry: applications, framework, challenges, and future scope"}]}
