However, implementing collaborative graph visualizations can be very resource consuming and existing prototypes cannot be reused easily. We present a work-in-progress collaborative experimental environment for graph visualization research in VR, which is highly modular, contains all fundamental functionality of a collaborative graph visualization, and provides common interaction techniques. Our environment enables researchers to create and evaluate modules in the same environment for a wide range of experiments", "venue": "Eurographics Conference on Visualization", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"pages": "9-11"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "41095043", "name": "David Heidrich"}, {"authorId": "9840068", "name": "A.
