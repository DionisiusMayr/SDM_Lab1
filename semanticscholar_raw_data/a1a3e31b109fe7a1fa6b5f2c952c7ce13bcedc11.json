It usually comes at the cost of finding a trade-off between data throughput and the cost of expressive inferences. Strider-lsa proposes such a trade-off and combines a scalable RDF stream processing engine with an efficient reasoning system. The main reasoning tasks are based on a query rewriting approach for SPARQL that benefits from an intelligent encoding of RDFS+ (RDFS + owl:sameAs) ontology elements. Strider-lsa runs in production at a major international water management company to detect anomalies from sensor streams. The system is evaluated along different dimensions and over multiple datasets to emphasize its performance.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2017-08-22", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/1708.06521"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3464627", "name": "Xiangnan Ren"}, {"authorId": "2141773", "name": "Olivier Cur\u00e9"}, {"authorId": "3045686", "name": "Hubert Naacke"}, {"authorId": "2149140930", "name": "Ke Li"}], "citations": []}
