We consider random sampling for answering the ubiquitous class of group-by queries, which first group data according to one or more attributes, and then aggregate within each group after filtering through a predicate. The challenge with group-by queries is that a sampling method cannot focus on optimizing the quality of a single answer (e.g. the mean of selected data), but must simultaneously optimize the quality of a set of answers (one per group).We present CVOPT, a query- and data-driven sampling framework for a set of group-by queries. To evaluate the quality of a sample, CVOPT defines a metric based on the norm (e.g. \u21132 or \u2113\u221e) of the coefficients of variation (CVs) of different answers, and constructs a stratified sample that provably optimizes the metric. CVOPT can handle group-by queries on data where groups have vastly different statistical characteristics, such as frequencies, means, or variances. CVOPT jointly optimizes for multiple aggregations and multiple group-by clauses, and provides a way to prioritize specific groups or aggregates. It can be tuned to cases when partial information about a query workload is known, such as a data warehouse where queries are run periodically.Our experimental results show that CVOPT outperforms the current state-of-the-art on sample quality and estimation accuracy for group-by queries. On a set of queries on two real-world data sets, CVOPT yields relative errors that are 5\u00d7 smaller than competing approaches, under the same space budget.", "venue": "IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2019-09-05", "journal": {"name": "2020 IEEE 36th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE)", "pages": "541-552"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3400339", "name": "Trong Duc Nguyen"}, {"authorId": "38159019", "name": "Ming-Hung Shih"}, {"authorId": "153040932", "name": "Sai Sree Parvathaneni"}, {"authorId": "39719831", "name": "Bojian Xu"}, {"authorId": "145860176", "name": "D.
