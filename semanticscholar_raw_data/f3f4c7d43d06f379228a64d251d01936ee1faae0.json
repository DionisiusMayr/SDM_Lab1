This is a useful and practical skill, but it gives limited insight into how queries are processed by relational database engines. In contrast, relational algebra is a commonly used internal representation of queries by database engines, but can be challenging for students to grasp. We developed a tool we call Relational Playground for database students to explore the connection between relational algebra and SQL.", "venue": "Proceedings of the 2nd International Workshop on Data Systems Education: Bridging education practice with education research", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book"], "publicationDate": "2023-06-23", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 2nd International Workshop on Data Systems Education: Bridging education practice with education research"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2807081", "name": "Michael J.
