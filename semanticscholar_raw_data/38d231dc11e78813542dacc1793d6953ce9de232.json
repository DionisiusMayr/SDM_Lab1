This paper sheds new light on the correlation of inter-arrival times of both read and write requests at the block level in four representative cloud storage workloads \u2013 AliCloud, Systor\u201917, MSRC and FIU. Our study reveals that I/O arrivals at the block level are very complex in modern cloud storage. There is a certain degree of correlation in the long-term timescale for request arrival intervals in AliCloud and Systor\u201917_read. Request arrival intervals in MSRC, FIU and Systor\u201917_write, however, are almost uncorrelated. The Gaussianity test confirms that I/O burstiness appears to be Gaussian in AliCloud_write and Systor\u201917_read, but the burstiness is non-Gaussian in other workloads. Importantly, we unfold the existence of self-similarity in cloud storage workloads with a certain degree of correlations, via visual evidence, the autocorrelation structure of the aggregated process of I/O request sequences, and Hurst parameter estimates. We further design an alpha-stable workload model for synthetic I/O generation, and the experimental results demonstrate that our model has an edge over conventional models in terms of accurately emulating I/O burstiness.", "venue": "IEEE transactions on computers", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-10-01", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Transactions on Computers", "pages": "2726-2739", "volume": "72"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2054838166", "name": "Qiang Zou"}, {"authorId": "1778450", "name": "Yifeng Zhu"}, {"authorId": "3269044", "name": "Jianxi Chen"}, {"authorId": "35143368", "name": "Yuhui Deng"}, {"authorId": "2153438883", "name": "Xiao Qin"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "fe214ae34265f06e6ad93712175b3ffe266a97cd", "title": "Cloud Storage Workload Characterization: An Approach with Time-Series Analysis"}]}
