So teamwork is necessary for stroke care and recovery. Mainly, the recovery process involves treating all the illnesses derived from the stroke. Hence, communication, collaboration, and monitoring of the rehabilitation process along with an integral treatment must be provided. Nevertheless, these elements are not well established in hospitals where a high rotation of physicians and nurses along with a lack of monitoring of the rehabilitation process affects the patients' recovery. Therefore, this article presents an exploratory study to understand the interactions of people who have suffered a stroke with a multidisciplinary team. Besides, we describe a conceptual model to improve the collaborative activities of professionals involved in rehabilitating people who have suffered strokes. We focus on improving the rehabilitation process according to a workflow that contemplates the development of communications channels considering collaboration, cooperation, and human-computer interactions. Also, we describe a mockup design that represents the prototype based on the proposed workflow.", "venue": "2022 10th International Conference in Software Engineering Research and Innovation (CONISOFT)", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-10-01", "journal": {"name": "2022 10th International Conference in Software Engineering Research and Innovation (CONISOFT)", "pages": "102-111"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2212454159", "name": "Sof\u00eda Isabel Fern\u00e1ndez Gregorio"}, {"authorId": "1405639089", "name": "L.
