Text-derived features are quantified by tracking high-density clusters of sentence-level representations of Reddit posts within specific US states\u2019 COVID-19 subreddits. We benchmark these clustered embedding features against features extracted from other high-quality datasets. In a threshold-classification task, we show that they outperform all other feature types at predicting upward trend signals, a significant result for infectious disease modelling in areas where epidemiological data is unreliable. Subsequently, in a time-series forecasting task, we fully utilise the predictive power of the caseload and compare the relative strengths of using different supplementary datasets as covariate feature sets in a transformer-based time-series model.", "venue": "North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-05-20", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2205.10408"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2166045586", "name": "Felix Drinkall"}, {"authorId": "8106073", "name": "S.
