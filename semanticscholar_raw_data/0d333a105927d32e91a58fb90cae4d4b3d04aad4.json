Cloud computing offers features like availability and scalability, reliability, fault-tolerance and an environment to incorporate big data. Although big data work outs much of the present issues but it still have quite issues or we can say some gaps that rise worries and need refinement. Data heterogeneity, security, disaster recovery mechanisms, scalability, privacy, data governance policies and other challenges are yet to be addressed. In this paper Big data\u2019s definition, characteristics, and classification are described, also its analysis through cloud computing environment and techniques that can be used for its security. Further it describes the relationship between the two technologies.", "venue": "", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "Electrical Engineering eJournal"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2127056203", "name": "Aakriti Johar"}, {"authorId": "2141452565", "name": "Aarti Sharma"}, {"authorId": "151369554", "name": "Smriti Arora"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "01f05e18bab99455cb0b74b88444a083c337c828", "title": "Cloud-Based E-Governance in India"}]}
