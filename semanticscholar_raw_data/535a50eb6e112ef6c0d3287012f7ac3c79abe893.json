Currently, FISIP Nurtanio University manages its library using Senayan Library Management System (SLiMS) 8 Akasia, a free web-based open source software. SLiMS 8 Akasia has provided basic services such as membership management, visitor control, circulation services, and online public access catalogue (OPAC). However, to enrich the library collection, this research proposes a concept that allows lecturers at FISIP to upload their PDF files (e-books) as an additional collection in the library. Although the e-book feature is already available in SLiMS 8 Akasia, currently only librarians or library managers can upload pdf files. This concept aims to provide lecturers with the opportunity to contribute to expanding the digital library collection and increasing access to various information sources.", "venue": "2023 International Conference on Informatics Engineering, Science & Technology (INCITEST)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-10-25", "journal": {"name": "2023 International Conference on Informatics Engineering, Science & Technology (INCITEST)", "pages": "1-7"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2280953987", "name": "Fikri Nugraha"}, {"authorId": "2238375669", "name": "Yeffry Handoko Putra"}], "citations": []}
