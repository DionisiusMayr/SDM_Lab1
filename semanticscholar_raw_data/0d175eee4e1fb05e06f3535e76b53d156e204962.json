To tackle the real world challenge in this area, we formulate a new problem, called fine-grained pat- tern matching. It allows users to define varied deviations to different segments of a given pattern, and adaptive breakpoint of adjunct segments, which urges the dramatically increased complexity against traditional pattern matching problem over stream. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to solve this problem. In the pruning phase, we propose Equal Length Block(ELB) representation and Block- Skipping Pruning(BSP) policy, which guarantees low cost feature calculation, efficient pruning and no false dismissals. In the post-processing phase, a delta-function is proposed to en- able us to conduct exact matching and determine the adaptive breakpoint in linear complexity. Extensive experiments are evaluated on synthetic and real-world datasets, which illustrates that our algorithm outperforms the brute-force method and MSM, a multi-step filter mechanism over the multi-scaled representation, by orders of magnitude.", "venue": "", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2017-10-27", "journal": {"name": "", "volume": ""}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1403979994", "name": "Rong Kang"}, {"authorId": "2109118305", "name": "Chen Wang"}, {"authorId": "46808587", "name": "Peng Wang"}, {"authorId": "2111071283", "name": "Yuting Ding"}, {"authorId": "2144499800", "name": "Jianmin Wang"}], "citations": []}
