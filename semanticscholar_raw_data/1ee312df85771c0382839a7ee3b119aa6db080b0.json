Those optimization problems are more complex and interesting when it comes to multiple OLAP queries. In this article, the authors explore the potential of distributed environment for an established data warehouse, database-related optimization problem, the problem of Multiple Query Optimization (MQO). In traditional DW materializing views is an optimization technic to solve such problem by storing pre-computed join or frequently asked queries. In this era of big data this kind of view materialization is not suitable due to the data size. In this article, the authors tackle the problem of MQO on distributed DW by using a multiple, small, shared and easy to maintain shared data. The evaluation shows that, compared to available default execution engine, the authors' approach consumes on average 20% less memory in the Map-scan task and it is 12% faster regarding the execution time of interactive and reporting queries from TPC-DS.", "venue": "International Journal of Data Warehousing and Mining", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2018-07-01", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Data Warehousing and Mining"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "72465831", "name": "Ratsimbazafy Rado"}, {"authorId": "9421445", "name": "O.
