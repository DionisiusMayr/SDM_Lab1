In this paper, graph coloring is applied to encryption technology to encrypt the network model. In this paper, the network topology and coloring are combined, and a new network encryption coding is proposed. The security of this kind of password is based on determining that the problem of isomorphism of two graphs is NPC problem. Considering that some network model are maximal planar graph, the number of vertices and edges corresponding to its dual model is smaller than original model, we can consider encryption from the perspective of its dual model. In this paper, the dual model of Apollonian network model is selected as an example to describe the encryption algorithm, the GEMTC-chromatic number are determined, and the coloring characteristics of its minimum spanning trees and largest leaf spanning tree are studied, the relationship of GEMTC-chromatic numbers between the two kinds of spanning trees and dual models is found.", "venue": "2020 IEEE 5th Information Technology and Mechatronics Engineering Conference (ITOEC)", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2020-06-01", "journal": {"name": "2020 IEEE 5th Information Technology and Mechatronics Engineering Conference (ITOEC)", "pages": "226-230"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "145531155", "name": "Jing Su"}, {"authorId": "2157845248", "name": "Hongyu Wang"}, {"authorId": "145323141", "name": "B.
