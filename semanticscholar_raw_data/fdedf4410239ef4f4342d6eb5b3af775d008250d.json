Adoption of agile software development methodologies has reduced time to market and improved success rates; however, deployment obstacles often impede the quick delivery of the new and improved features to end users. This paper deals with DevOps, a new methodology that extends agile processes to include operations. DevOps methodology adopted with cloud computing could immediately benefit current practitioners from various software development parties while a focus on the young will ensure that DevOps ideals and processes will be taken forward into the longer\u2010term future. Moving towards clouds, adopting DevOps culture, and implementing DevOps tools will produce more innovative services at lower cost and with higher quality. Wider adoption of the cloud DevOps will bring cloud DevOps features, and the benefit of agile software development, automation, and elastic resource provisioning. Additionally, teaching cloud DevOps in university will help to overcome the barriers to its adoption and maximize its indirect socioeconomic impact.", "venue": "Concurrency and Computation", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2017-03-10", "journal": {"name": "Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience", "volume": "29"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "41198004", "name": "M.
