An improved short text clustering algorithm is used to extract the design elements of laptops. Based on the traditional questionnaire, we extract the user\u2019s attention factors, score the emotional tendency, and analyze the user\u2019s needs based on the Kano model. Then, we select 10 laptops, process them by the improved algorithm, cluster the evaluation words and quantify the emotional orientation matching. Based on the obtained data, we design a visual interaction logic and usability test. These prove that the proposed method is feasible and effective.", "venue": "Inf.", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-02-25", "journal": {"name": "Inf.", "pages": "110", "volume": "13"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "49357508", "name": "Zhiyong Xiong"}, {"authorId": "2151195494", "name": "Zhaoxiong Yan"}, {"authorId": "2156434028", "name": "Huanan Yao"}, {"authorId": "3279808", "name": "Shangsong Liang"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "15214f985a722c5a56654eec060a3ebe6bc15607", "title": "5-Star Hotel Customer Satisfaction Analysis Using Hybrid Methodology"}, {"paperId": "4a4505c646a76fadcb2d679f8f1e0aa695b4aab8", "title": "COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF EMOTION ANALYSIS METHODS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF HOTEL USERS TURKISH AND ENGLISH COMMENTS"}]}
