In this paper we shortly describe an application (a multiscale material design problem) that requires HPC for several reasons. The problem of interest is analysis of the fiber-reinforced concrete and we focus on modelling of stiffness through numerical homogenization and computing local material properties by inverse analysis. Both problems require a repeated solution of large-scale finite element problems up to 200 million degrees of freedom and therefore the importance of HPC computing is evident.", "venue": "", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2017-12-20", "journal": {"name": "Cybernetics and Information Technologies", "pages": "16 - 5", "volume": "17"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "34939027", "name": "R.
