Many of these devices collect data in di\ufb00erent forms, be it audio, location data, or user commands. In civil or criminal nature investigations, the data collected can act as evidence for the prosecution or the defense. This data can also be used as a component of cybersecurity e\ufb00orts. When data is extracted from these devices, investigators are expected to do so using proven methods. Still, unfortunately, given the heterogeneity in the types of devices that need to be examined, few widely agreed-upon standards exist. In this paper, we look at some of the architectures, current frameworks, and methods available to perform forensic analysis of IoT devices to provide a roadmap for investigators and researchers to form the basis of an investigation.", "venue": "Journal of Digital Forensics, Security and Law", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-09-30", "journal": {"name": "J.
