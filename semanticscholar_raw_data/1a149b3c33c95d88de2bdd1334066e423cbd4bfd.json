A comprehensive and structured survey of the scheduling algorithms proposed so far is presented here using a novel multidimensional classification framework. These dimensions are (i) meeting quality requirements, (ii) scheduling entities, and (iii) adapting to dynamic environments; each dimension has its own taxonomy. An empirical evaluation framework for these algorithms is recommended. This survey identifies various open issues and directions for future research.", "venue": "ACM Computing Surveys", "year": 2015, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2015-04-16", "journal": {"name": "ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR)", "pages": "1 - 38", "volume": "47"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "145165396", "name": "Nidhi Tiwari"}, {"authorId": "40490806", "name": "S.
