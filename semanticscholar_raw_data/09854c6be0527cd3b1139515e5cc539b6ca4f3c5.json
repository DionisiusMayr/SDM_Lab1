For precise evaluation of the supplier\u2019s performance on sustainability criteria researchers have mainly focused on Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) and Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) approaches. The objective of the paper is to evaluate the supplier\u2019s sustainability performance through FIS and fuzzy MCDM approaches. Further, the results are compared and utilised to develop the Sustainable Supplier Selection (SSS) framework for the iron and steel industry of India. To calculate Suppliers Performance Index (SPI), three distinct FIS engines have been developed for each sustainability dimensions and fuzzy AHP and TOPSIS techniques are used for the MCDM environment. The results provide a deep inside of the sustainability performance of each supplier. It elicits from the results of two approaches, that ranks are interchanged among the top two suppliers.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2020-03-11", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Sustainable Engineering", "pages": "441 - 462", "volume": "13"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "48889247", "name": "N.
