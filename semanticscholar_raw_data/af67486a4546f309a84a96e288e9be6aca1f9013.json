The performance of the federal recommendation collaborative filtering model with different application scenarios in each scenario is compared and studied. Finally, we compare the effects of altered privacy protection strategies on the training process of federal recommendation collaborative filtering model.", "venue": "2022 IEEE 4th International Conference on Civil Aviation Safety and Information Technology (ICCASIT)", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-10-12", "journal": {"name": "2022 IEEE 4th International Conference on Civil Aviation Safety and Information Technology (ICCASIT)", "pages": "164-168"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2198608863", "name": "Zijia Xu"}, {"authorId": "2198622093", "name": "Jiashi Sun"}, {"authorId": "2108314133", "name": "Jiangshan Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2125065072", "name": "Yupeng Liu"}], "citations": []}
