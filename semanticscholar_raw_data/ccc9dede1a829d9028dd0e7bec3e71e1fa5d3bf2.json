BSMA is designed to benchmark data management systems supporting analytical queries over social media. It is different to existing benchmarks in that: 1) Both real-life data and a synthetic data generator are provided. The real-life dataset contains a social network of 1.6 million users, and all their tweeting and retweeting activities. The data generator can generate both social networks and synthetic timelines that follow data distributions determined by predefined parameters. 2) A set of workloads are provided. The data generator is in responsible for producing updates. A workload generator produces queries based on predefined query templates by generating query arguments online. BSMA workloads cover a large amount of queries with graph operations, temporal queries, hotspot queries, and aggregate queries. Furthermore, the argument generator is capable of sampling data items in the timeline following power-law distribution online. 3) A toolkit is provided to measure and report the performance of systems that implement the benchmark. Furthermore, a prototype system based on dataset and workloads of BSMA is also implemented. The demonstration will include two parts, i.e. the internals of data and workload generator, as well as the performance testing of reference implementations.", "venue": "Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment", "year": 2014, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2014-08-01", "journal": {"name": "Proc.
