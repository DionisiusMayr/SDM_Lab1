There are many sources where this information comes from, among them, it is possible to cite: financial transnational records, internet banking, call centers, ATMs, sensors, among others. As the amount of data is increasingly really quickly and the importance of the information inside the big data is crucial to the world, new tools and technologies are appearing to support the use and the manipulation of big amounts of data. This paper presents a comparative analysis of two data models, a multidimensional data model (Data Warehouse) and a non-relational data model, also known as NoSQL, in order to show their efficiency about insert and query the data in a context of big volumes of data.", "venue": "International Journal of Computer Applications", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2020-12-17", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Computer Applications"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2080445129", "name": "Maria Camila S. de Lira"}, {"authorId": "115508894", "name": "A.
