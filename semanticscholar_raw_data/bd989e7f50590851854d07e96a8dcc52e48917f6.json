Yet, vehicles and operators visiting several farms during routine activities can also contribute to disease spread. Indeed, if contaminated, they can act as mechanical vectors of fomites, generating indirect contacts between visited farms. While data on animal exchanges is often available in national databases, information about the daily itineraries of trucks and operators is rare because difficult to obtain. Thus, some unavoidable approximations have been frequently introduced in the description of indirect contacts in epidemic models. Here, we showed that the level of detail in such description can significantly affect the predictions on disease dynamics. Our analyses focused on the potential spread of a disease in a dairy farm system subject of a comprehensive data collection campaign on calf transportations. We developed two temporal multilayer networks to model between-farm contacts generated by either animal exchanges (direct contacts) and connections operated by trucks moving calves (indirect contacts). The complete model used the full knowledge of the daily trucks\u2019 itineraries, while the partial informed one used only a subset of such available information. To account for various conditions of pathogen survival ability and effectiveness of cleaning operations, we performed a sensitivity analysis on trucks\u2019 contamination period. An accurate description of indirect contacts was crucial both to correctly predict the final size of epidemics and to identify the seed farms responsible for generating the most severe outbreaks. The importance of detailed information emerged even more clearly in the case of short contamination periods. Our conclusions could be extended to between-farm contacts generated by other vehicles and operators. Overcoming these information gaps would be decisive for a deeper understanding of epidemic spread in livestock and to develop effective control plans.", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2019-10-17", "journal": {"name": "PLoS ONE", "volume": "14"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "150007202", "name": "Alba Bernini"}, {"authorId": "3278213", "name": "L.
