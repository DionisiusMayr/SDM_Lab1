Learning to schedule perceiving models and analyzing the collected videos intelligently will be potential sparks for VIoT. In this paper, to address the challenges posed by the fine-grained and interrelated vision tool usage of VIoT, we build VIoTGPT, the framework based on LLMs to correctly interact with humans, query knowledge videos, and invoke vision models to accomplish complicated tasks. To support VIoTGPT and related future works, we meticulously crafted the training dataset and established benchmarks involving 11 representative vision models across three categories based on semi-automatic annotations. To guide LLM to act as the intelligent agent towards intelligent VIoT, we resort to ReAct instruction tuning based on the collected VIoT dataset to learn the tool capability. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of VIoTGPT.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-12-01", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2312.00401"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2269696937", "name": "Yaoyao Zhong"}, {"authorId": "2263678904", "name": "Mengshi Qi"}, {"authorId": "2237887563", "name": "Rui Wang"}, {"authorId": "2269443069", "name": "Yuhan Qiu"}, {"authorId": "2269473332", "name": "Yang Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2263653397", "name": "Huadong Ma"}], "citations": []}
