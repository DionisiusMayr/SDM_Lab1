In general, depth information is essential for navigating three-dimensional environments and for the consistent parameter calibration of the visual models. This work proposes a new solution, including depth information in the visual path-following (VPF) problem, which allows the variation of the perception horizon at runtime while forcing the coupling between optical and geometric quantities. A new NMPC (nonlinear model predictive control) framework considering the addition of a new input to an original solution for the constrained VPF-NMPC allows the maintenance of low computational complexity. Experimental results in an outdoor environment with a medium-sized commercial robot demonstrate the correctness of the proposal.", "venue": "Robotica (Cambridge.
