In this manuscript, we propose a behavior-driven development method for microservice applications. The proposed method starts with writing end-to-end tests at the system or application level and then moves down to the microservice level, where component and unit tests are written. Next, code that passes these tests is developed one by one for each level. Once user stories are covered, our method loops again to integrate negative tests to achieve holistic testing for the microservices and the application. Finally, the proposed method is validated with an application with five microservices. Results confirm that the proposed method matches with the generally accepted test pyramid.", "venue": "International Journal of Computers", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2021-12-09", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Computers"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3353413", "name": "Tugkan Tuglular"}, {"authorId": "39076133", "name": "D.
