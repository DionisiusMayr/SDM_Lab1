MALDI-TOF MS is particularly successful in library-based microbial identification at the species level as it analyzes the molecular weight of peptides and ribosomal proteins. FT-IR allows more accurate classification of bacteria at the subspecies level due to the high sensitivity, specificity and repeatability of FT-IR signals from bacteria, which is not achievable with MALDI-TOF MS. Previous studies have shown that more accurate identification results can be obtained by the fusion of FT-IR and MALDI-TOF MS spectral data. Here, we constructed 20 groups of model microbiota samples and used FT-IR, MALDI-TOF MS, and their fusion data to classify them. Hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) showed that the classification accuracy of FT-IR, MALDI-TOF MS, and the fusion data was 85%, 90%, and 100%, respectively. These results indicate that both FT-IR and MALDI-TOF MS can effectively classify specific microbiota, and the fusion of their spectral data could improve the classification accuracy. The FT-IR and MALDI-TOF MS data fusion strategy may be a promising technology for specific microbiota classification.", "venue": "In Analysis", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-10-06", "journal": {"name": "The Analyst"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2256952484", "name": "Wenjing Gao"}, {"authorId": "2255817608", "name": "Ying Han"}, {"authorId": "6272208", "name": "Liangqiang Chen"}, {"authorId": "2216602519", "name": "Xue Tan"}, {"authorId": "2255787692", "name": "Jieyou Liu"}, {"authorId": "2256123091", "name": "Jinghang Xie"}, {"authorId": "2216456485", "name": "Bin Li"}, {"authorId": "2216117153", "name": "Huilin Zhao"}, {"authorId": "2256559821", "name": "Shaoning Yu"}, {"authorId": "2216214249", "name": "Huabin Tu"}, {"authorId": "2056751582", "name": "Bin Feng"}, {"authorId": "2256810299", "name": "Fan Yang"}], "citations": []}
