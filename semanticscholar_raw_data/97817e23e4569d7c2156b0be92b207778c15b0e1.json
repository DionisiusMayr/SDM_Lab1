As a result, new technologies have emerged to facilitate the processing of data as well the management of the datacenters used by these data processing tools. As a cluster manager, Apache Mesos falls into the latter category. Mesos works by creating an abstraction layer that allows multiple frameworks to share resources from a vast collection of nodes. In contrast to models in which resources were statically reserved for each framework, Mesos acts as a broker for traditional resources: CPU, Memory, and Disk Space. With this model, each framework is capable of dynamically using as many or as few resources as needed during execution. The Mesos model was created with the goal of increasing hardware resource utilization in datacenters. However, the model does not account for the increase in energy and power consumption that are created as a direct consequence of high utilization. Peak power is important to consider due to the cost of cooling [17], the physical limitations of power delivery [59], as well increasing costs per Watt of peak critical power factored in when building a datacenter [69]. Furthermore, there are scenarios where reducing power demand for a specific time period can result in costs savings. For example, reducing power demand during hours designated by power providers as peak hours, where the cost per Watt is several", "venue": "", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Environmental Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "", "volume": ""}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2091942003", "name": "Renan DelValle Rueda"}], "citations": []}
