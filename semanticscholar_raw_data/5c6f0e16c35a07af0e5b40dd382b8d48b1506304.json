However, the current available neck function assessment method are subjective and coarse-grained. In this paper, based on the relationship among CS, cervical structure, cervical vertebra function, and surface electromyography (sEMG), we seek to develop a clustering algorithms on the sEMG data set collected from the clinical environment and implement the division. We proposed and developed the framework EasiCS, which consists of dimension reduction, clustering algorithm EasiSOM, spectral clustering algorithm EasiSC. The EasiCS outperform the commonly used seven algorithms overall.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2019-05-15", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/1905.05987"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2167294724", "name": "Nana Wang"}, {"authorId": "50407981", "name": "Li-xia Cui"}, {"authorId": "2107914608", "name": "Xi Huang"}, {"authorId": "38214288", "name": "Yingcong Xiang"}, {"authorId": "2144570437", "name": "Jing Xiao"}, {"authorId": "2048741715", "name": "Yi Rao"}], "citations": []}
