More gadgets can connect to the Internet thanks to IoT and cloud computing. With more Internet-connected gadgets, edge and fog computing are growing. These connected gadgets needs the huge data processing at once with minimum latency. The Hadoop scheduling with efficient novel algorithm is necessitate. This paper developed an enhanced version of the nature-inspired MVO approach for calculating mode selection. Total execution time forms an objective function. The newly introduced cognitive factor considerably upgrades the IMVO output.", "venue": "2022 IEEE Conference on Interdisciplinary Approaches in Technology and Management for Social Innovation (IATMSI)", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-12-21", "journal": {"name": "2022 IEEE Conference on Interdisciplinary Approaches in Technology and Management for Social Innovation (IATMSI)", "pages": "1-6"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2109793877", "name": "Sonia Sharma"}, {"authorId": "51241383", "name": "R.
