While the involvement of multiple languages (often including both managed and native languages) provides much convenience in data manipulation and transformation, it comes at a performance cost --- managed languages need a managed runtime, incurring much overhead. In addition, each switch from a managed to a native runtime (and vice versa) requires marshalling or unmarshalling of an ocean of data objects, taking a large fraction of the execution time. This paper presents Niijima, an optimizing compiler for Microsoft's Scope/Cosmos, which can consolidate C#-based user-defined operators (UDOs) across SQL statements, thereby reducing the number of dataflow vertices that require the managed runtime, and thus the amount of C# computations and the data marshalling cost. We demonstrate that Niijima has reduced job latency by an average of 24% and up to 3.3x, on a series of production jobs.", "venue": "Symposium on Operating Systems Principles", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2019-10-27", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 27th ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "38394648", "name": "G.
