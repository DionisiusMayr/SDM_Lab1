A concise overview of the evolution, architecture, advantages and challenges of vector databases are presented in this paper. To convert unstructured data into vectors, various embedding techniques with their in-depth technical description are also surveyed in this research paper. The existing vector databases\u2019 characteristics and features are described to select an appropriate vector database. The embedding and indexing techniques are thoroughly discussed to help the research community experiment with combining them to develop their application. The challenges of vector databases, like selecting distance metrics, dimensionality, data integrity, cost, etc. are presented. This information on vector database systems will help researchers to exhibit further advancements in their data science applications.", "venue": "2023 International Workshop on Artificial Intelligence and Image Processing (IWAIIP)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-12-01", "journal": {"name": "2023 International Workshop on Artificial Intelligence and Image Processing (IWAIIP)", "pages": "231-236"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2292313888", "name": "Sanjay Kukreja"}, {"authorId": "2292271959", "name": "Tarun Kumar"}, {"authorId": "2292328278", "name": "Vishal Bharate"}, {"authorId": "2292330695", "name": "Amit Purohit"}, {"authorId": "2292324382", "name": "Abhijit Dasgupta"}, {"authorId": "2292320918", "name": "Debashis Guha"}], "citations": []}
