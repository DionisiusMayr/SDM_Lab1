This preprocessing happens only once, so that loading and indexing the data in a database or triple store may be an overkill. In this paper, we present an approach that allows preprocessing large tabular data in Datalog \u2013 without indexing the data. The Datalog query is translated to Unix Bash and can be executed in a shell. Our experiments show that, for the use case of data preprocessing, our approach is competitive with state-of-the-art systems in terms of scalability and speed, while at the same time requiring only a Bash shell, and a Unix-compatible operating system. We also provide a basic SPARQL and OWL 2 to Datalog converter to make our system interoperable with semantic web standards.", "venue": "", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2105140859", "name": "Thomas Pellissier Tanon Thomas Rebele"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "07aef0b1c1ee3e36433eec009b855f6a21067244", "title": "Bash Datalog: Answering Datalog Queries with Unix Shell Commands"}]}
