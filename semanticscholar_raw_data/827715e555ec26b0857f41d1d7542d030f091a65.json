Striking this balance can be costly in terms of effort, data utility and computation costs. Moreover, current approaches in scalable data systems often treat privacy as an access problem, which is at odds with important legal and design principles. A plethora of privacy preserving-and enhancing-technologies are available, yet their adoption in production data systems still faces challenges. In particular, their focus is often on narrow use cases such as external data sharing, on mostly existing data sets, rendering them unusable in real-time data architectures. In this paper we argue engineering teams should \u201cshift left\u201c with their data privacy efforts, to the point of data collection. We show how privacy challenges in production architectures can be addressed without compromising speed, data quality or privacy. We provide a detailed yet practical explanation of an architectural set-up that allows users to launch privacy streams in seconds.", "venue": "IEEE Data Engineering Bulletin", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "IEEE Data Eng.
