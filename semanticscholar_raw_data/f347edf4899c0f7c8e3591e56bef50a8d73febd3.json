To further promote the development of our Geography information technology, cloud computing can be used to construct the system of the Geography environment information service application framework. It can also improve reusability and sharing of the information of Geography resources and extendibility of application system. In this paper, an OLAP system based on cloud computing platforms has been created referring to national welfare projects of ocean. The system provides its users multidimensional views, through which users can, from diverse angles and different levels, observe and study the data and comprehend them in depth.", "venue": "IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Physics", "Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2018-12-13", "journal": {"name": "IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering", "volume": "452"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "47412655", "name": "Guangxin Zhu"}, {"authorId": "2118439564", "name": "Haiyang Chen"}, {"authorId": "49235623", "name": "Mingjie Xu"}, {"authorId": "11305716", "name": "Jun Yu"}, {"authorId": "2055563664", "name": "Yang Ling"}, {"authorId": "2144735465", "name": "Lin Wang"}, {"authorId": "49508809", "name": "Zhu Mei"}], "citations": []}
