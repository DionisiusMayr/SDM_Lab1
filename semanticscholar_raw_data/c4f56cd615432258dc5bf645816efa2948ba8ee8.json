Big data analytics play an important role as data mining techniques are not capable to handle these big data. big data having large, complex and velocity characteristics which are research area now a days. For large volume data, it having large high dimensions need new or modified existing feature selection techniques. In this paper, we have discussed difference feature selection methods like filters, wrappers, embedded and hybrid. We have also discussed use of feature selection method in big data are till now introduced for specific applications. Here, in this paper, some feature selection filter based methods are tested with distributed parallel environment of big data and it performed better compare to original dataset in terms of time and accuracy.", "venue": "", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "38336831", "name": "Falguni N.
