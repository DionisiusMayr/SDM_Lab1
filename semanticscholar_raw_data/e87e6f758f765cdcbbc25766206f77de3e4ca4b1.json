When building and implementing systems, security in distributed systems presents special issues that must be taken into account. There are various security mechanisms that are in use to mitigate these attacks. Also, it has been proven that it is more effective using machine learning and artificial intelligence in mitigation mechanisms rather than using other mitigation methods, and also today the world is moving forward with machine learning and deep learning concepts. This paper provides a wide survey of various distributed system attacks, and the mitigation methods proposed against them, also this paper provides an in-depth analysis of using machine learning and deep learning techniques in mitigating the issues and attacks faced by distributed systems.", "venue": "2023 3rd International Conference on Advanced Research in Computing (ICARC)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-02-23", "journal": {"name": "2023 3rd International Conference on Advanced Research in Computing (ICARC)", "pages": "172-177"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2220059216", "name": "Vishmila Mahaliyanaarachchi"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "3596649e7c380072741b4d376ab1e88c09cbcff6", "title": "A comprehensive survey of performance, security and privacy issues in the network interface layer of the TCP/IP"}]}
