Feature selection is the key step to build prediction model of students\u2019 performance, which can improve the accuracy of prediction and help to identify factors that have significant impact on students\u2019 performance. In this paper, a hybrid feature selection method named rank and heuristic (RnkHEU) was proposed. This novel feature selection method generates the set of candidate features by scoring and ranking firstly and then uses heuristic method to generate the final results. The experimental results show that the four major evaluation criteria have similar performance in predicting students\u2019 performance, and the heuristic search strategy can significantly improve the accuracy of prediction compared with forward search method. Because the proposed RnkHEU integrates ranking-based forward and heuristic search, it can further improve the accuracy of predicting students\u2019 performance with commonly used classifiers about 10% and improve the precision of predicting students\u2019 academic failure by up to 45%.", "venue": "Scientific Programming", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-11-11", "journal": {"name": "Sci.
