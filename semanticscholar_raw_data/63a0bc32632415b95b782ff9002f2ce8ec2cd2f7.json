A key question is to identify setups that can achieve such goal within current technologies. In this work, we provide formal evidence that sampling bit-strings from a periodic evolution of a unitary drawn from the circular orthogonal ensemble (COE) cannot be efficiently simulated with classical computers. As the statistical properties of COE coincide with a large class of driven analog quantum systems thanks to the Floquet eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, our results indicate the possibility that those driven systems could constitute practical candidates for a sampling quantum advantage. To further support this, we give numerical examples of driven disordered Ising chains and 1D driven Bose\u2013Hubbard model.", "venue": "Quantum Science and Technology", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Physics"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2020-02-27", "journal": {"name": "Quantum Science and Technology", "volume": "8"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "13210350", "name": "J.
