These applications are all based on the modern data stream processing systems that implement resource allocation and management in order to provide an uninterrupted track of queries over incoming input distributed data streams. More than a few stream processing engines exists to handle these distributed streaming applications. These distributed applications have open challenges like backpressure. In this paper, we introduce a backpressure mitigation mechanism for the distributed stream processing systems. The proposed backpressure mitigation technique is a generic one and is feasible to be implemented on top of a number of popular streaming frameworks. We use Flink as a testbed for this work and use its available APIs.", "venue": "International Conference on Information Networking", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2020-01-01", "journal": {"name": "2020 International Conference on Information Networking (ICOIN)", "pages": "713-716"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "145917478", "name": "Muhammad Hanif"}, {"authorId": "121038995", "name": "Hyeongdeok Yoon"}, {"authorId": "92671954", "name": "Choonhwa Lee"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "0663c53cca69d69b10f85e1d832b974eeee0ff47", "title": "Performance Evaluation Analysis of Spark Streaming Backpressure for Data-Intensive Pipelines"}]}
