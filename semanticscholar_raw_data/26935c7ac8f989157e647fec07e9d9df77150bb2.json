In our present work, we explore methods for collecting and distributing information among participants by employing collaboratively-built high-definition maps that contain fine-grained contextual data. We leverage a hierarchical federated learning structure and anticipatory onboarding of the maps through a mobility-aware content caching scheme and minimize the delay of data delivery in both subsystems. We provide analytical models built on queuing theory and integer linear programming and evaluate essential system parameters in an emulation testbed. Based on our results, we conclude that we can significantly reduce the delay in delivering timely information to vehicular clients by introducing intermediary layers in the federated learning structure and by pre-loading current map tiles corresponding to vehicle paths.", "venue": "IEEE/IFIP Network Operations and Management Symposium", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-05-08", "journal": {"name": "NOMS 2023-2023 IEEE/IFIP Network Operations and Management Symposium", "pages": "1-6"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2955111", "name": "L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Toka"}, {"authorId": "2220365735", "name": "M\u00e1rk Konr\u00e1d"}, {"authorId": "2325913", "name": "Istv\u00e1n Pelle"}, {"authorId": "1771457", "name": "Bal\u00e1zs Sonkoly"}, {"authorId": "2220361937", "name": "Marcell Szab\u00f3"}, {"authorId": "2220360020", "name": "Bhavishya Sharma"}, {"authorId": "38179236", "name": "Shashwat Kumar"}, {"authorId": "2190513552", "name": "Madhuri Annavazzala"}, {"authorId": "2220365834", "name": "Sree Teja Deekshitula"}, {"authorId": "1700999303", "name": "A.
