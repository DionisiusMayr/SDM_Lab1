HARVEST is built using open-source systems specifically designed for big data applications to efficiently ingest and process real-world measurements collected in real-time from sensors located in different areas of Greece. The results from the analysis benefit not only the farmers but also additional roles in smart agriculture, such as data analysts and sensor infrastructure operators. HARVEST encapsulates advanced analytics to fill missing measurements, detect malfunctioning sensors and produce meaningful insights to support decision-making thus departing from common data warehousing deployments.", "venue": "EDBT/ICDT Workshops", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "1998030578", "name": "Ioannis Mavroudopoulos"}, {"authorId": "68972826", "name": "Theodoros Toliopoulos"}, {"authorId": "1698942", "name": "A.
