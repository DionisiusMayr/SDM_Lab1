Geoportal systems are deployed as web-based systems that provide access to spatial data and represent an important tool for analyzing spatial information in real time. As part of the report, it was proposed to increase the efficiency of solving management problems in territorial systems through the introduction of planning, identification, analysis, monitoring and risk management processes in project activities for the development of geoportals. Examples of project implementation of risk-oriented geoportal systems systematizing knowledge about regional natural-social-production systems are proposed.", "venue": "International Conference on Collaboration Technologies and Systems", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-09-21", "journal": {"name": "2023 V International Conference on Control in Technical Systems (CTS)", "pages": "28-31"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "52344810", "name": "S.
