The type of study is mixed and applied with a quasi-experimental design. An analytical system based on eight stages was built, which are: user characterization, business requirements, storage, technological infrastructure, feature engineering, computational processing, visualization and decision making. The analytical system was validated with data from the SQL Server management system of the academic services office and fifteen Excel files from the admission office oriented to academic data in a higher educational institution. The use of various algorithms such as support vector machine, random forest, k nearest neighbours, and neural networks, among others, was applied. The evaluation of the results generated by these algorithms allowed us to identify the support vector machine algorithm with 94.21% accuracy.", "venue": "2022 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies on Education & Research (ICALTER)", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-11-16", "journal": {"name": "2022 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies on Education & Research (ICALTER)", "pages": "1-4"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2044579589", "name": "R.
