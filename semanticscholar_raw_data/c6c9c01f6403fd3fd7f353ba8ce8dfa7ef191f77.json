We evaluated whether remote unsupervised webcam recordings of finger\u2010tapping were associated with cognitive performance in older adults. METHODS A total of 404 cognitively\u2010asymptomatic participants (64.6 [6.77] years; 70.8% female) completed 10\u2010second finger\u2010tapping tests (Tasmanian [TAS] Test) and cognitive tests (Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery [CANTAB]) online at home. Regression models including hand movement features were compared with null models (comprising age, sex, and education level); change in Akaike Information Criterion greater than 2 (\u0394AIC > 2) denoted statistical difference. RESULTS Hand movement features improved prediction of episodic memory, executive function, and working memory scores (\u0394AIC > 2). Dominant hand features outperformed nondominant hand features for episodic memory (\u0394AIC = 2.5), executive function (\u0394AIC = 4.8), and working memory (\u0394AIC = 2.2). DISCUSSION This brief webcam test improved prediction of cognitive performance compared to age, sex, and education. Finger\u2010tapping holds potential as a remote language\u2010agnostic screening tool to stratify community cohorts at risk for cognitive decline.", "venue": "Alzheimer's & Dementia", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-01-01", "journal": {"name": "Alzheimer's & Dementia : Diagnosis, Assessment & Disease Monitoring", "volume": "16"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2143498408", "name": "Renjie Li"}, {"authorId": "2144708134", "name": "Xinyi Wang"}, {"authorId": "2250335575", "name": "Katherine Lawler"}, {"authorId": "2150497667", "name": "Saurabh Garg"}, {"authorId": "12859794", "name": "Rebecca J.
