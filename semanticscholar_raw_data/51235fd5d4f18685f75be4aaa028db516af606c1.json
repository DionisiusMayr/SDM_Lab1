The proposed algorithm mimics the behavior of spiders in nature and mathematically models its hunting strategies: search, persecution, and jumping skills to get the prey. These strategies provide a fine balance between exploitation and exploration over the solution search space and solve global optimization problems. JSOA is tested with 20 well-known testbench mathematical problems taken from the literature. Further studies include the tuning of a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller, the Selective harmonic elimination problem, and a few real-world single objective bound-constrained numerical optimization problems taken from CEC 2020. Additionally, the JSOA\u2019s performance is tested against several well-known bio-inspired algorithms taken from the literature. The statistical results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms recent literature algorithms and is capable to solve challenging real-world problems with unknown search space.", "venue": "Mathematics", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2021-12-29", "journal": {"name": "Mathematics"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1411510888", "name": "H.
