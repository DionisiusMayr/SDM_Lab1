The main objective of this paper is to describe the basic skyline query algorithm and its application to the recommendation system. The method that is used in this research is the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method. The SLR method consisted of procedures to cluster and classify specific algorithms issue, to integrate and evaluate focal key point from previous research, and to claim previously unknown research gap for future works. The result of this research shows the emergence of an idea to create a real time recommendation system for individual preferences based on very large dataset both numeric and labeled data by using skyline queries, particularly in form of streaming data and the existence of complexity of the algorithm to concern dealing current and future challenges.", "venue": "2020 International Conference on Computer Science and Its Application in Agriculture (ICOSICA)", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2020-09-16", "journal": {"name": "2020 International Conference on Computer Science and Its Application in Agriculture (ICOSICA)", "pages": "1-7"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "145401040", "name": "Ruhul Amin"}, {"authorId": "2331614", "name": "Taufik Djatna"}, {"authorId": "2075678116", "name": "Annisa"}, {"authorId": "3007650", "name": "I.
