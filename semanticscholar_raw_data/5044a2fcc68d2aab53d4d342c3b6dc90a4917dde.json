IoT has many security issues which make IoT systems very vulnerable to the attackers. Recently, there have been many DDoS attacks using IoT devices opening the possibility of DDoS attacks on the IoT systems vastly. DDoS attacks have not been able to affect the lives of people directly. But with IoT systems as their target, attackers can cause serious impact on the lives of people. So, the DDoS vulnerability of IoT systems need to be addressed so that proper solutions can be created for IoT.", "venue": "Journal of scientific research", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "JOURNAL OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2141589632", "name": "N.
