IoT as understood today has the challenge of varied standards, architectures and models by referring the corporate that develops different applications. But, to evaluate and benchmark the security aspects of the designed IoT application, a single methodology cannot be followed, as each of those are developed based on a different architecture. Hence, a survey is undertaken to study all the security frameworks proposed by researchers, industry and those which are just conceptual. This paper discusses about various IoT architectures, security attacks possible on layers, protocols and devices of an IoT system and finally a comprehensive survey is performed on all the security frameworks of IoT systems. Further, they are classified based on the focus or the thrust area in developing the same. Finally, this survey work is concluded by comparing the security frameworks based on few important metrics and by suggesting the required improvements in designing a generic security framework that handles majority of shortcomings in the present frameworks and practices.", "venue": "2020 Third International Conference on Smart Systems and Inventive Technology (ICSSIT)", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2020-08-01", "journal": {"name": "2020 Third International Conference on Smart Systems and Inventive Technology (ICSSIT)", "pages": "339-345"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "51244884", "name": "Vadiraja Acharya"}, {"authorId": "49297176", "name": "Vinay V.
