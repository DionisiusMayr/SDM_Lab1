Innovations led by digital transformations in the agri-food supply chains (AFSCs) are the main aim of \u2018Agri-Food 4.0\u2019. This brings significant transformations in the agri-food sector by reducing food wastage, real-time product monitoring, reducing scalability issues, etc. This paper presents a systematic review of the innovations in the agri-food for digital technologies such as internet-of-things, artificial intelligence, big data, RFID, robotics, block-chain technology, etc. The employment of these technologies from the \u2018farm to fork\u2019 along AFSC emphasizes a review of 159 articles solicited from different sources. This paper also highlights digitization in developing smart, sensible, and sustainable agri-food supply chain systems.", "venue": "Production Engineering Archives", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2021-06-01", "journal": {"name": "Production Engineering Archives", "pages": "75 - 89", "volume": "27"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2111666467", "name": "Vasavi Dadi"}, {"authorId": "2111666552", "name": "Suryadevara Ram Nikhil"}, {"authorId": "152505495", "name": "R.
