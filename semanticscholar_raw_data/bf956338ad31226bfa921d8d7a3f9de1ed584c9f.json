Jevtic and Lanchier[20] proposed a dynamic structural model of aggregate loss distribution for cyber risk of small-and-medium-sized enterprises under the assumption of a tree-based local-area-network topology that consists of the combination of a Poisson process, homogeneous random trees, bond percolation processes, and cost topology. Their model assumes that the contagion spreads through the edges of the network with the same fixed probability in both directions, thus overlooking a dynamic cyber security environment implemented in most networks, and their results give an exact expression for the mean of the aggregate loss but only a rough upper bound for the variance. In this paper, we consider a bidirectional version of their percolation model in which the contagion spreads through the edges of the network with a certain probability moving toward the lower level assets of the network but with another probability moving toward the higher level assets of the network. Also, our different\u00a0mathematical approach\u00a0leads to exact expressions for both the mean and the variance of the aggregate loss, and therefore an exact expression for the insurance premiums.", "venue": "Mathematical Modelling of Natural Phenomena", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Mathematics"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2021-10-17", "journal": {"name": "Mathematical Modelling of Natural Phenomena"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "148024570", "name": "Stefano Chiaradonna"}, {"authorId": "3365931", "name": "N.
