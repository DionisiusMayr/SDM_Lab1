In this work, we present a cloud-based system architecture for advanced electric metering in smart cities, whose purpose is to achieve better management of electric energy use by consumers and an efficient balance between demand and consumption by utilities. In our approach, in addition to energy consumption data (kilowatt-hour), other electrical parameters (e.g., current, power factor, active and reactive power) are collected in real-time from smart meters for storage and deeper analyses in a big data ecosystem. Moreover, we introduce the smart gateway (sGateway), a component of the system architecture to provide local processing and to simplify the communication between smart meters and the cloud processing system.", "venue": "IEEE Annual Information Technology, Electronics and Mobile Communication Conference", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2019-10-01", "journal": {"name": "2019 IEEE 10th Annual Information Technology, Electronics and Mobile Communication Conference (IEMCON)", "pages": "1087-1091"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "38380768", "name": "F.
