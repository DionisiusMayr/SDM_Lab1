As our main result, we show the existence of hard functions that are essentially not parallelizable in the MPC model. Based on the widely-used random oracle methodology in cryptography with a cryptographic hash function h:{0,1}n \u2192 {0,1}n computable in time th, we show that there exists a function that can be computed in time O(T \u00b7 th) and space S by a RAM algorithm, but any MPC algorithm with local memory size s < S/c for some c>1 requires at least ~\u03a9(T) rounds to compute the function, even in the average case, for a wide range of parameters n \u2264 S \u2264 T \u2264 2n1/4. Our result is almost optimal in the sense that by taking T to be much larger than th,e.g., T to be sub-exponential in th, to compute the function, the round complexity of any MPC algorithm with small local memory size is asymptotically the same (up to a polylogarithmic factor) as the time complexity of the RAM algorithm. Our result is obtained by adapting the so-called compression argument from the data structure lower bounds and cryptography literature to the context of massively parallel computation.", "venue": "ACM Symposium on Parallelism in Algorithms and Architectures", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2020-07-06", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 32nd ACM Symposium on Parallelism in Algorithms and Architectures"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "40357578", "name": "Kai-Min Chung"}, {"authorId": "47702038", "name": "Kuan-Yi Ho"}, {"authorId": "1743608", "name": "Xiaorui Sun"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "a8b26718d629024b1823b36a3b4881b8c4a6dc26", "title": "Equivalence classes and conditional hardness in massively parallel computations"}]}
