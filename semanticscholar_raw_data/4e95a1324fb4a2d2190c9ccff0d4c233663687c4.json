We are interested in how human and automated anomaly detection can be combined in the most beneficial way to improve how fault detection is practiced in building maintenance. Open source datasets with sensor data were annotated by persons with low subject matter experience, and compared with a Convolutional Autoencoder Neural Network (CAE) as well as a dedicated time series algorithm (DeepAnT), and detection metrics of human and algorithmic procedures are compared. Future comparisons will include higher levels of expertise on the human side, and more sophistication/training amount on the algorithm side. We close by discussing the advantages and caveats of our approach.", "venue": "International Conference on Big Data Computing Service and Applications", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-08-01", "journal": {"name": "2022 IEEE Eighth International Conference on Big Data Computing Service and Applications (BigDataService)", "pages": "155-160"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "51935577", "name": "Reuben Borrison"}, {"authorId": "20443084", "name": "Marc Syndicus"}, {"authorId": "2186357955", "name": "Andre Orth"}, {"authorId": "145180044", "name": "Romana Markovic"}, {"authorId": "35539201", "name": "Marcel Dix"}, {"authorId": "2059151508", "name": "Antonio Liguori"}, {"authorId": "2186356624", "name": "Matthias Berning"}, {"authorId": "2160823986", "name": "Andreas Wagner"}, {"authorId": "2726949", "name": "C.
