However, with the increasing ability to collect and store detailed criminal event tracking data, a significant amount of data with spatial and temporal information is obtained daily. Intelligent computer systems have been playing a vital role in improving the results of criminal investigations and detections, facilitating analysis and sharing of information. Objective To identify, characterize and meta-analyze the approaches and intelligent algorithms used to discover patterns on criminal incident data. Method A quantitative systematic review (with meta-analysis) was performed. Results 38.53% of the selected studies used Unsupervised Machine Learning, 30.28% used Supervised Machine Learning and 17.43% used Association rules. Regarding algorithms, K-Means (14.39%), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) (11.36%) and Apriori (9.85%) are among the most widely used. Conclusion Only three studies could be selected for meta-analysis, observing the Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine algorithms. Being a global problem, the criminal area has attracted the attention of many researchers and scientists around the world. In addition, the Government Open Data phenomenon has facilitated access to data, providing a considerable increase in research in this area.", "venue": "Journal of Applied Security Research", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Political Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2020-01-25", "journal": {"name": "Journal of Applied Security Research", "pages": "297 - 331", "volume": "15"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1861909880", "name": "Kleber Henrique de Jesus Prado"}, {"authorId": "2127262529", "name": "Layse Santos Souza"}, {"authorId": "2127249510", "name": "Israel Dias de Jesus Junior"}, {"authorId": "2125663859", "name": "Methanias Cola\u00e7o J\u00fanior"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "80028fc5c4c750d6c7c841e81d00d9462bc71255", "title": "A graph neural network-enhanced knowledge graph framework for intelligent analysis of policing cases."}, {"paperId": "e4775415e55f729af347a00ebb9b7124b2714a0a", "title": "Survey of Text Mining Techniques Applied to Judicial Decisions Prediction"}, {"paperId": "9c089444e05399d256bb33ac7ac62df55da3696b", "title": "Data Science Applied to Crime Analysis Based on Brazilian Open Government Data"}, {"paperId": "87bf9ec345dd5cee04608aa122b30bf61512601b", "title": "Exquisite Analysis of Popular Machine Learning\u2013Based Phishing Detection Techniques for Cyber Systems"}]}
