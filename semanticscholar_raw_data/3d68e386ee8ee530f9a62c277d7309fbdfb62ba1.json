In the proposed data analytic framework, the following aspects are considered. (1) Data with core characteristics do not have core characteristics of large sample data and we cannot use the existing methods to draw meaningful conclusions. (2) The multidimensional IRT observation score equivalent is obtained by converting the node value of each dimension capability in multidimensional test to the one-dimensional capability node value. (3) The decision algorithm accurately completely describes inference relationship between the condition attribute and the decision attribute in decision table. With these mentioned novelties, we conduct the analysis on the tibetan traditional motion feature analysis and the classifications. The experimental results prove that we can obtain a better performance using the proposed paradigm.", "venue": "2019 Third International conference on I-SMAC (IoT in Social, Mobile, Analytics and Cloud) (I-SMAC)", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2019-12-01", "journal": {"name": "2019 Third International conference on I-SMAC (IoT in Social, Mobile, Analytics and Cloud) (I-SMAC)", "pages": "24-28"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1561681333", "name": "Bingsong Zhang"}, {"authorId": "1564597519", "name": "Zhaoying Xiang"}, {"authorId": "152762543", "name": "Zhixiang Pan"}, {"authorId": "2152688135", "name": "Bo Chen"}], "citations": []}
