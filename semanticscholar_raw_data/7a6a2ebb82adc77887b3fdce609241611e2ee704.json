In the heterogeneous database scenario, the effectiveness of SQL statement optimization rules needs to be further explored. Connect the relational heterogeneous database through Calcite, and use predicate push down, constant transfer and sub-query de-nesting rules to optimize SQL statements. The experiment shows that the optimized SQL statement can effectively shorten the execution time in the scenario of relational heterogeneous database.", "venue": "Other Conferences", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-06-26", "journal": {"pages": "127210Q - 127210Q-8", "volume": "12721"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2218245101", "name": "Yanming Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2220684940", "name": "Wenjie Zhao"}], "citations": []}
