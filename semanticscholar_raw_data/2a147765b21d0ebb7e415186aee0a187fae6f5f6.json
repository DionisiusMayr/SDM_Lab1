The ability to start a simulation based on the current situation of the system in real-time is central for these systems. In this paper, we present our system architecture that combines a real-time digital twin of logistics systems with simulation logic in a single (modularized) model. This combination not only reduces offline work creating and maintaining such a model and decision support system but also reduces runtime in this critical real-time use-case. The approach is demonstrated in two industrial use cases.", "venue": "2018 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2018-12-01", "journal": {"name": "2018 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "pages": "4194-4201"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2046961157", "name": "Benjamin Korth"}, {"authorId": "2432044", "name": "C.
