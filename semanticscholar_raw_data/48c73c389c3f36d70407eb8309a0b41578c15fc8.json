However, today\u2019s quantum computers are error \u2010 prone and have limited capabilities. This leads to various challenges when developing and executing quantum algorithms, for example, the mitigation of occurring errors or the selection of a suitable quantum computer to execute a certain quantum circuit. To address these challenges, detailed information about the quantum circuit to be executed as well as past executions, and the up \u2010 to \u2010 date information about the available quantum computers are required. Thus, this data must be continuously collected and stored in the long \u2010 term, which is currently not supported. To overcome this problem, a provenance approach is introduced for quantum computing. Therefore, relevant provenance attributes that should be gathered in the area of quantum computing are identified. Furthermore, QProv, a provenance system that automatically collects the identified provenance attributes and provides them in a uniform manner to the user is introduced. Finally, a case study with the collected provenance data and corresponding use cases that can benefit from this provenance data are presented here.", "venue": "IET Quantum Communication", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-06-17", "journal": {"name": "IET Quantum Commun.", "pages": "171-181", "volume": "2"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1474569575", "name": "Benjamin Weder"}, {"authorId": "2890261", "name": "Johanna Barzen"}, {"authorId": "1688415", "name": "F.
