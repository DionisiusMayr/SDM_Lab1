Learning disorders are a disease that affects learning skills. The person with learning difficulties also understands, accept and recognize things in different ways. This can lead to problems learning new knowledge, skills and placing them into practice. It is therefore important to build a framework that can accurately recognize learning disabilities. This research goal is to perform Multilayer Perceptron of deep learning methods for predicting learning disorders (LD).", "venue": "International Conferences on Intelligent Systems, Metaheuristics & Swarm Intelligence", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-04-10", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 2021 5th International Conference on Intelligent Systems, Metaheuristics & Swarm Intelligence"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "70437268", "name": "Poonam Dhamal"}, {"authorId": "9102852", "name": "S.
