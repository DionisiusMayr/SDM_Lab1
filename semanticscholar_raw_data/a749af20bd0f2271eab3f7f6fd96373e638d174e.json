Examples of big data come from Internet of Things (IoT) devices, as well as smart cars, but also the use of social networks, industries, and so on. The sources of data are numerous and continuously increasing, and, therefore, what characterizes big data is not only the volume but also the complexity due to the heterogeneity of information that can be obtained. The fastest growth in spending on big data technologies is happening within banking, healthcare, insurance, securities and investment services, and telecommunications. Remarkably, three of those industries lie within the financial sector, which has many particularly serviceable use cases for big data analytics, such as fraud detection, risk management, and customer service optimization. In fact, the definition of big data analysis refers to the process that encompasses the gathering and analysis of big data to obtain useful information for the business. This paper focuses on delivering a short review concerning the current technologies, future perspectives, and the evaluation of some use cased associated with the analysis of big data.", "venue": "Bulletin of Electrical Engineering and Informatics", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2020-08-01", "journal": {"name": "Bulletin of Electrical Engineering and Informatics"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "153660505", "name": "Fabio Arena"}, {"authorId": "1702366", "name": "G.
