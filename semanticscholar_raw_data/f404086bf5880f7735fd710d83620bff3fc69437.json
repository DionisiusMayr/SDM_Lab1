The framework integrates smart digital health solutions with latency-aware edge computing autoscaling, providing a novel approach to remote patient monitoring. By leveraging IoT technology and application autoscaling, the \u201cSDH\u201d enables the real-time tracking of critical health parameters, such as ECG, body temperature, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation. These vital metrics are efficiently transmitted in real time to AWS cloud storage through a layered networking architecture. The contributions are two-fold: (1) establishing real-time remote patient monitoring and (2) developing a scalable architecture that features latency-aware horizontal pod autoscaling for containerized healthcare applications. The architecture incorporates a scalable IoT-based architecture and an innovative microservice autoscaling strategy in edge computing, driven by dynamic latency thresholds and enhanced by the integration of custom metrics. This work ensures heightened accessibility, cost-efficiency, and rapid responsiveness to patient needs, marking a significant leap forward in the field. By dynamically adjusting pod numbers based on latency, the system optimizes system responsiveness, particularly in edge computing\u2019s proximity-based processing. This innovative fusion of technologies not only revolutionizes remote healthcare delivery but also enhances Kubernetes performance, preventing unresponsiveness during high usage.", "venue": "Italian National Conference on Sensors", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-02-01", "journal": {"name": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "volume": "24"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "51287181", "name": "Hisham Alasmary"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "ceb128e1cdc84fb7ae4871ec604186a76c3fb3ab", "title": "Secure Computing for Fog-Enabled Industrial IoT"}]}
