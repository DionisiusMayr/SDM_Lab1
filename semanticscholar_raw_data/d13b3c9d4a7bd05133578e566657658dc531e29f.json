However, query-driven learned cardinality estimators are dependent on sample workloads, requiring vast amounts of labeled queries. Further, we show that state-of-the-art query-driven techniques can make significant and unpredictable errors on queries that are outside the distribution of their training set. We show that these out-of-distribution errors can be mitigated by incorporating the \\emph{domain knowledge} used in traditional query optimizers: \\emph{constraints} on values and cardinalities (e.g., based on key-foreign-key relationships, range predicates, and more generally on inclusion and functional dependencies). We develop methods for \\emph{semi-supervised} query-driven learned query optimization, based on constraints, and we experimentally demonstrate that such techniques can increase a learned query optimizer's accuracy in cardinality estimation, reduce the reliance on massive labeled queries, and improve the robustness of query end-to-end performance.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-12-02", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2312.01025"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2269520572", "name": "Peizhi Wu"}, {"authorId": "2269463351", "name": "Ryan Marcus"}, {"authorId": "1804315", "name": "Z.
