The continuous growth of data storage pressure drives the rapid development of the entire storage market on account of massive data generated. By providing data storage and management, cloud storage system becomes an indispensable part of the new era. Currently, the governments, enterprises and individual users are actively migrating their data to the cloud. Such a huge amount of data can create magnanimous wealth. However, this increases the possible risk, for instance, unauthorized access, data leakage, sensitive information disclosure and privacy disclosure. Although there are some studies on data security and privacy protection, there is still a lack of systematic surveys on the subject in cloud storage system. In this paper, we make a comprehensive review of the literatures on data security and privacy issues, data encryption technology, and applicable countermeasures in cloud storage system. Specifically, we first make an overview of cloud storage, including definition, classification, architecture and applications. Secondly, we give a detailed analysis on challenges and requirements of data security and privacy protection in cloud storage system. Thirdly, data encryption technologies and protection methods are summarized. Finally, we discuss several open research topics of data security for cloud storage.", "venue": "IEEE Access", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "IEEE Access", "pages": "131723-131740", "volume": "8"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2118263792", "name": "Pan Yang"}, {"authorId": "145826495", "name": "N.
