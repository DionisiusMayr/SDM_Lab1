The traditional method of relying on manpower has obvious disadvantages in terms of timeliness and accuracy, while the method of adding specialized equipment brings high costs. To this end, this paper collects and screens voltage data at each node on the basis of existing measurement devices, uses weighted derivative dynamic time warping (WDDTW) distance to describe the similarity between voltage series, and combines hierarchical clustering algorithms to identify the users-transformer connectivity relationship and the phases of non-three-phase devices in low-voltage station area. Through the simulation example including distributed generations (DGs) such as photovoltaic and wind power, the proposed method can automatically update the topology identification results under the consideration of new energy sources, with good accuracy and without increasing cost, and provides a certain reference for solving the topology identification problem of low voltage station area.", "venue": "2023 International Conference on Smart Electrical Grid and Renewable Energy (SEGRE)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-06-01", "journal": {"name": "2023 International Conference on Smart Electrical Grid and Renewable Energy (SEGRE)", "pages": "257-264"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2255547949", "name": "Yifei Liu"}, {"authorId": "2255384951", "name": "Rong Cao"}, {"authorId": "2255826357", "name": "Yufeng Guo"}, {"authorId": "2121357749", "name": "Yingwei Wang"}], "citations": []}
