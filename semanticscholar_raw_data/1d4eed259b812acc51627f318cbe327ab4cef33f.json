As people enjoy the convenience by this AI large model, more and more large models in subdivided fields are gradually being proposed, especially large models in radiology imaging field. This article first introduces the development history of large models, technical details, workflow, working principles of multimodal large models and working principles of video generation large models. Secondly, we summarize the latest research progress of AI large models in radiology education, radiology report generation, applications of unimodal and multimodal radiology. Finally, this paper also summarizes some of the challenges of large AI models in radiology, with the aim of better promoting the rapid revolution in the field of radiography.", "venue": "", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2024-03-24", "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "1825691268", "name": "Liangrui Pan"}, {"authorId": "2293682192", "name": "Zhenyu Zhao"}, {"authorId": "2293323146", "name": "Ying Lu"}, {"authorId": "2293303890", "name": "Kewei Tang"}, {"authorId": "2293359702", "name": "Liyong Fu"}, {"authorId": "2291139657", "name": "Qingchun Liang"}, {"authorId": "2287835710", "name": "Shaoliang Peng"}], "citations": []}
