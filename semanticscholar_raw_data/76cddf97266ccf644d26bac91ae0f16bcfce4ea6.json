The adoption of machine learning and big data techniques has equipped these platforms with the capacity to handle larger amounts of increasingly complex data, transcending the limitations of more traditional approaches. This work traces the historical and technical evolution of data science and GIS as fields of study, highlighting the critical points of convergence between domains, and underlining the many sectors that rely on this integration. A GIS application is presented as a case study in the disaster management sector where we utilize aerial data from Tr\\'oia, Portugal, to emphasize the process of insight extraction from raw data. We conclude by outlining prospects for future research in integration of these fields in general, and the developed application in particular.", "venue": "", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering", "Computer Science", "Physics"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2024-04-04", "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2237952329", "name": "Afonso Oliveira"}, {"authorId": "2286262592", "name": "Nuno Fachada"}, {"authorId": "1413070832", "name": "J.
