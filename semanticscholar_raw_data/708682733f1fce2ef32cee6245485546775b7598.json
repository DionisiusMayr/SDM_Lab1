This paper presents Ariadne, a system for capturing and querying provenance from Vertex-Centric graph processing systems. While the size of provenance from map-reduce-style workflows is often a fraction of the input data size, graph algorithms iterate over the input graph many times, producing provenance much larger than the input graph. And though current provenance tracing procedures support explicit debugging scenarios, like crash-culprit determination, developers are increasingly interested in the behavior of analytics when a crash or exception does not occur. To address this challenge, Ariadne offers developers a concise declarative query language to capture and query graph analytics provenance. Exploiting the formal semantics of this datalog-based language, we identify useful query classes that can run while an analytic computes. Experiments with various analytics and real-world datasets show the overhead of online querying is 1.3x over the baseline vs. 8x for the traditional approach. These experiments also illustrate how Ariadne's query language supports execution monitoring and performance optimization for graph analytics.", "venue": "SIGMOD Conference", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2019-06-25", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 2019 International Conference on Management of Data"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2835399", "name": "Vicky Papavasileiou"}, {"authorId": "1860926", "name": "Ken Yocum"}, {"authorId": "50136367", "name": "Alin Deutsch"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "28e7f8566d50ad666f8e791af1f350a6dbaf3c6e", "title": "INFLUENCE WITH TRAFFIC RATE AND BEACON TIME FOR JAMMING ATTACK ON 802.11B IN MOBILE AD HOC NETWORKS"}, {"paperId": "3984aba05fc6f9a9c61e716e6ada32ab7d281d3c", "title": "Deep learning for track recognition in pixel and strip-based particle detectors"}, {"paperId": "d4587dcd4e7a92b3d6dac371037a26352b5a53a2", "title": "Living a postmodern purgatory: Death anxiety in Russian Doll"}, {"paperId": "9e6301bd0e45b6a0598afae599592a03d1205a62", "title": "Social data provenance framework based on zero-information loss graph database"}, {"paperId": "81f223554aaffeb5bdda90b76198fe932b5b51f3", "title": "Smartphone Use Side-by-Side with Burnout: Mediation of Work\u2013Family Interaction and Loneliness"}, {"paperId": "2c3b8ac6534539f20434d3577e42cedef61d8060", "title": "Feminist literary revisionism and the #MeToo movement"}, {"paperId": "780c0629ede0e173f3d885e76ac81f446b75c7da", "title": "Big social data provenance framework for Zero-Information Loss Key-Value Pair (KVP) Database"}, {"paperId": "5e1e39e4b8ed349367eb597e68a664994920a4b7", "title": "Ariadne: PyTorch library for particle track reconstruction using deep learning"}, {"paperId": "9664a7216a3cf27ebd707f9ce2261d212c6e7868", "title": "High-quality axions in solutions to the \n\u03bc\n problem"}, {"paperId": "039552a031dfaedb7b6f1d7560d6104406165dd5", "title": "Provenance Framework for Twitter Data using Zero-Information Loss Graph Database"}, {"paperId": "e71d80dc94d62957526340ecdd8c900cef29ef8f", "title": "Light dark matter from inflaton decay"}, {"paperId": "588dced9f09a5e0f8efd411c5e611d288dbea693", "title": "Professionals\u2019 and Students\u2019 Perceived Needs for an Online Supportive Application for Reducing School Absence and Stimulating Reintegration: Concept Mapping Study (Preprint)"}, {"paperId": "63888b2e84751967cba543bf1dd367956e7fe1ea", "title": "A Graph Database Storage Engine for Provenance Graphs"}, {"paperId": "3160943e1560517e19138a87cd03c24f92f3bc20", "title": "Gender Influence on Students, Parents, and Teachers\u2019 Perceptions of What Children and Adolescents in Germany Need to Cycle to School: A Concept Mapping Study"}, {"paperId": "a0d75ecd2bb7fe52c175355de33176431ebfeb44", "title": "Debugging Database Queries: A Survey of Tools, Techniques, and Users"}, {"paperId": "ba7e3767594d2dcefcde605b43f823f783dbd5a0", "title": "GraphM: an efficient storage system for high throughput of concurrent graph processing"}, {"paperId": "53cfef95111cdbf089210818ceb220c71e12fe4f", "title": "Fifty Years Is Not a Lot of Time!"}, {"paperId": "d22dec30f0acb2aae3a8733bc9f5d9b40aa37adf", "title": "Absence of Spurious Local Trajectories in Time-Varying Optimization: A Control-Theoretic Perspective"}, {"paperId": "8486b9ae75b0b2daa9df4e1869518be5f6b45ff3", "title": "In and Out of the Nation"}, {"paperId": "7256674fac123e5473957a98f71a3769d8887384", "title": "\u201eGespr\u00e4che mit Dionysos\u201c.
