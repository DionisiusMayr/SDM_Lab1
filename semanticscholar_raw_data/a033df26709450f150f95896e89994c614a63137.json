At the same time, its energy consumption affects the operation cost and system reliability, and this attracts the attention of architecture designers and researchers. In order to solve the problem of energy in heterogeneous system environment, inspired by the results of 0-1 programming, a scheduling method of heuristic and greedy energy saving (HGES) approach is proposed to allocate tasks reasonably to achieve the purpose of energy saving. Firstly, all tasks are assigned to each GPU in the system, and then the tasks are divided into high-value tasks and low-value tasks by the calculated average time value and variance value of all tasks. By using the greedy method, the high-value tasks are assigned first, and then the low-value tasks are allocated. In order to verify the effectiveness and rationality of HGES, different tasks with different inputs and different comparison methods are designed and tested. The experimental results on different platforms show that the HGES has better energy saving than that of existing method and can get result faster than that of the 0-1 programming.", "venue": "Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-06-26", "journal": {"name": "Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience", "volume": "2022"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2679297", "name": "Junke Li"}, {"authorId": "2081079976", "name": "Bing Guo"}, {"authorId": "49599759", "name": "Kai Liu"}, {"authorId": "1390631892", "name": "Jincheng Zhou"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "c92b5308db693307e1f880c3a301eafab3713437", "title": "The Optimal Path for China to Achieve the \u201cDual Carbon\u201d Target from the Perspective of Energy Structure Optimization"}]}
