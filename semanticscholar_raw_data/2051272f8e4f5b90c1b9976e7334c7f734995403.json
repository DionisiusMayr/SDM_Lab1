As a result, a complex and dynamic network with a vulnerability inherited from the Internet becomes an attractive target for hackers to attack critical infrastructures. Therefore, this paper selects three potential attacks with the evaluation of the protections, namely (1) distributed denial of service (DDoS), (2) address resolution protocol (ARP) spoofing, and (3) Internet protocol (IP) fragmentation attacks. In the DDoS protection, the F1-score, accuracy, precision, and recall of the four-feature random forest with principal component analysis (RFPCA) model are 95.65%, 97%, 97.06%, and 94.29%, respectively. In the ARP spoofing, a batch processing method adopts the entropy calculated in the 20 s window with sensitivity to network abnormalities detection of various ARP spoofing scenarios involving victims\u2019 traffic. The detected attacker\u2019s MAC address is inserted in the block list to filter malicious traffic. The proposed protection in the IP fragmentation attack is implementing one-time code (OTC) and timestamp fields in the packet header. The simulation shows that the method detected 160 fake fragments from attackers among 2040 fragments.", "venue": "Syst.", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-04-20", "journal": {"name": "Syst.", "pages": "211", "volume": "11"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2150505511", "name": "Tze Uei Chai"}, {"authorId": "2949858", "name": "H.
