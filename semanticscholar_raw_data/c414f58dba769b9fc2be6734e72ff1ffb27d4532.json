It enables devices to connect to the internet via sensors, drones, satellites, and so on. Agriculture is critical to the economy of any country. With the world\u2019s population growing, traditional agricultural methods are finding it hard to fulfill the world\u2019s food needs. It is the need of the hour to incorporate IoT in agriculture to digitalize the farming methods to increase the production level. IoT-based modernization in agriculture helps the farmers to check soil moisture, humidity, water level, climate conditions, crop production, etc. IoT applications also promise to maximize the comfort level and efficiency and offer automation to the farmers. With rising cyber-attacks on IoT, smart devices need better security, confidentiality, integrity, and recovery from attacks. In this review, our main focus is on the security challenges faced by resource constraints, low storage, and low power devices. The basic security requirements for IoT devices in smart agriculture are briefly reviewed. Some state-of-the-art security technologies are explored, including machine learning, fog computing, edge computing, SDN, and Blockchains. This analysis of security concerns and security measures will give future scholars a research direction.", "venue": "International Conference on Software Security and Assurance", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-07-26", "journal": {"name": "2022 4th International Conference on Smart Sensors and Application (ICSSA)", "pages": "102-107"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2064087617", "name": "A.
