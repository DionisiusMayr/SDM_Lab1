Evaluations have revealed that factors such as scaling, training types, architectures and other factors profoundly impact the performance of LLMs. However, the extent and nature of these impacts continue to be subjects of debate because most assessments have been restricted to a limited number of models and data points. Clarifying the effects of these factors on performance scores can be more effectively achieved through a statistical lens. Our study embarks on a thorough re-examination of these LLMs, targeting the inadequacies in current evaluation methods. With the advent of a uniform evaluation framework, our research leverages an expansive dataset of evaluation results, introducing a comprehensive statistical methodology. This includes the application of ANOVA, Tukey HSD tests, GAMM, and clustering technique, offering a robust and transparent approach to deciphering LLM performance data. Contrary to prevailing findings, our results challenge assumptions about emergent abilities and the influence of given training types and architectures in LLMs. These findings furnish new perspectives on the characteristics, intrinsic nature, and developmental trajectories of LLMs. By providing straightforward and reliable methods to scrutinize and reassess LLM performance data, this study contributes a nuanced perspective on LLM efficiency and potentials.", "venue": "", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2024-03-22", "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2293664568", "name": "Kun Sun"}, {"authorId": "2155889534", "name": "Rong Wang"}, {"authorId": "2293222413", "name": "Haitao Liu"}, {"authorId": "2293169924", "name": "Anders Sogaard"}], "citations": []}
