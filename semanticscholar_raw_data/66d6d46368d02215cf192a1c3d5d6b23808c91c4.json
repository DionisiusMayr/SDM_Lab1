With the increase in the volume of exchanged data, IoT networks\u2019 security has become a crucial issue. Anomaly-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) using machine learning have recently gained increased popularity due to their generation\u2019s ability to detect unseen attacks. However, the deployment of anomaly-based AI-assisted IDS for IoT devices is computationally expensive. A high-performance and ultra-low power consumption anomaly-based IDS framework is proposed and evaluated in this paper. The framework has achieved the highest accuracy of 98.57% and 99.66% on the UNSW-NB15 and IoT-23 datasets, respectively. The inference engine on the MAX78000EVKIT AI-microcontroller is 11.3 times faster than the Intel Core i7-9750H 2.6 GHz and 21.3 times faster than NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 graphics cards, when the power drawn was 18mW. In addition, the pipelined design on the PYNQ-Z2 SoC FPGA board with the Xilinx Zynq xc7z020-1clg400c device is optimised to run at the on-chip frequency (100 MHz), which shows a speedup of 53.5 times compared to the MAX78000EVKIT.", "venue": "Future Internet", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-12-26", "journal": {"name": "Future Internet", "pages": "9", "volume": "15"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1409278704", "name": "Duc-Minh Ngo"}, {"authorId": "2177461968", "name": "Dominic Lightbody"}, {"authorId": "153027989", "name": "A.
