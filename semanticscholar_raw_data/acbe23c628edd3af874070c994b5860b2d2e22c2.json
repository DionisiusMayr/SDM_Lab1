The internet has grown from a simple network of networks to a cyber and physical entity that encompasses the entire planet. Cyber-physical systems(CPS) now control most of the day to day operations of human civilization from autonomous cars to nuclear energy plants. While phenomenal, this growth spurt has created new security threats. These are threats that cannot be blocked by a firewall for they are not only cyber but cyber-physical. In light of these new cyber-physical threats, this text proposes a security measure that promises to enhance the security of cyber-physical systems. Using theoretical cyber, physical, and cyber-physical attack scenarios, this text will highlight the need for some sort of monitor in cyber-physical systems as an extra security measure. Additionally, this text will illustrate the efficiency of said monitor using a Shannon entropy proof, and a multiple security domain nondeducibility(MSDND) proof.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2018-05-05", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/1805.01975"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "46178214", "name": "J.
