The large amounts of unfiltered information returned by an internet query calls for filters able to validate and rank the available options. Recommender systems (RSs) are a software tool designed to qualify the options available and make suggestions that align with the user's requirements and expectations. This paper reviews some significant applications of RSS in various areas like videos, music, eCommerce sites, news, and many more. It also reviews various filtering techniques like collaborative, content based, and hybrid.", "venue": "Information Resources Management Journal", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2020-10-01", "journal": {"name": "Inf.
