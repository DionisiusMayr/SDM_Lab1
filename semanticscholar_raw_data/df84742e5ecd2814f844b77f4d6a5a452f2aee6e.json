The database community has pioneered many novel techniques for Approximate Query Processing (AQP) that could give approximate results in a fraction of time needed for computing exact results. In this work, we explore the usage of deep learning (DL) for answering aggregate queries specifically for interactive applications such as data exploration and visualization. We use deep generative models, an unsupervised learning based approach, to learn the data distribution faithfully such that aggregate queries could be answered approximately by generating samples from the learned model. The model is often compact - few hundred KBs - so that arbitrary AQP queries could be answered on the client side without contacting the database server. Our other contributions include identifying model bias and minimizing it through a rejection sampling based approach and an algorithm to build model ensembles for AQP for improved accuracy. Our extensive experiments show that our proposed approach can provide answers with high accuracy and low latency.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2019-03-24", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/1903.10000"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2934941", "name": "Saravanan Thirumuruganathan"}, {"authorId": "41177504", "name": "Shohedul Hasan"}, {"authorId": "1721062", "name": "Nick Koudas"}, {"authorId": "145080425", "name": "Gautam Das"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "a187e238e6baedb3ee6a986baedf457ea095a8a2", "title": "Tabular Data Synthesis with GANs for Adaptive AI Models"}, {"paperId": "fae724e55340da540a1284a1cf9f409ee2e0ea1c", "title": "Synthetic Data Generation for Enterprise DBMS"}, {"paperId": "6c47bfbab4d5ac95bcf3158e16e9471f92b7fb05", "title": "Model Joins: Enabling Analytics Over Joins of Absent Big Tables"}, {"paperId": "2830247f6b804a590c3c0753c7181044d8d1ef48", "title": "SAM: Database Generation from Query Workloads with Supervised Autoregressive Models"}, {"paperId": "60441de68623abfd43d8d85525f34a26308652bf", "title": "NeuroDB: A Neural Network Framework for Answering Range Aggregate Queries and Beyond"}, {"paperId": "11eb20c8206c3bde4e352895a66825aec82cc7c4", "title": "XLJoins"}, {"paperId": "671061237b92bd490f7857654d96baf0bf7ab807", "title": "PGMJoins: Random Join Sampling with Graphical Models"}, {"paperId": "89f84b2158beea25ba3224d51ece2a35e87256fe", "title": "Astrid: Accurate Selectivity Estimation for String Predicates using Deep Learning"}, {"paperId": "4a2b9f789bad0991e0d4780b325569dc1cd06a72", "title": "Relational data synthesis using generative adversarial networks"}, {"paperId": "c7b15ef0019af2df5f11bb5d906657f65727a4af", "title": "ML-AQP: Query-Driven Approximate Query Processing based on Machine Learning"}, {"paperId": "ff6da1881b3ec500aa753d3afc447626bc74d896", "title": "LAQP: Learning-based Approximate Query Processing"}, {"paperId": "fa887698e2cb62352319f8f866a28ff4565875a8", "title": "Video Monitoring Queries"}, {"paperId": "05006b4177fd77c2d03b814f58f3d264df497dc1", "title": "EntropyDB: a probabilistic approach to approximate query processing"}, {"paperId": "b9846d97332a1e948f1f557237dc0bf6b5b96439", "title": "DeepDB"}, {"paperId": "bf7f10fd72940b4cc77af6f0dfe1323d9b8b2475", "title": "DeepSPACE: Approximate Geospatial Query Processing with Deep Learning"}, {"paperId": "997b3e2fbcf52f9ae375bf1c5f71396f7477b0c3", "title": "NeuroDB: A Generic Neural Network Framework for Efficiently and Approximately Answering Range-Aggregate and Distance to Nearest Neighbor Queries"}, {"paperId": "06c567fe3ebccc4f75c228e557ff7543e5a8f111", "title": "Data Curation with Deep Learning"}, {"paperId": "5718f301636879f7b622bee0ce1e75824c750871", "title": "Advancing Analytical Database Systems"}, {"paperId": "e958ba9043c6f68d97e8711affc8a931b6aed9ba", "title": "Estimating Filtered Group-By Queries is Hard : Deep Learning to the Rescue"}, {"paperId": "5774f9638f3aded32ee894a8aad8451fc82b57f5", "title": "Building and Querying Probabilistic Models for Open World Database Systems"}]}
