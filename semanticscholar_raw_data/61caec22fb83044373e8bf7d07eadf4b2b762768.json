The reference implementation of the architecture is entirely based on opensource software and makes use of message queuing techniques in combination with Big Data related storage and extraction technologies. The approach specifically targets challenges related to different network zones and security levels in enterprise information architectures and across divergent production sites.", "venue": "International Conference on Enterprise Information Systems", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2018-05-04", "journal": {"pages": "175-182"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "40987903", "name": "Andreas Kirmse"}, {"authorId": "40992071", "name": "Vadim Kraus"}, {"authorId": "33577140", "name": "Max Hoffmann"}, {"authorId": "2661383", "name": "Tobias Meisen"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "aab87d5d6f23069249b22a8f3b51ccfb25b402f6", "title": "A Proposed Integration Architecture for University Research Data Repository to Support University and University Hospital on Medical Digital Image Management and Analytics using Hadoop"}, {"paperId": "5ec5fbe50abd671524b8be0b29a5db19e13872c0", "title": "PLAYING A FORTUNE-TELLER AND GETTING READY FOR THE BIG GAME: BEING READY FOR EMA TO BUILD A BRIDGE BETWEEN CODED AND SEMI-STRUCTURED DATA BY VIRTUE OF A DIGITAL FIT STRATEGY"}, {"paperId": "52645d4faff53b2a4e812f5289a9348e38898066", "title": "A framework for monitoring multiple databases in industries using OPC UA"}, {"paperId": "9b29de9bed727ab9b49921b4305be24286998cb4", "title": "StreamPipes Connect: Semantics-Based Edge Adapters for the IIoT"}, {"paperId": "c2aaaa0b2a22f3e88fa2a91e0078a46a8980e55b", "title": "How To RAMI 4.0: Towards An Agent-based Information Management Architecture"}, {"paperId": "2c95cb9e46a04401b4e5731798c16314ba23e656", "title": "Industrial Big Data: From Data to Information to Actions"}, {"paperId": "2abc4332ed1f03d8877bd7eaed7a9473c1deff5b", "title": "Manufacturing process data analysis pipelines: a requirements analysis and survey"}, {"paperId": "a5883c08a8ef868ebd8f7b23cdc97a811ef6f1e4", "title": "A framework for designing data pipelines for manufacturing systems"}, {"paperId": "fd59f181ba423590ea592cc776458b3b1420f8d7", "title": "A framework for designing data pipelines for manufacturing systems"}]}
