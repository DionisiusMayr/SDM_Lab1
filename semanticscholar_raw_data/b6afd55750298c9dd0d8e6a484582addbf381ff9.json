Modern analytical query processing engines have been highly optimized for multi-core multiCPU query execution, but lack the necessary abstractions to support concurrent hardware-conscious query execution over multiple heterogeneous devices and exploit the available accelerators. This work presents a Heterogeneity-conscious Analytical query Processing Engine (HAPE), a blueprint for hardware-conscious analytical engines for efficient and concurrent multi-CPU multi-GPU query execution. HAPE decomposes query execution on heterogeneous hardware into: 1) efficient single-device and 2) concurrent multi-device query execution. It uses hardware-conscious algorithms designed for single-device execution and combines them into efficient intra-device hardware-conscious execution modules, via code generation. HAPE combines these modules to achieve multi-device execution by handling data and control transfers. We validate our design by building a prototype and evaluate its performance using radix-join co-processing and the TPC-H benchmark. We show that it achieves up to 10x and 3.5x speed-up on the radix-join against CPU and GPU alternatives and 1.6x-8x against state-of-the-art CPUand GPU-based commercial DBMSs on the selected TPC-H queries.", "venue": "", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "3416158", "name": "Panagiotis Sioulas"}, {"authorId": "2263549757", "name": "Anastasia Ailamaki"}], "citations": []}
