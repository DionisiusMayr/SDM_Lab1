Industry, however, has standardized and is adopting Zoned Namespaces (ZNS) SSDs, which offer a new storage interface that dominates conventional SSDs. Continued research on conventional SSDs is thus a missed opportunity to unlock a step-change improvement in system performance by building on ZNS SSDs. We argue for an immediate and complete shift in research to ZNS SSDs and discuss research directions.", "venue": "USENIX Workshop on Hot Topics in Operating Systems", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2021-06-01", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the Workshop on Hot Topics in Operating Systems"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "4291453", "name": "Theano Stavrinos"}, {"authorId": "1998879", "name": "Daniel S.
