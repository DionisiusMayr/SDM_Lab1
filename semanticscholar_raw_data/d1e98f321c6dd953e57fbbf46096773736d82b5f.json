From computing to storage, everything in between and beyond is being developed for the cloud. With corporates, enterprises and governments moving towards cloud and leveraging its benefits, it also raises questions about the security of data being stored and processed in the cloud. Due to the nature and architecture of the cloud security is the most sensitive and often the only factor which dictates the weather an organization will move towards the cloud. In this study, the aim is to address the traditional vs cloud-based scenarios particularly for AWS since it is the pioneer of the cloud revolution. The proposed method is making better use of the cloud and its strengths for storing and securing data automatically.", "venue": "International Conference on Computing Communication and Networking Technologies", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-07-06", "journal": {"name": "2023 14th International Conference on Computing Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)", "pages": "1-6"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "9202078", "name": "Rajeshree Khande"}, {"authorId": "2166246284", "name": "Sheetal Rajapurkar"}, {"authorId": "2268073392", "name": "Pratik Barde"}, {"authorId": "2268073375", "name": "Harshi Balsara"}, {"authorId": "2268071815", "name": "Akash Datkhile"}], "citations": []}
