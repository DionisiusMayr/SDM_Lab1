At long last, it is affirmed by tests. The English teaching postability assessment framework in view of data mining has high practicability during the time spent down to earth application and completely meets the examination necessities.", "venue": "Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-09-13", "journal": {"name": "Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2217203583", "name": "Yanfei Yao"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "6fa0f0c4da7d281fdfdd1cb3d412b1c80d60f10a", "title": "Machine learning prediction model based on enhanced bat algorithm and support vector machine for slow employment prediction"}]}
