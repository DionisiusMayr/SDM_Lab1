Many studies worldwide explore technology in education, often relying on systematic reviews, though concerns about selection bias have emerged. This article takes a different approach, employing bibliometric analysis to delve into the trends, key authors, institutions, and themes of soft-computing technology applications in education (SCTAE) research in Africa. Initially, 7 435 papers were downloaded from Scopus and then narrowed down to 1 358 using the PRISMA model and defined criteria. Utilising the VOSViewer text mining tool, the article maps out prolific authors, institutions, and thematic networks. It provides detailed findings and outlines opportunities, challenges, and future research prospects in SCTAE in the African context.", "venue": "Africa Education Review", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-05-04", "journal": {"name": "Africa Education Review", "pages": "55 - 77", "volume": "19"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "66913822", "name": "Isaac Kofi Nti"}, {"authorId": "2273943061", "name": "Faiza Umar Bawah"}, {"authorId": "2103779104", "name": "Juanita Ahia Quarcoo"}, {"authorId": "2273945058", "name": "Favour Kalos"}], "citations": []}
