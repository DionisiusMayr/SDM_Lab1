But to derive real-time actionable insights from the data, it is important to bridge the gap between managing the data that is being updated at a high velocity (i.e., OLTP) and analyzing a large volume of data (i.e., OLAP). However, there has been a divide where specialized solutions were often deployed to support either OLTP or OLAP workloads but not both; thus, limiting the analysis to stale and possibly irrelevant data. In this paper, we present Lineage-based Data Store (L-Store) that combines the real-time processing of transactional and analytical workloads within a single unified engine by introducing a novel lineage-based storage architecture. We develop a contention-free and lazy staging of columnar data from a write-optimized form (suitable for OLTP) into a read-optimized form (suitable for OLAP) in a transactionally consistent approach that also supports querying and retaining the current and historic data. Our working prototype of L-Store demonstrates its superiority compared to state-of-the-art approaches under a comprehensive experimental evaluation.", "venue": "International Conference on Extending Database Technology", "year": 2016, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2016-01-15", "journal": {"pages": "540-551"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1719119", "name": "Mohammad Sadoghi"}, {"authorId": "2093889", "name": "Souvik Bhattacherjee"}, {"authorId": "49223443", "name": "Bishwaranjan Bhattacharjee"}, {"authorId": "1888104", "name": "Mustafa Canim"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "a9ba7e1ce9ae6266fc1befec0b0e4c79ca9323b6", "title": "Rethink Query Optimization in HTAP Databases"}, {"paperId": "253c44e6ceca121b443af207b600d9c2fd489a44", "title": "TiQuE: Improving the Transactional Performance of Analytical Systems for True Hybrid Workloads"}, {"paperId": "e6126678a7ee54786421d619dfd909c2eeafbbf5", "title": "Relational Fabric: Transparent Data Transformation"}, {"paperId": "a538f608e2dab90596e099b2e39a4bb8f5cb0600", "title": "Scalable and Robust Snapshot Isolation for High-Performance Storage Engines"}, {"paperId": "53337311a5c6f3952b7db22a429e67fe3a577d4c", "title": "Design and Implementation of an Efficient Electronic Bank Management Information System Based Data Warehouse and Data Mining Processing"}, {"paperId": "dbf3a261a1e0c515711bedd9e6ec07867f48c4da", "title": "LogStore: A Workload-Aware, Adaptable Key-Value Store on Hybrid Storage Systems"}, {"paperId": "b44c2438a0bb4c3db6f4fccd96e99f5110dbb1a7", "title": "Recursive SQL and GPU-support for in-database machine learning"}, {"paperId": "826af61b7397d84cae45dcc8f9ab85b778af91f3", "title": "Near-Data Processing in Database Systems on Native Computational Storage under HTAP Workloads"}, {"paperId": "4eac0fca0e861e56f502f348c3c0e024e0960c42", "title": "Polynesia: Enabling High-Performance and Energy-Efficient Hybrid Transactional/Analytical Databases with Hardware/Software Co-Design"}, {"paperId": "39f74f26853ccc34bfe5485e4d78219ed317d0e6", "title": "Enabling High-Performance and Energy-Efficient Hybrid Transactional/Analytical Databases with Hardware/Software Cooperation"}, {"paperId": "d43a3080b707f630178c5eec11da753d5e8b5ac5", "title": "Relational Memory: Native In-Memory Accesses on Rows and Columns"}, {"paperId": "c33ac1bb6f0b0542a3c43064e30a91245118bde8", "title": "Blockchain Transaction Processing"}, {"paperId": "d3ba27b361e3a6af22301c242d15f1542d330463", "title": "Data Warehouse Based on NoSQL: a literature mapping"}, {"paperId": "25017b33fc8259d7a3bfa40ff010a29dbbfeac1d", "title": "Growth of relational model: Interdependence and complementary to big data"}, {"paperId": "34b620fa8100fac34176c42147f63d54da038f89", "title": "WipDB: A Write-in-place Key-value Store that Mimics Bucket Sort"}, {"paperId": "477331a1f719497d7a89f4905ebad32714860761", "title": "Research and implementation of HTAP for distributed database"}, {"paperId": "fd861a78c9db26dc4668a4fdfc73dfff58dadc8f", "title": "Polynesia: Enabling Effective Hybrid Transactional/Analytical Databases with Specialized Hardware/Software Co-Design"}, {"paperId": "89e933377dd7fa7dc0aee62912891d0821df7d1b", "title": "TiDB"}, {"paperId": "911cc2bfa00c5076a3190f9ea72e978980101308", "title": "StreamingCube: Seamless Integration of Stream Processing and OLAP Analysis"}, {"paperId": "e7ccdd6706a1ec8ac8d21e5b7d152d3e60acfe7c", "title": "Mainlining Databases: Supporting Fast Transactional Workloads on Universal Columnar Data File Formats"}, {"paperId": "c81965b04afbcd7d483e415587a9a4e76e5d1214", "title": "Design and Implementation of SSD-Assisted Backup and Recovery for Database Systems"}, {"paperId": "42b7a0c9e6cbd1b237e84416feb6abb7e5d4ba10", "title": "GridTables: A One-Size-Fits-Most H2TAP Data Store"}, {"paperId": "a0f7af9aee75c9b846fda5ae06958df03422c08c", "title": "Efficient and non-blocking agreement protocols"}, {"paperId": "94a2aa325e55516e8d804d3844c73caad812e0ab", "title": "StreamingCube-Based Analytical Framework for Environmental Data Analysis"}, {"paperId": "909b831650ddfcd49dfa1243ba284c089547e5d3", "title": "QueCC: A Queue-oriented, Control-free Concurrency Architecture"}, {"paperId": "4c1ec89bc301fd8d6323113b7e38a43f528b4818", "title": "SOLA: Stream OLAP-based Analytical Framework for Roadway Maintenance"}, {"paperId": "e3ff5b9ec3284a974a1be635d192d4a68583704d", "title": "Are Databases Fit for Hybrid Workloads on GPUs?
