Every day, a large amount of big data is generated, and information is added based on the three characteristics of big data. Handling massive amounts of data with traditional methods has become a significant challenge. To test large amount of duplicate data is very challenging task for researchers. Big data performance testing has great promise for obtaining more optimised solutions. Better performance saves time and money while also producing more optimised results. This paper makes an attempt to present several performance testing approaches. Furthermore, we compare the performance testing techniques and analyse the performance improvement factors. Finally, various tools for performance testing of big data, such as Apache Jmeter, Apache Drill, LoadRunner, WebLoad, YCSB etc., are also compared with various parameters such as domain applicability, scripting interface etc., and tools are suggested to improve overall performance.", "venue": "2022 Seventh International Conference on Parallel, Distributed and Grid Computing (PDGC)", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-11-25", "journal": {"name": "2022 Seventh International Conference on Parallel, Distributed and Grid Computing (PDGC)", "pages": "292-297"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2210225098", "name": "Vijay Hasanpuri"}, {"authorId": "9443627", "name": "C.
