However, the effectiveness of existing models in understanding non-English inputs for multi-lingual code-related tasks is still far from well studied. This paper introduces CodeFuse-13B, an open-sourced pre-trained code LLM. It is specifically designed for code-related tasks with both English and Chinese prompts and supports over 40 programming languages. CodeFuse achieves its effectiveness by utilizing a high quality pre-training dataset that is carefully filtered by program analyzers and optimized during the training process. Extensive experiments are conducted using real-world usage scenarios, the industry-standard benchmark HumanEval-x, and the specially designed CodeFuseEval for Chinese prompts. To assess the effectiveness of CodeFuse, we actively collected valuable human feedback from the AntGroup's software development process where CodeFuse has been successfully deployed. The results demonstrate that CodeFuse-13B achieves a HumanEval pass@1 score of 37.10%, positioning it as one of the top multi-lingual code LLMs with similar parameter sizes. In practical scenarios, such as code generation, code translation, code comments, and testcase generation, CodeFuse performs better than other models when confronted with Chinese prompts.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-10-10", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2310.06266"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2258548532", "name": "Peng Di"}, {"authorId": "2257389174", "name": "Jianguo Li"}, {"authorId": "2257209424", "name": "Hang Yu"}, {"authorId": "2243775310", "name": "Wei Jiang"}, {"authorId": "2257000696", "name": "Wenting Cai"}, {"authorId": "2257354177", "name": "Yang Cao"}, {"authorId": "2257327194", "name": "Chaoyu Chen"}, {"authorId": "2257341355", "name": "Dajun Chen"}, {"authorId": "2144186457", "name": "Hongwei Chen"}, {"authorId": "2257257114", "name": "Liang Chen"}, {"authorId": "2258549483", "name": "Gang Fan"}, {"authorId": "2212511680", "name": "Jie Gong"}, {"authorId": "2256994664", "name": "Zi Gong"}, {"authorId": "47083169", "name": "Wen Hu"}, {"authorId": "2248231675", "name": "Tingting Guo"}, {"authorId": "2256998978", "name": "Zhichao Lei"}, {"authorId": "2257435713", "name": "Ting Li"}, {"authorId": "2257858404", "name": "Zheng Li"}, {"authorId": "2256998369", "name": "Ming Liang"}, {"authorId": "2167153231", "name": "Cong Liao"}, {"authorId": "2223594683", "name": "Bingchang Liu"}, {"authorId": "2237089618", "name": "Jiachen Liu"}, {"authorId": "2223887365", "name": "Zhiwei Liu"}, {"authorId": "2257017562", "name": "Shaojun Lu"}, {"authorId": "26714830", "name": "Mingquan Shen"}, {"authorId": "2257209359", "name": "Guangpei Wang"}, {"authorId": "2137538070", "name": "Huan Wang"}, {"authorId": "2211301579", "name": "Z.
