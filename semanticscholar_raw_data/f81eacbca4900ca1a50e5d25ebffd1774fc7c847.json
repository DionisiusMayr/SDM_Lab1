Our result fills the key remaining gap in the state-of-the-art MPC algorithms for vertex cover and matching problems; two classic optimization problems, which are duals of each other. Concretely, a recent line of work---by Czumaj et al. [STOC'18], Ghaffari et al. [PODC'18], Assadi et al. [SODA'19], and Gamlath et al. [PODC'19]---provides O(log log n) time algorithms for (1+\u03b5)-approximate maximum weight matching as well as for (2+\u03b5)-approximate minimum cardinality vertex cover. However, the latter algorithm does not work for the general weighted case of vertex cover, for which the best known algorithm remained at O(log n) time complexity.", "venue": "ACM Symposium on Parallelism in Algorithms and Architectures", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2020-05-21", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 32nd ACM Symposium on Parallelism in Algorithms and Architectures"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1772752", "name": "M.
