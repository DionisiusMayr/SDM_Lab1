The sensor nodes are powered by battery of finite energy which rapidly gets depleted during transmission of big size multimedia data like video, image and audio in the network. This process increases the rate of energy dissipation in the network and indirectly shortens the life span of the whole network. Since recharging of the battery of sensor nodes is not feasible, preserving the already available energy of the network is vital consideration in the design of various protocols. In this study, hybrid energy efficient FCM and cuckoo optimization based clustering algorithm is proposed. The fuzzy c-mean method is used in the cluster formation while cuckoo search algorithm is employed for CH election. The experimental results of MATLAB simulation of the proposed technique show that the technique is suitable for maintaining the energy of the network for longer time and it also outperforms the already existing algorithms in terms of network life time and minimum energy consumption.", "venue": "", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "81281551", "name": "Addisalem Genta"}, {"authorId": "2181753443", "name": "D.
