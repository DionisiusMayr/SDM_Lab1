There is a lot of value in this data, but power companies currently lack efficient power. The big data analysis platform cannot make effective use of these data. Due to its own particularity and strategy, the power system data cannot use the big data analysis platform provided by other companies. Therefore, it is particularly important to design and build an efficient and usable power system big data analysis platform. Based on the actual scenario, this paper constructs a highly customized power big data analysis platform and integrates user value model analysis services to solve the problems in the actual work of power companies.", "venue": "2021 6th Asia Conference on Power and Electrical Engineering (ACPEE)", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2021-04-01", "journal": {"name": "2021 6th Asia Conference on Power and Electrical Engineering (ACPEE)", "pages": "351-355"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2285939712", "name": "Luping Dai"}, {"authorId": "2286062972", "name": "Xiaobo Huang"}, {"authorId": "2064113113", "name": "Cao Xiu"}, {"authorId": "2286079057", "name": "Xiangkai Xia"}, {"authorId": "2105728821", "name": "Jin Anqi"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "4a466057378df91e8c0b33d1f4c579f7f076c7d1", "title": "Distributed Analytics in Smart Grids with Edge Computing and Computational Intelligence"}, {"paperId": "5d11b2e05847e97a0ee00a03080ea34802fb2a55", "title": "A General-Purpose Distributed Analytic Platform Based on Edge Computing and Computational Intelligence Applied on Smart Grids"}]}
