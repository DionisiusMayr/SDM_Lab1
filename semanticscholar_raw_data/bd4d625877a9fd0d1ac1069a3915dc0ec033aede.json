It is kept in repositories for data processing via cluster nodes that are distributed throughout the wider network. Because of its magnitude and real-time creation, big data processing faces challenges with latency and throughput. Modern systems such as Hadoop and SPARK manage large amounts of data with their HDFS, Map Reduce, and In-Memory analytics approaches, but the migration cost is higher than usual. With Genetic Algorithm-based Optimization (GABO), Map Reduce Scheduling (MRS) and Data Replication have provided answers to this challenge. With multi objective solutions provided by Genetic Algorithm, resource utilization and node availability improve processing performance in large data environments. This work develops a novel creative strategy for enhancing data processing performance in big data analytics called Map Reduce Scheduling Based Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (MRSNSGA). The Hadoop-Map Reduce paradigm handles the placement of data in distributed blocks as a chunk and their scheduling among the cluster nodes in a wider network. Best fit solutions with high latency and low accessing time are extracted from the findings of various objective solutions. Experiments were carried out as a simulation with several inputs of varied location node data and cluster racks. Finally, the results show that the speed of data processing in big data analytics was enhanced by 30\u201335% over previous methodologies. Optimization approaches developed to locate the best solutions from multi-objective solutions at a rate of 24\u201330% among cluster nodes.", "venue": "Journal of Intelligent &amp; Fuzzy Systems", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-03-11", "journal": {"name": "Journal of Intelligent &amp; Fuzzy Systems"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2291217708", "name": "M.R.
