Unfortunately, current platforms and tools often require data scientists to glue together and maintain custom-built platforms consisting of multiple Big Data component technologies. In this paper, we explain how Apache AsterixDB, an open source Big Data Management System, can help to reduce the burden involved in using machine learning algorithms in Big Data analytics. In particular, we describe how AsterixDB's built-in support for user-defined functions (UDFs), the availability of UDFs in data ingestion pipelines and queries, and the provision of machine learning platform and notebook inter-operation capabilities can together enable data analysts to more easily create and manage end-to-end analytical dataflows.", "venue": "DEEM@SIGMOD", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book"], "publicationDate": "2018-06-15", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the Second Workshop on Data Management for End-To-End Machine Learning"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2555857", "name": "Wail Y.
