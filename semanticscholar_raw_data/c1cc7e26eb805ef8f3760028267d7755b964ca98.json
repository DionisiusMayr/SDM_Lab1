These different objects generate huge data which consequently lead to the need of requirements of efficient storage and processing. Cloud computing is an emerging technology to overcome this problem. However, there are some applications (healthcare) which need to process data in real time to improve its performance and require low latency and delay. Fog computing is one of the promising solutions which facilitate healthcare domain in terms of reducing the delay multihop data communication, distributing resource demands, and promoting service flexibility. In this study, a fog-based IoT healthcare framework is proposed in order to minimize the energy consumption of the fog nodes. Experimental results reveal that the performance of the proposed framework is efficient in terms of network delay and energy usage. Furthermore, the authors discussed and suggested important services of big data infrastructure which need to be present in fog devices for the analytics of healthcare big data.", "venue": "Scientific Programming", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-06-12", "journal": {"name": "Sci.
