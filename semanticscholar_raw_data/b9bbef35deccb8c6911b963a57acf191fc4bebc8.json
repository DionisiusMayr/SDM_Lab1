The data collected in the data warehouse will generate new data collection through the operations of data union, splitting, and transformation. This data conversion relationship in the data production process is called data lineage. Therefore, tracking the data lineage in the data warehouse is an important part of the process of data warehouse construction. However, the existing open-source solutions have shortcomings such as high coupling, poor accuracy, and intrusion in the processing of this critical link. Therefore, this paper designs a column-level data lineage processing system based on the Hive data warehouse for the Hive data warehouse. The system has realized the ability to analyze the Data lineage of Hive SQL data locally and realizes the fine-grained and high accuracy of the data lineage analysis results while ensuring the low coupling between the data lineage function and the Hive data warehouse.", "venue": "ICBDT", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book"], "publicationDate": "2020-09-18", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Big Data Technologies"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2197583758", "name": "Zehua Tan"}, {"authorId": "49042238", "name": "H.
