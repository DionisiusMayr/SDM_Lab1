This enables analytics applications to utilize VSFS high-performance file-search service without changing their data model. VSFS versatile file-indexing mechanism is designed to offer great flexibility for applications to control indices to satisfy analytics needs. The evaluations driven by two real-world analytics applications demonstrate VSFS' high scalability and powerful data-filtering functionality.", "venue": "2014 9th Parallel Data Storage Workshop", "year": 2014, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2014-11-16", "journal": {"name": "2014 9th Parallel Data Storage Workshop", "pages": "25-30"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2112280561", "name": "Lei Xu"}, {"authorId": "2129485655", "name": "Ziling Huang"}, {"authorId": "144248618", "name": "Hong Jiang"}, {"authorId": "50822200", "name": "Lei Tian"}, {"authorId": "31923084", "name": "D.
