It allows accurate surveying on the density of coastal dune vegetation and potentially individual species. We thus analyze big data to develop tools for coastal resiliency and sustainability.", "venue": "2021 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2021-12-15", "journal": {"name": "2021 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "pages": "5903-5905"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2149944362", "name": "Britnie Gonzalez-Moodie"}, {"authorId": "2149944997", "name": "Shane Daiek"}, {"authorId": "1388601147", "name": "J.
