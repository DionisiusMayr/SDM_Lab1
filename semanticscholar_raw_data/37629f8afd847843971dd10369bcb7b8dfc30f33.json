This chapter describes an optimized Big GIS framework in Map Reduce Environment M2BG. The suggested framework has been integrated into Map Reduce Environment in order to solve the storage issues and get the benefit of the Hadoop environment. M2BG include two steps: Big GIS warehouse and Big GIS Map Reduce. The first step contains three main layers: Data Source and Storage Layer (DSSL), Data Processing Layer (DPL), and Data Analysis Layer (DAL). The second layer is responsible for clustering using swarms as inputs for the Hadoop phase. Then it is scheduled in the mapping part with the use of a preempted priority scheduling algorithm; some data types are classified as critical and some others are ordinary data type; the reduce part used, merge sort algorithm M2BG, should solve security and be implemented with real data in the simulated environment and later in the real world.", "venue": "Handbook of Research on Digital Research Methods and Architectural Tools in Urban Planning and Design", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "Handbook of Research on Digital Research Methods and Architectural Tools in Urban Planning and Design"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "52054031", "name": "Nada M.
