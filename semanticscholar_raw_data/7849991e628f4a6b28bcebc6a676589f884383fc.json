Yet, the unprecedented size of an NLP model stresses both latency and memory, creating a tension between the two key resources of a mobile device. To meet a target latency, holding the whole model in memory launches execution as soon as possible but increases one app\u2019s memory footprints by several times, limiting its bene\ufb01ts to only a few inference before being recycled by mobile memory management. On the other hand, loading the model from storage on demand incurs a few seconds long IO, far exceeding the delay range satisfying to a user; pipelining layerwise model loading and execution does not hide IO either, due to the large skewness between IO and computation delays. To this end, we propose Speedy Transformer Inference (STI). Built on the key idea of maximizing IO/compute resource utilization on the most important parts of a model, STI reconciles the latency/memory tension via two novel techniques. First, model sharding. STI manages model parameters as independently tunable shards, and pro\ufb01les their importance to accuracy. Second, elastic pipeline planning with a preload buffer. STI instantiates an IO/compute pipeline and uses a small buffer for preload shards to bootstrap execution without stalling in early stages; it judiciously selects, tunes, and assembles shards per their importance for resource-elastic execution, which maximizes inference accuracy. Atop two commodity SoCs, we build STI and evaluate it against a wide range of NLP tasks, under a practical range of target latencies, and on both CPU and GPU. We demonstrate that, STI delivers high accuracies with 1\u20132 orders of magnitude lower memory, outperforming competitive baselines.", "venue": "", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2110519994", "name": "Liwei Guo"}, {"authorId": "1931741049", "name": "Wonkyo Choe"}, {"authorId": "1774176", "name": "F.
