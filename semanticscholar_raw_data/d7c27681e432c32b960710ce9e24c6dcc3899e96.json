We describe the challenge in the hearth of the competition task, as well as the data acquisition and preparation steps. We also provide a brief overview of the top-performing solutions submitted by participants. Finally, we present results of the post-competition data analysis, in which we consider the similarity of solutions submitted by various teams in terms of their errors on the test data. We conclude this analysis by discussion of the significance and impact of the competition results on the underlying problem of constructing effective and efficient anonymization algorithms for monitoring in the DOOH advertising industry.", "venue": "2022 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-12-17", "journal": {"name": "2022 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "pages": "6471-6480"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1678848", "name": "Marcin S.
