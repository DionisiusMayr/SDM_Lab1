The main goal is to preserve the stability of the vehicle even with the existence of structural and actuator faults. The considered system is a four-rotor drone described by means of nonlinear equations. The suggested FTC relies on the state-dependent-Riccati equation (SDRE). Different simulations are showcased demonstrating the effectiveness of the suggested approach.", "venue": "2023 IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence & Green Energy (ICAIGE)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-10-12", "journal": {"name": "2023 IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence & Green Energy (ICAIGE)", "pages": "1-5"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "18134613", "name": "Hajer Mlayeh"}, {"authorId": "2023739", "name": "Atef Khedher"}], "citations": []}
