Instrumenting these systems to report quantitative telemetry data called metrics enables engineers to monitor and maintain services that operate at an enormous scale so they can respond rapidly to any issues that might arise. To be useful, metrics must be ingested, stored, and queryable in real time, but many existing solutions cannot keep up with the sheer volume of generated data. This paper describes Mach, a pluggable storage engine we are building specifically to handle high-volume metrics data. Similar to many popular libraries (e.g., Berkeley DB, LevelDB, RocksDB, WiredTiger), Mach provides a simple API to store and retrieve data. Mach\u2019s lean, loosely coordinated architecture aggressively leverages the characteristics of metrics data and observability work-loads, yielding an order-of-magnitude improvement over existing approaches\u2014especially those marketed as \u201ctime series database systems\u201d (TSDBs). In fact, our preliminary results show that Mach can achieve nearly 10 \u00d7 higher write throughput and 3 \u00d7 higher read throughput compared to several widely used alternatives.", "venue": "Conference on Innovative Data Systems Research", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "8347899", "name": "Franco Solleza"}, {"authorId": "2825799", "name": "Andrew Crotty"}, {"authorId": "2678944", "name": "Suman Karumuri"}, {"authorId": "1738467643", "name": "Nesime Tatbul"}, {"authorId": "2031287", "name": "S.
