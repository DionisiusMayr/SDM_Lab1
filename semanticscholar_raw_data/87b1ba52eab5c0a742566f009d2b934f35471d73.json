Spatiotemporal clustering of data is an important analytical technique with many applications in air quality, including source identification, monitoring network analysis and airshed partitioning. Hierarchical agglomerative clustering is one such algorithm, where sets of input data are grouped by a chosen similarity metric, without requiring any a priori information about the final arrangement of clusters. Modern implementations of the algorithm have \ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc5b 2 log (\ud835\udc5b)) 10 computational complexity and \ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc5b 2 ) memory usage, where n is the number of initial clusters. This dependence can strain the resources of even very large individual computers as the number of initial clusters increases into the tens or hundreds of thousands, for example, to cluster all the points in an air-quality model\u2019s simulation grid as part of airshed analysis (~10 5 to 10 6 time series to be clustered). Using two parallelization techniques \u2013 the Message Passing Interface (MPI) and Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP) \u2013 we have reduced the amount of wallclock time while increasing the memory available to a new 15 hierarchical clustering program, by dividing up the program into blocks which are run on separate CPUs but communicate with each other to produce a single result. The new algorithm opens up new directions for large data analysis which had previously not been possible. Here we present a massively parallelized version of an agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm which is able to cluster an entire year of hourly regional air-quality model output (538x540 domain; 290,520 hourly concentration timeseries) in 12 hours 37 minutes of wallclock time, by spreading the computation across 8000 Intel\u00ae 20 Xeon\u00ae Platinum 8830 CPU cores with a total of 2TB of RAM. We then show how the new algorithm allows a new form of air-quality analysis to be carried out starting from air-quality model output.
