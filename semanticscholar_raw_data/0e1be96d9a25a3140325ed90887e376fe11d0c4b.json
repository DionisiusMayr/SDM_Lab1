Identifying ongoing tasks on weak nodes is how it\u2019s described. The total computation time isthe sum of the execution times of the two stages in the Map process (copy, combine) and the three stages in the Reducephase (shuffle, sort, and reduce). The main aim of this paper is to estimate the accurate execution time in each location. Theproposed approach uses a backpropagation neural network on Hadoop to detect straggler tasks and calculate the remainingtask execution time, which is crucial in straggler task identification. The comparative analysis is done with some efficientmodels in this domain, such as LATE, ESAMR, and the real remaining time for WordCount and Sort benchmarks. It wasfound that the proposed model is capable of detecting straggler tasks in accurately estimating execution time. It also helpsin reducing the execution time that it takes to complete a task.", "venue": "Converter", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2021-01-31", "journal": {"name": "CONVERTER"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2124748726", "name": "Ajay Bansal, Manmohan Sharma, Ashu Gupta"}], "citations": []}
