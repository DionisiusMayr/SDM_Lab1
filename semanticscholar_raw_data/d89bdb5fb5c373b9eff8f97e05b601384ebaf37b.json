Developers today need to combine a variety of libraries and services to build a distributed edge application. As a result, the application becomes tightly coupled with the implementation choice made, such as the protocol chosen to exchange data or the storage server chosen to store data. This makes applications less reusable. We propose a domain-specific language called EdgeShell that can be used to compose edge applications in a manner similar to writing UNIX pipelines.", "venue": "IFIP International Information Security Conference", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-12-01", "journal": {"name": "2022 IEEE/ACM 7th Symposium on Edge Computing (SEC)", "pages": "302-304"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1410766785", "name": "Kumseok Jung"}, {"authorId": "1397306592", "name": "Julien Gascon-Samson"}, {"authorId": "1715185", "name": "K.
