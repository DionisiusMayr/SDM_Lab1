A major part of the retrieving time is on data addressing, that is, finding the location of the value in memory that corresponds to a key. This paper introduces an address-centric approach to speed up the addressing by creating a shortcut for the translation of a key to the physical address of the value. The new technique is materialized with a novel in-memory table, STLT, a virtual-physical address buffer, and two new instructions. It creates a fast path for data addressing and meanwhile opens up opportunities for the use of simpler and faster hash tables to strike a better tradeoff between hashing conflicts and hashing overhead. Together, the new technique brings up to 1.4\u00d7 speedups on key-value store application Redis and up to 13\u00d7 speedups on some widely used indexing data structures, consistently outperforming prior solutions significantly.", "venue": "International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-02-01", "journal": {"name": "2021 IEEE International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA)", "pages": "736-748"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1715145", "name": "Chencheng Ye"}, {"authorId": "7870162", "name": "Yuanchao Xu"}, {"authorId": "37914192", "name": "Xipeng Shen"}, {"authorId": "144925807", "name": "Xiaofei Liao"}, {"authorId": "145914256", "name": "Hai Jin"}, {"authorId": "1717365", "name": "Yan Solihin"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "9eff8516ded06d69b63fedfd10d9a4f50f219eb3", "title": "Memory-Efficient Hashed Page Tables"}, {"paperId": "a36051d0999968778d7933820e7c451b2754d982", "title": "Reconciling Selective Logging and Hardware Persistent Memory Transaction"}, {"paperId": "68bfd53fae324adfb027e0bdec03b38b9daba115", "title": "Rambda: RDMA-driven Acceleration Framework for Memory-intensive \u00b5s-scale Datacenter Applications"}, {"paperId": "32b84001880df214d956ad619e3ccea327f10a95", "title": "SpecPMT: Speculative Logging for Resolving Crash Consistency Overhead of Persistent Memory"}, {"paperId": "6592083164db8f5d62d082eaa9eb41c82b9e4c37", "title": "Revisiting Log-Structured Merging for KV Stores in Hybrid Memory Systems"}, {"paperId": "07887e53e5a5128d5cf5817ab5f08453c2c15051", "title": "ORCA: A Network and Architecture Co-design for Offloading us-scale Datacenter Applications"}, {"paperId": "a403828184258027268abc944cfc38f6e27d4dc2", "title": "Preserving Addressability Upon GC-Triggered Data Movements on Non-Volatile Memory"}]}
