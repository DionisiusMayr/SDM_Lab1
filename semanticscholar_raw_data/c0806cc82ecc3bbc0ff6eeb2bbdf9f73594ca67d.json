One of the key challenges in graph pattern matching is to process increasingly large graphs that often do not fit in the memory of a single machine. In this paper, we present PGX.D/Async, a scalable distributed pattern matching engine for property graphs that is able to handle very large datasets. PGX.D/Async implements pattern matching operations with asynchronous depth-first traversal, allowing for a high degree of parallelism and precise control over memory consumption. In PGX.D/Async, developers can query graphs with PGQL, an SQL-like query language for property graphs. Essentially, PGX.D/Async provides an intuitive, distributed, in-memory pattern matching engine for very large graphs.", "venue": "GRADES@SIGMOD/PODS", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2017-05-19", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the Fifth International Workshop on Graph Data-management Experiences & Systems"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "153882027", "name": "Nicholas P.
