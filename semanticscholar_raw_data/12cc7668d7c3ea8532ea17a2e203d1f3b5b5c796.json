The partial least squares method allows extracting dietary patterns related to a specific health outcome. Few studies have evaluated obesity-related dietary patterns associated with telomeres length. This study aims to identify dietary patterns explaining obesity markers and to assess their association with leukocyte telomere length (LTL), a biological marker of the ageing process. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: University campuses in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Participants: 478 participants of a civil servants\u2019 cohort study with data on food consumption, obesity measurements (total body fat, visceral fat, BMI, leptin and adiponectin) and blood samples. Results: Three dietary patterns were extracted: (1) fast food and meat; (2) healthy and (3) traditional pattern, which included rice and beans, the staple foods most consumed in Brazil. All three dietary patterns explained 23\u00b72 % of food consumption variation and 10\u00b77 % of the obesity-related variables. The fast food and meat pattern were the first factor extracted, explaining 11\u201313 % variation of the obesity-related response variables (BMI, total body fat and visceral fat), leptin and adiponectin showed the lowest percentage (4\u00b75\u20130\u00b71 %). The healthy pattern mostly explained leptin and adiponectin variations (10\u00b77 and 3\u00b73 %, respectively). The traditional pattern was associated with LTL (\u03b2 = 0\u00b70117; 95 % CI 0\u00b70001, 0\u00b70233) after adjustment for the other patterns, age, sex, exercise practice, income and energy intake. Conclusion: Leukocyte telomere length was longer among participants eating a traditional dietary pattern that combines fruit, vegetables and beans.", "venue": "Public Health Nutrition", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-05-26", "journal": {"name": "Public Health Nutrition", "pages": "2076 - 2082", "volume": "26"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "90129154", "name": "N.
