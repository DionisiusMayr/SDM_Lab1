Vibrations impact the machining operation's background noise, tool life, and the standard of the manufactured art. Thus, these bothersome vibrations have to be subdued while machining. The review abridges the effects of vibration (poor surface finish, increased tool wear and reduced machining accuracy etc.), with a focus on active, passive and semi active vibration which are the techniques to control vibration characteristics and the recent developments on technology involving vibration. Series of operations are reviewed with different approaches to control vibration in their machine tools. This paper offers a thorough grasp of machine tool vibration phenomena, their impact on machining efficiency, and methods for assessment and mitigation. Challenges have been assessed with preferable solutions provided by researchers for future related studies.", "venue": "2023 2nd International Conference on Multidisciplinary Engineering and Applied Science (ICMEAS)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-11-01", "journal": {"name": "2023 2nd International Conference on Multidisciplinary Engineering and Applied Science (ICMEAS)", "pages": "1-6"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "145341677", "name": "T.
