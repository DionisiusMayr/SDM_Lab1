Lack of knowledge regarding which cloud configuration is best to execute a pipeline often results in an unnecessary increase in cost due to selecting a more expensive cloud tier than needed. Resources in the cloud are expensive, so determining the best configuration before actually running the pipeline saves money and time. To this end, we introduce Hummingbird, a framework that predicts the best configuration to execute genomics pipelines on Google cloud.", "venue": "", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "40455585", "name": "V.
