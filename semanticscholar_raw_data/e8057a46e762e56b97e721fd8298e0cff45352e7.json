In this problem, the goal is to partition the input into $k$ sets by choosing $k$ centers such that the maximum distance from any data point to its closest center is minimized. It is known that it is NP-hard to get a better than $2$ approximation for this problem. While in many applications the input may naturally be modeled as a graph, all prior works on $k$-center problem in dynamic settings are on point sets in arbitrary metric spaces. In this paper, we give a deterministic decremental $(2+\\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm and a randomized incremental $(4+\\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm, both with amortized update time $kn^{o(1)}$ for weighted graphs. Moreover, we show a reduction that leads to a fully dynamic $(2+\\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for the $k$-center problem, with worst-case update time that is within a factor $k$ of the state-of-the-art fully dynamic $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximation single-source shortest paths algorithm in graphs. Matching this bound is a natural goalpost because the approximate distances of each vertex to its center can be used to maintain a $(2+\\epsilon)$-approximation of the graph diameter and the fastest known algorithms for such a diameter approximation also rely on maintaining approximate single-source distances.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-07-28", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2307.15557"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "41018464", "name": "Emilio Cruciani"}, {"authorId": "51487176", "name": "S.
