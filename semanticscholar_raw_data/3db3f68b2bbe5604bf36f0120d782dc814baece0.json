Logs are the key to helping customers understand the status of their applications running on the cloud. They are vital for various scenarios, such as service stability assessment, root cause analysis and user activity profiling. Therefore, it is essential to manage the massive amount of logs collected on the cloud and tap their value. Although various log storages have been widely used in the past few decades, it is still a non-trivial problem to design a cost-effective log storage for cloud applications. It faces challenges of heavy write throughput of tens of millions of log records per second, retrieval on PB-level logs and massive hundreds of thousands of tenants. Traditional log processing systems cannot satisfy all these requirements. To address these challenges, we propose the cloud-native log database LogStore. It combines shared-nothing and shared-data architecture, and utilizes highly scalable and low-cost cloud object storage, while overcoming the bandwidth limitations and high latency of using remote storage when writing a large number of logs. We also propose a multi-tenant management method that physically isolates tenant data to ensure compliance and flexible data expiration policies, and uses a novel traffic scheduling algorithm to mitigate the impact of traffic skew and hotspots among tenants. In addition, we design an efficient column index structure LogBlock to support queries with full-text search, and combined several query optimization techniques to reduce query latency on cloud object storage. LogStore has been deployed in Alibaba Cloud on a large scale (more than 500 machines), processing logs of more than 100 GB per second, and has been running stably for more than two years.", "venue": "SIGMOD Conference", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2021-06-09", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 2021 International Conference on Management of Data"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "152283180", "name": "Wei Cao"}, {"authorId": "50482118", "name": "Xiaojie Feng"}, {"authorId": "2111677743", "name": "Boyuan Liang"}, {"authorId": "2146332031", "name": "Tianyu Zhang"}, {"authorId": "1726030041", "name": "Yusong Gao"}, {"authorId": "2108289070", "name": "Yunyang Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2146324505", "name": "Feifei Li"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "f0c335cc7d8ecc7b6b0ee1a5516e32df658b1f35", "title": "Exploiting Data-pattern-aware Vertical Partitioning to Achieve Fast and Low-cost Cloud Log Storage"}, {"paperId": "3b22b31afe9e19f0360c6db9b9bce995bdc1d4fd", "title": "A Comprehensive Scalable Framework for Cloud-Native Pattern Detection with Enhanced Expressiveness"}, {"paperId": "56b04b587b38ec39bcd6f8a175d7b87f25512ce9", "title": "Real-time Workload Pattern Analysis for Large-scale Cloud Databases"}, {"paperId": "8430997d1f1a3c6f99e517004f88d4d1ac4869c5", "title": "LogGrep: Fast and Cheap Cloud Log Storage by Exploiting both Static and Runtime Patterns"}, {"paperId": "ecceaf2cb9419e90b164b3d634824b699927ca91", "title": "Persistent Memory Disaggregation for Cloud-Native Relational Databases"}, {"paperId": "80009aff443ba823c4586e2608f9f87424df3e0e", "title": "ESDB: Processing Extremely Skewed Workloads in Real-time"}, {"paperId": "f7652d7225543d891d3d5a6318925a5a481618ca", "title": "PinSQL: Pinpoint Root Cause SQLs to Resolve Performance Issues in Cloud Databases"}]}
