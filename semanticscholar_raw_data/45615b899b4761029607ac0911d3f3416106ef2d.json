In this chapter, the authors explore how to transparently boost the I/O bandwidth during peak utilization to deliver high performance without over-provisioning storage resources. The proposal relies on the idea of leveraging short-lived virtual disks of better performance characteristics (and more expensive) to act during peaks as a caching layer for the persistent virtual disks where the application data is stored during runtime. They show how this idea can be achieved efficiently at the block-device level, using a caching mechanism that leverages iterative behavior and learns from past experience. Second, they introduce a corresponding performance and cost prediction methodology. They demonstrate the benefits of our proposal both for micro-benchmarks and for two real-life applications using large-scale experiments. They conclude with a discussion on how these techniques can be generalized for increasingly complex landscape of modern cloud storage.", "venue": "Applying Integration Techniques and Methods in Distributed Systems and Technologies", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "Applying Integration Techniques and Methods in Distributed Systems and Technologies"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "145925450", "name": "Bogdan Nicolae"}, {"authorId": "2934158", "name": "Pierre Riteau"}, {"authorId": "8449917", "name": "Zhuo Zhen"}, {"authorId": "50110206", "name": "K.
