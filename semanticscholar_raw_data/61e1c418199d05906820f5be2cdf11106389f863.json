Due to continuous drastic increase of amount of data, all natural language processing systems require special approach oriented to it. Implementing and evaluating such mechanism was a strong incentive to conduct this research. In this paper, sentiment analysis was implemented on Kazakh language via Spark on the basis of data set taken from Kazakh books. The data was initially unbalanced. There was achieved training F1 measure over 90 %.", "venue": "International Conference on Electronics, Computer and Computation", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2019-12-01", "journal": {"name": "2019 15th International Conference on Electronics, Computer and Computation (ICECCO)", "pages": "1-4"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "68976164", "name": "Azamat Serek"}, {"authorId": "68976616", "name": "A.
