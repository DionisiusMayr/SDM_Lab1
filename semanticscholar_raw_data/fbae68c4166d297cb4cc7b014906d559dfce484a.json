Therefore, there is an urgent need for highly scalable and powerful computational systems. Among the state-of\u2013the-art parallel computing platforms, Apache Spark is a fast, general-purpose, in-memory, iterative computing framework for large-scale data processing that ensures high fault tolerance and high scalability by introducing the resilient distributed dataset abstraction. In terms of performance, Spark can be up to 100 times faster in terms of memory access and 10 times faster in terms of disk access than Hadoop. Moreover, it provides advanced application programming interfaces in Java, Scala, Python, and R. It also supports some advanced components, including Spark SQL for structured data processing, MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for computing graphs, and Spark Streaming for stream computing. We surveyed Spark-based applications used in next-generation sequencing and other biological domains, such as epigenetics, phylogeny, and drug discovery. The results of this survey are used to provide a comprehensive guideline allowing bioinformatics researchers to apply Spark in their own fields.", "venue": "GigaScience", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2018-08-01", "journal": {"name": "GigaScience", "volume": "7"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2114010769", "name": "Runxin Guo"}, {"authorId": "2143935919", "name": "Yi Zhao"}, {"authorId": "144268946", "name": "Q.
