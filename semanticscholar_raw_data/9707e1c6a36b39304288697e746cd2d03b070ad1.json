It is shown that DTT is an adjustable dynamic balance of information flows between digital and physical objects of the area, which is a permanent generator of new knowledge about the area in real time. The difference between the concepts is indicated: a digital terrain model, a digital terrain shadow, a digital twin of the terrain in the geocognitive analysis of the terrain as the main aspect of any study area. It was revealed that with the help of DTT it is possible to model the changes occurring in the territorial system as a whole, as well as as a result of changes in its individual fragments due to the emergence effect. The possibility of using methods of geocognitive terrain modeling to assess the effectiveness of territory management and eliminate the risks of its development is determined. The necessity of combining simulation models and geocognitive methods with the use of artificial intelligence is indicated.", "venue": "Interexpo GEO-Siberia", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-05-18", "journal": {"name": "Interexpo GEO-Siberia"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "73272045", "name": "D.
