It has given tremendous support and become the building blocks in the development of important cyber-physical systems and it is being severed in a variety of application domains, including healthcare. A methodological evolution of the Internet of Things, enabled it to extend to the physical world beyond the electronic world by connecting miscellaneous devices through the internet, thus making everything is connected. In recent years it has gained higher attention for its potential to alleviate the strain on the healthcare sector caused by the rising and aging population along with the increase in chronic diseases and global pandemics. This paper surveys about various usages of IoT healthcare technologies and reviews the state of the art services and applications, recent trends in IoT based healthcare solutions, and various challenges posed including security and privacy issues, which researchers, service providers and end users need to pay higher attention. Further, this paper discusses how innovative IoT enabled technologies like cloud computing, fog computing, blockchain, and big data can be used to leverage modern healthcare facilities and mitigate the burden on healthcare resources.", "venue": "International Journal of Engineering and Management Research", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2020-08-31", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Engineering and Management Research"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "81391508", "name": "N.
