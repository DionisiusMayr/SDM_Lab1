As these applications need to run \"forever\", cope with large and spiky data loads, they further require to be run in a distributed setting. Unsurprisingly, we are unaware of any distributed streaming system that provides all those properties. Instead, existing systems take large simplifications, such as implementing sliding windows as a fixed set of partially overlapping windows, jeopardizing metric accuracy (violating financial regulator rules) or latency (breaching service agreements). \nIn this paper, we propose Railgun, a fault-tolerant, elastic, and distributed streaming system supporting real-time sliding windows for scenarios requiring high loads and millisecond-level latencies. We benchmarked an initial prototype of Railgun using real data, showing significant lower latency than Flink, and low memory usage, independent of window size.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-09-01", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2009.00361"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3210157", "name": "Jo\u00e3o Oliveirinha"}, {"authorId": "145481610", "name": "Ana Sofia Gomes"}, {"authorId": "2059047943", "name": "Pedro Cardoso"}, {"authorId": "2642808", "name": "P.
