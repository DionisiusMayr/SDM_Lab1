This work has been tied up with an IT company in India with a large data set of telecom customers. As part of data analytics, the first task was to perform cleansing of bad and missing data, transforming heterogeneous formats into a unified format, semantic analysis on the data (semantics of attributes and their relationships), and then perform unsupervised learning using BIRCH technique of clustering. We describe and discuss the approach and results of these tasks on a sample data in this work.", "venue": "International Conference on Computer and Information Technology", "year": 2016, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2016-12-01", "journal": {"name": "2016 IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (CIT)", "pages": "104-107"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2115344553", "name": "Nayan Gupta"}, {"authorId": "8477183", "name": "Mohammed Wasid"}, {"authorId": "144878104", "name": "R.
