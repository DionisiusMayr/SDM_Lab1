Data are an increasingly worthy asset, and they reduce information asymmetries, softening conflicts of interest, and mitigating risk (as far as they reduce the difference between continuously updated expected outcomes and reality). The impact on product and process innovation, know-how, patentable inventions, and digital marketing intangibles (trademarks, mobile apps, web domains, etc.) represents a sharp discontinuity in business models, allowing for scalable extra-returns. The economic potential is still mostly unexplored, in terms of improving business planning accuracy.", "venue": "The Valuation of Digital Intangibles", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2019-02-07", "journal": {"name": "CompSciRN: Databases (Topic)"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "8154761", "name": "Roberto Moro Visconti"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "ef6ee28fe0552342d0c2b1f282ecd4b3f6eacd67", "title": "INTERNET OF THINGS AND PRIVACY"}, {"paperId": "508b40d99d5cdf1b81904200183734220152a845", "title": "An Adaptable Big Data Value Chain Framework for End-to-End Big Data Monetization"}]}
