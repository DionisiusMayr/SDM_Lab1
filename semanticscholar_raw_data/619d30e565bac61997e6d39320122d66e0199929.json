We reviewed and analyzed the main methodologies used to solve tasks of these types. The lists of definitions are presented to introduce the main structural elements and functional dependences for data structures \"m-tuples based on ordered sets of arbitrary cardinality.\" We described some properties of these data structures that allow predetermining the result of an operation on its elements without executing a computational algorithm. We also calculated the components of pairwise combinations of Boolean elements. These operands satisfy the data structure properties. The graphs demonstrate the dynamics of changes in these components. These depend on the cardinality of the basis set for different groups of the data structure properties. The logic-based conclusions about the influence of the properties we investigated and methods to work with \"m-tuples\" allow us to minimize computational resources when processing \"big data.\"", "venue": "", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "72824837", "name": "O.
