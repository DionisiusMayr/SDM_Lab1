An important aspect that has not been examined in these systems yet, is the energy consumption during the applications\u2019 execution. Reducing the energy consumption of modern datacenters is a necessity, as datacenters contribute over 2 percent of the total US electric usage. However, efficiently scheduling applications in distributed processing systems can be challenging as there is a trade-off between minimizing the datacenter's energy usage and satisfying the application performance requirements. In this work we propose, ExpREsS, a scheduler for orchestrating the execution of Spark applications in a way that enables us to minimize the energy consumption while ensuring that the applications\u2019 performance requirements are met. Our approach exploits time-series segmentation for capturing the applications\u2019 energy usage and execution times, and then applies a novel DVFS technique to minimize the energy consumption. In order to tackle the limited number of application's profiling runs, we exploit regression techniques to predict the applications\u2019 execution times and power consumption. Our detailed experimental evaluation using realistic workloads on our local cluster illustrates the working and benefits of our approach.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2019-12-01", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems", "pages": "2624-2635", "volume": "30"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "8982148", "name": "Stathis Maroulis"}, {"authorId": "2125879", "name": "Nikos Zacheilas"}, {"authorId": "1685532", "name": "V.
