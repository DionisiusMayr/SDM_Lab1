Firstly a P system is proposed. Then the new P system is introduced to design the optimization algorithm of BP neural network to achieve the malicious URL detection with better performance. In the end some examples are included and corresponding experimental results display the advantage and e \ufb00 ectiveness of the optimization algorithm proposed.", "venue": "IEICE Trans. Inf.
