This paper proposes one method of constructing the distribution network operation monitoring index system based on two aspects of operation efficiency and power supply capacity, and proposes a corresponding data analysis model for detailed analysis, and finally carries out the model verification. The experimental tests of four types of equipment operation analysis in the internal big data distribution network show that, the proposed methods could locate the distribution network operation quickly and accurately.", "venue": "Journal of Physics: Conference Series", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Physics"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2020-09-01", "journal": {"name": "Journal of Physics: Conference Series", "volume": "1631"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2131155556", "name": "Shi Liu"}, {"authorId": "47040665", "name": "Xin Ji"}, {"authorId": "2154968124", "name": "Xiaolong Zhao"}, {"authorId": "2183689265", "name": "Qian Wang"}, {"authorId": "2005066796", "name": "Zhongyi Shang"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "a4acdc8e93c398265de2e807a0a769013b995f4c", "title": "Status of power equipment in 10kV distribution network based on digital twin technology"}, {"paperId": "343928cacd4f4d3cef49ac5cff146d4f02a453a7", "title": "Correlation analysis of distribution network equipment decommissioning data based on three-dimensional matrix"}]}
