Many algorithms and systems have been proposed for subgraph matching. Most of these works follow Ullmann's backtracking approach as it is memory-efficient in handling an explosive number of intermediate matching results. However, they have largely overlooked an intrinsic problem of backtracking, namely repeated computation, which contributes to a large portion of the heavy computation in subgraph matching. This paper proposes a subgraph matching system, Circinus, which enables effective computation sharing by a new compression-based backtracking method. Our extensive experiments show that Circinus significantly reduces repeated computation, which transfers to up to several orders of magnitude performance improvement.", "venue": "Proc. ACM Manag.
