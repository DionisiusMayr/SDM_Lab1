Moving an implementation from one such system to another, e.g., for performance reasons, requires adapting existing applications to new interfaces. Apache Beam addresses these high substitution costs by providing an abstraction layer that enables executing programs on any of the supported streaming frameworks. In this paper, we present a novel benchmark architecture for comparing the performance impact of using Apache Beam on three streaming frameworks: Apache Spark Streaming, Apache Flink, and Apache Apex. We find significant performance penalties when using Apache Beam for application development in the surveyed systems. Overall, usage of Apache Beam for the examined streaming applications caused a high variance of query execution times with a slowdown of up to a factor of 58 compared to queries developed without the abstraction layer. All developed benchmark artifacts are publicly available to ensure reproducible results.", "venue": "IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2019-07-01", "journal": {"name": "2019 IEEE 39th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS)", "pages": "1381-1392"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "145358510", "name": "Ting Chen"}, {"authorId": "1387913799", "name": "Teng Hu"}, {"authorId": "3413969", "name": "Jiachi Chen"}, {"authorId": "9117563", "name": "Xiaosong Zhang"}, {"authorId": "1390752163", "name": "Zihao Li"}, {"authorId": "2108298315", "name": "Yufei Zhang"}, {"authorId": "1708419", "name": "Xiapu Luo"}, {"authorId": "30894196", "name": "Ang Chen"}, {"authorId": "144248298", "name": "Kun Yang"}, {"authorId": "2145118766", "name": "Bin Hu"}, {"authorId": "2072832837", "name": "Tong Zhu"}, {"authorId": "1392431816", "name": "Shifang Deng"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "721747f4479f1fca3c080669f8d9989f3b09bb4f", "title": "A systematic mapping of performance in distributed stream processing systems"}, {"paperId": "a0e4bcdb6d36475b3e03108e10f428e863142b3f", "title": "A Systemic Mapping of Methods and Tools for Performance Analysis of Data Streaming with Containerized Microservices Architecture"}, {"paperId": "240ce6a3c42ca5d34c1907335a89c0cc352099b7", "title": "Know Your Transactions: Real-time and Generic Transaction Semantic Representation on Blockchain & Web3 Ecosystem"}, {"paperId": "8f876c2a8f9766606fe18272535a728f3c04afc0", "title": "Benchmarking scalability of stream processing frameworks deployed as microservices in the cloud"}, {"paperId": "56af97ccd8cf0aaa7d5363c8fe6f78f0b8c595bb", "title": "Transformer-based comparative multi-view illegal transaction detection"}, {"paperId": "0069cab68c6fce8c3ea696fa5ccc83c9997d72d2", "title": "Web Service Multidimensional Data Mining in the Optimization Middleware of Secondary Guiding Management System in Private Colleges"}, {"paperId": "4d4652d7e72dbaf211c32ca2d21ab9cf11f6eb80", "title": "A Low-Load Distributed Stream Processing System for Continuous Conjunctive Normal Form Queries"}, {"paperId": "18e39b2da516a6284665aabbfde8cbfb8418c662", "title": "Applying blockchain-based method to smart contract classification for CPS applications"}, {"paperId": "0c3820f5fdd981e92fa909d1f298c13e954a329c", "title": "Streaming vs. Functions: A Cost Perspective on Cloud Event Processing"}, {"paperId": "4b4522973ec26385de102b8e2fab0dcffa86d755", "title": "Demystifying Ethereum account diversity: observations, models and analysis"}, {"paperId": "b78c4f6e49ea469a85bd7d5e669868e58fdc568b", "title": "A multi-level collaborative framework for elastic stream computing systems"}, {"paperId": "6d935c13aecb159143d05eb0f6c7b065d1b2add0", "title": "Scotty"}, {"paperId": "4219a49271985ebd7f875f3a763cb5429b368636", "title": "ESPBench: The Enterprise Stream Processing Benchmark"}, {"paperId": "ea3126ba6aa0cc530a5c92f4e252daf48b2bf13c", "title": "Transaction-based classification and detection approach for Ethereum smart contract"}, {"paperId": "7144be52f83b5d5db897afec9e4c34d1610d2756", "title": "XBlock-EOS: Extracting and Exploring Blockchain Data From EOSIO"}, {"paperId": "a7791ddb9e5d69a24a2f09c922a00cfda65964ef", "title": "Ethereum Analysis via Node Clustering"}, {"paperId": "6b9862af75dc9afe76b17d1ada50ffad47154975", "title": "Application of Data Stream Processing Technologies in Industry 4.0 - What is Missing?"}, {"paperId": "ab9a7dc0e236f585242cb4f62ca7ffe5671cdd30", "title": "2019 IEEE 39th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS)"}, {"paperId": "5c683362f4e1ac2488e744702bd129a00692bad6", "title": "Towards a First Step to Understand the Cryptocurrency Stealing Attack on Ethereum"}, {"paperId": "9d72f565947fbb06d8ba4c14943be3fe5608eb07", "title": "Table of Contents"}, {"paperId": "d01fa90ee9444121aaa3e814e4876598f593cd3f", "title": "Benchmarking scalability of stream processing frameworks deployed as event-driven microservices in the cloud"}, {"paperId": "2dd0f8d71aa49dbc378fc07152ed12e4e00c0dee", "title": "Scalability Benchmarking of Stream Processing Engines with Apache Beam"}, {"paperId": "cf4bcad671239eab762ee084089ad2452fadd3d1", "title": "Scotty: General and Efficient Open-Source Window Aggregation for Stream Processing Systems"}]}
