The explosion of the web and the abundance of linked data demand effective and ef\ufb01cient methods for storage, management, and querying. Apache Spark is one of the most widely used engines for big data processing, with more and more systems adopting it for ef\ufb01cient query answering. Existing approaches exploiting Spark for querying RDF data, adopt partitioning techniques for reducing the data that need to be accessed in order to improve ef\ufb01ciency. However, simplistic data partitioning fails, on one hand, to minimize data access and on the other hand to group data usually queried together. This is translated into limited improvement in terms of ef\ufb01ciency in query answering. In this paper, we present DIAERESIS, a novel platform that accepts as input an RDF dataset and effectively partitions it, minimizing data access and improving query answering ef\ufb01ciency. To achieve this, DIAERESIS \ufb01rst identi\ufb01es the top-k most important schema nodes, i.e., the most important classes, as centroids and distributes the other schema nodes to the centroid they mostly depend on. Then, it allocates the corresponding instance nodes to the schema nodes they are instantiated under. Our algorithm enables \ufb01ne-tuning of data distribution, signi\ufb01cantly reducing data access for query answering. We experimentally evaluate our approach using both synthetic and real workloads, strictly dominating existing state-of-the-art, showing that we improve query answering in several cases by orders of magnitude.", "venue": "", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2279222", "name": "Georgia Troullinou"}, {"authorId": "51039511", "name": "Giannis Agathangelos"}, {"authorId": "1821005", "name": "H.
