SummaryStore contributes time-decayed summaries, a novel abstraction for summarizing data streams, along with an ingest algorithm to continually merge the summaries for efficient range queries; in conjunction, it returns reliable error estimates alongside the approximate answers, supporting a range of machine learning and analytical workloads. We successfully evaluated SummaryStore using real-world applications for forecasting, outlier detection, and Internet traffic monitoring; it can summarize aggressively with low median errors, 0.1 to 10%, for different workloads. Under range-query microbenchmarks, it stored 1PB synthetic stream data (10241TB streams), on a single node, using roughly 10 TB (100x compaction) with 95%-ile error below 5% and median cold-cache query latency of 1.3s (worst case latency under 70s).", "venue": "Symposium on Operating Systems Principles", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2017-10-14", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 26th Symposium on Operating Systems Principles"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2132812674", "name": "Nitin Agrawal"}, {"authorId": "3002190", "name": "Ashish Vulimiri"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "2a57522a24304999c93f3e79625395055aa32d68", "title": "Resource-efficient In-orbit Detection of Earth Objects"}, {"paperId": "a9ba7e1ce9ae6266fc1befec0b0e4c79ca9323b6", "title": "Rethink Query Optimization in HTAP Databases"}, {"paperId": "e9c2b1d32ceef3b24bba1f9081018faabde83a19", "title": "Time Series Compression for IoT: A Systematic Literature Review"}, {"paperId": "edb0c0907548a72220ca375aeda8fe9d2cceea61", "title": "FlowKV: A Semantic-Aware Store for Large-Scale State Management of Stream Processing Engines"}, {"paperId": "ef956fa99c8030eec7a70a1b0e72c0a8e8bbd571", "title": "Edge intelligence secure frameworks: Current state and future challenges"}, {"paperId": "1e27ff3fd2a0ce3432af887115107c00443d9989", "title": "Machine Learning Platform for Extreme Scale Computing on Compressed IoT Data"}, {"paperId": "e48f8aed4997eaed9cff4d0ab06449ede6296ee3", "title": "MDZ: An Efficient Error-bounded Lossy Compressor for Molecular Dynamics"}, {"paperId": "a97b2ed4207da2817f419b67ed3fb285911ef401", "title": "ProSPECT: Proactive Storage Using Provenance for Efficient Compute and Tiering"}, {"paperId": "00484d239713ec9daf91b89637342f86025c27c5", "title": "TSCache: An Efficient Flash-based Caching Scheme for Time-series Data Workloads"}, {"paperId": "5929a2b0b6a256a08917a39bc2ae298cd4759c67", "title": "Fine-Grained Multi-Query Stream Processing on Integrated Architectures"}, {"paperId": "76f2e77d98f9f243e4ab65318b00e04e4ee6078a", "title": "IoTDataBench: Extending TPCx-IoT for Compression and Scalability"}, {"paperId": "c9b0db2ed2aafcce6f5e42082c4031c52db11a51", "title": "Scalable Multiway Stream Joins in Hardware"}, {"paperId": "3229bd866b9d7d44a00a03b1ca320967d97b182c", "title": "Approximate Query Service on Autonomous IoT Cameras."}, {"paperId": "8ece8bee7ad1f910c8d2cf6a76c63e25235b20c5", "title": "EdgeDB: An Efficient Time-Series Database for Edge Computing"}, {"paperId": "92c8c1eb8976e2e49fcded4d6b4e5bce557ee37d", "title": "Approximate query service on autonomous IoT cameras"}, {"paperId": "400feb0d8fda8ef36097f807c127105a050a647b", "title": "Approximate Query Processing on Autonomous Cameras"}, {"paperId": "ac56ae746482b9e6ad3177f15f26d4f3904f9d42", "title": "Fast and accurate stream processing by filtering the cold"}, {"paperId": "ae1eb998779821e59ede9d554d786ec273afb076", "title": "Supporting Video Queries on Zero-Streaming Cameras"}, {"paperId": "8cbf447424fd054475f970c5786af2a7a3892e6b", "title": "TimeCrypt: Encrypted Data Stream Processing at Scale with Cryptographic Access Control"}, {"paperId": "2bc0a05c932b9982165e2e61a5550fc6f984651f", "title": "TimeCrypt: A Scalable Private Time Series Data Store"}, {"paperId": "78150d0f113679dcd7525c244488148ba762b12c", "title": "VStore: A Data Store for Analytics on Large Videos"}, {"paperId": "82ca3416b8382bc760f0b40b343e16d95c3d0004", "title": "A Software Cache Mechanism for Reducing the OpenTSDB Query Time"}, {"paperId": "43b4714b9fcb4c36b9c59dc1f183bc4ace9a0941", "title": "High-Performance Stateful Stream Processing on Solid-State Drives"}, {"paperId": "3e98d83c6fb4e343463d9456669a6242ce029b0f", "title": "ModelarDB: Integrated Model-Based Management of Time Series from Edge to Cloud"}, {"paperId": "dda986751968714074431c1c5f8abd09da31aad0", "title": "Retrofitting High Availability Mechanism to Tame Hybrid Transaction/Analytical Processing"}, {"paperId": "82e42ec3fdb7d76fdd3804b1b18bc01a5ee58cd4", "title": "FineStream: Fine-Grained Window-Based Stream Processing on CPU-GPU Integrated Architectures"}, {"paperId": "3fa4c110b5ded8487af1bf6ac417790f1e61a454", "title": "INSIDER: Designing In-Storage Computing System for Emerging High-Performance Drive"}, {"paperId": "ba788d5665dad1227b5459881719b1ef261db935", "title": "Hardware Accelerated Stream Processing"}, {"paperId": "da40ea03672b9cdbdc906cee7529f22da6a46792", "title": "Learning with Less: Can Approximate Storage Systems Save Learning From Drowning in Data?"}, {"paperId": "5cdb8c1c59552635b5390157b71ac99c16f2b93b", "title": "This paper is included in the Proceedings of the 14th USENIX Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation"}]}
