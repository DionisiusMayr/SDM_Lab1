But between the shell's inherent challenges and neglect from the community, shell tooling and performance lags far behind the state of the art. We propose executing scripts out-of-order to better use modern computational resources. Optimizing any part of an arbitrary shell script is very challenging: the shell language's complex, late-bound semantics makes extensive use of opaque external commands with arbitrary side effects. We work with the grain of the shell's challenges, meeting dynamism with dynamism: we optimize at runtime, speculatively executing commands in an isolated and monitored environment to determine and contain their behavior. Our proposed approach can yield serious performance benefits (up to 3.9\u00d7 for a bioinformatics script on a 16-core machine) for arbitrarily complex scripts without modifying their behavior. Contained out-of-order execution obviates the need for command specifications, operates on external commands, and yields a much more general framework for the shell. Script writers need not change a thing and observe no differences: they get improved performance with the interpretability of sequential output.", "venue": "USENIX Workshop on Hot Topics in Operating Systems", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-06-22", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 19th Workshop on Hot Topics in Operating Systems"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2140249135", "name": "Georgios Liargkovas"}, {"authorId": "91973722", "name": "Konstantinos Kallas"}, {"authorId": "144295440", "name": "M.
