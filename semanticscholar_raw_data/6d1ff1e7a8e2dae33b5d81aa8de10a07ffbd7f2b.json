Mobile edge computing (MEC) and blockchain technology can significantly improve the quality of service, security, and privacy protection in WBANs. In this paper, we propose an improved computation offloading approach integrating multi\u2010attribute decision\u2010making and the highest response ratio next (HRRN) algorithm (MDMH) to optimize network performance and resource allocation in MEC\u2010enabled WBANs. When tasks are waiting in a queue for execution, the developed HRRN algorithm is designed to solve the starvation problem of low\u2010priority tasks. Moreover, we employ both analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the multi\u2010attribute decision\u2010making method to select the proper MEC server to guarantee better network performance in mobile scenarios. Comparing with other computation offloading approaches, the simulation results show that the proposed MDMH approach can effectively and efficiently reduce the traffic delay with different user priorities, optimize the communication and computing resource usage in WBANs, and achieve various energy saving goals.", "venue": "Transactions on Emerging Telecommunications Technologies", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-09-02", "journal": {"name": "Transactions on Emerging Telecommunications Technologies", "volume": "32"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2115845381", "name": "Xiaoming Yuan"}, {"authorId": "19448257", "name": "Zheyu Zhao"}, {"authorId": "2116381936", "name": "Haiyang Wang"}, {"authorId": "2145398241", "name": "Lin Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2848485", "name": "Amirhosein Taherkordi"}, {"authorId": "2118681912", "name": "Huaizhou Yu"}], "citations": []}
