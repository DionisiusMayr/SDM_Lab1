This paper proposes an enhancement to the distributed storage system to address large network environments where many network nodes are connected to multiple network switches. In the proposed method, the latency time when a network frame travels on the network is evaluated together with the effective performance of the storage, and this is used to determine the destination of the data block. Simulation evaluation results show that in the networks with cascading multiple network switches and high I/O load on storage, the performance improvement is significantly greater than that of the previous method. This showed that our storage system can provide sufficient performance improvement even in large network environments.", "venue": "2022 23rd ACIS International Summer Virtual Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking and Parallel/Distributed Computing (SNPD-Summer)", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-07-01", "journal": {"name": "2022 23rd ACIS International Summer Virtual Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking and Parallel/Distributed Computing (SNPD-Summer)", "pages": "87-94"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3053191", "name": "Atsushi Nunome"}, {"authorId": "50378473", "name": "Hiroaki Hirata"}], "citations": []}
