The complete KDD process can be applied over raw input dataset to identify the analytical observations. Various feature selection methods, clustering and classification algorithms are proposed by the researchers to improve the accuracy. In this paper, a descriptive study of advance work carried out in various associated work stages of KDD process. The paper has recognized the contribution of researchers with effective observation on methodology, scope and significance of their contribution. The paper has explored the various functional stages of data processing including data cleaning, feature generation, clustering, classification and outlier detection. Each stage is here described with descriptive approach, significance, application domain and the relative scope.", "venue": "", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "14802240", "name": "Dhiraj Khurana"}, {"authorId": "46183396", "name": "Sunita Dhingra"}], "citations": []}
