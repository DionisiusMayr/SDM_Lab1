Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted during the government-enforced lockdown. A validated, online, questionnaire was used to collect information about dietary and lifestyle habits. The Mediterranean diet adherence screener (MEDAS) was used to assess adherence to the MD. Results A total of 1684 participants responded to the survey. Their mean age was 23.92 \u00b1 7.62 years, and 70.4% were females. Approximately a third of the participants reported that their dietary habits did not change and 42.3% acknowledged that their eating habits deteriorated during the lockdown. Participants smoked less and slept more during the lockdown compared to before it. Approximately 19.2% of the sample reported low adherence to the MD whereas 63.9% and 16.9% described moderate and high adherence respectively. Only age was significantly associated with higher MD adherence. Conclusion Dietary intake and MD adherence were suboptimal during the COVID-19 lockdown among the sample of the Lebanese population. It is critical that the Lebanese government implements public health programs in order to promote awareness about the importance of adhering to a healthy lifestyle and making appropriate dietary and lifestyle choices.", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-04-19", "journal": {"name": "PLOS ONE", "volume": "18"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "35393238", "name": "Suzan A Haidar"}, {"authorId": "40834939", "name": "M.
