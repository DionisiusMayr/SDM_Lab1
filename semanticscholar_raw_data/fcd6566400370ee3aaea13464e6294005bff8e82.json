Intelligent resource management, orchestration, and prediction systems can optimize the deployment of services, adapt to changing demands, and ensure that the services are running smoothly. This paper introduces a novel architectural paradigm capable of facilitating multi-domain edge orchestration for highly distributed immersive services by incorporating a plethora of AI solutions and technological enablers that can support multi-domain edge deployments. The proposed architecture is designed to operate on the basis of multi-level specification blueprints, which decouple the simple high-level user-intent infrastructure definition from the AI-driven orchestration and the final execution plan. The Application Management Framework (AMF) offers a visual language and tool that can be used as an alternative to a formal method for creating the intent blueprint. In the frame of this work, the latter is validated by an immersive virtual touring use-case scenario.", "venue": "International Conference on Edge Computing [Services Society]", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-07-01", "journal": {"name": "2023 IEEE International Conference on Edge Computing and Communications (EDGE)", "pages": "381-392"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3321235", "name": "Tarik Zakaria Benmerar"}, {"authorId": "47189527", "name": "T.
