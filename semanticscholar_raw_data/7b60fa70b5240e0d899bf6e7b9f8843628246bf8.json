Each of these computing paradigms has its own pros and cons. Cloud computing provides enhanced data storage and computing power but causes high communication latency. Edge and fog computing provide similar services with lower latency but with limited capacity, capability, and coverage. A single computing paradigm cannot fulfil all the requirements of IoT devices and a federation between them is needed to extend their capacity, capability, and services. This federation is beneficial to both subscribers and providers and also reveals research issues in traffic offloading between clouds, edges, and fogs. Optimization has traditionally been used to solve the problem of traffic offloading. However, in such a complex federated system, traditional optimization cannot keep up with the strict latency requirements of decision making, ranging from milliseconds to sub-seconds. Machine learning approaches, especially reinforcement learning, are consequently becoming popular because they can quickly solve offloading problems in dynamic environments with large amounts of unknown information. This study provides a novel federal classification between cloud, edge, and fog and presents a comprehensive research roadmap on offloading for different federated scenarios. We survey the relevant literature on the various optimization approaches used to solve this offloading problem, and compare their salient features. We then provide a comprehensive survey on offloading in federated systems with machine learning approaches and the lessons learned as a result of these surveys. Finally, we outline several directions for future research and challenges that have to be faced in order to achieve such a federation.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-02-22", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2202.10628"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2379433", "name": "Binayak Kar"}, {"authorId": "9698973", "name": "Widhi Yahya"}, {"authorId": "1682210", "name": "Ying-Dar Lin"}, {"authorId": "2112249036", "name": "Asad Ali"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "d13efe23f296c155868fbd06c6e7135a12cb6e4e", "title": "Intelligent Computation Offloading Based on Digital Twin-Enabled 6G Industrial IoT"}, {"paperId": "de04f43ccbf26b288adc22d50c5a11a3cef92196", "title": "VMAP: Matching-based Efficient Offloading in IoT-Fog Environments with Variable Resources"}, {"paperId": "0d8f80c6b2f0eb2609f9f964b3153b17d2655a85", "title": "Towards Characterization of Edge-Cloud Continuum"}, {"paperId": "37d77a8cc5fb01d41754e04c460bc4ad486e83e6", "title": "Energy-Efficient Task Offloading for Three-Tier Wireless-Powered Mobile-Edge Computing"}, {"paperId": "b23268234c79cc1d448863d7f3313b93c7594d3a", "title": "Review on data replication strategies in single vs. interconnected cloud systems: Focus on data correlation\u2010aware strategies"}, {"paperId": "1bf18508fd36a76a726250c7f7630656f8ca0b62", "title": "Cost optimization of omnidirectional offloading in two-tier cloud-edge federated systems"}, {"paperId": "a39faf704f6e86434a08acaa1f33560d590a5953", "title": "Cognitive and Time Predictable Task Scheduling in Edge-cloud Federation"}, {"paperId": "00f10f86f8379084e777ab6a7291cb72d61d7ad7", "title": "DRL-Based Distributed Task Offloading Framework in Edge-Cloud Environment"}, {"paperId": "e408af9c5f68beb9838532405cd0abba86681cb9", "title": "Offloading Mechanisms Based on Reinforcement Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms in the Fog Computing Environment"}, {"paperId": "856a6007e92c1e950f93bdea1a7a11a7138c3a06", "title": "Routing-Based Interference Mitigation in SDN Enabled Beyond 5G Communication Networks: A Comprehensive Survey"}, {"paperId": "123d1656d51e09f5f1d779e4f0d636fd2aab145a", "title": "OPTIMAL OMNIDIRECTIONAL OFFLOADING IN FEDERATED CLOUD-FOG SYSTEMS WITH COST MINIMIZATION"}]}
