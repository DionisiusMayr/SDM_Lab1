Our algorithmic improvements reduce the memory footprint by 24 \u00d7 and the number of memory accesses by 12 \u00d7. We efficiently parallelize the algorithm for GPUs, achieving a 4.1 \u00d7 speedup over a CPU implementation of the same algorithm, a 62\u00d7 speedup over minimap2's CPU-based KSW2 and a 7.2 \u00d7 speedup over the CPU-based Edlib for long reads.", "venue": "IEEE International Symposium on Parallel & Distributed Processing, Workshops and Phd Forum", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-03-28", "journal": {"name": "2022 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops (IPDPSW)", "pages": "162-162"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2160629076", "name": "Joel Lindegger"}, {"authorId": "70029851", "name": "Damla Senol Cali"}, {"authorId": "3387282", "name": "M.
