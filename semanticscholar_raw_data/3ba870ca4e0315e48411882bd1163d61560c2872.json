However, these systems can experience various problems, including hardware and software-related anomalies. On the other hand, conventional fault detection and diagnosis techniques mostly depend on pre-established lists of fault alarms resulting in the potential for anomalous occurrences that defy these fault classifications. This study presents a novel unsupervised approach for detecting anomalous zones in variable air volume (VAV) air handling units (AHUs). The method utilizes autoencoders (AE) and principal component analysis (PCA), based on zone-level trend logs. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a case study was conducted using data collected from a 71-zone VAV AHU system of an educational building in Ottawa, Canada. The proposed PCA-AE method successfully identified four anomalous zones by considering four zone-level trend logs. The findings demonstrated great adaptability for detecting a wide range of zone anomalies in VAV AHUs giving operators valuable insights about the system and notify of potential faults at early stage.", "venue": "BuildSys@SenSys", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-11-15", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 10th ACM International Conference on Systems for Energy-Efficient Buildings, Cities, and Transportation"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2265276481", "name": "Arya Parsaei"}, {"authorId": "3149011", "name": "Burak Gunay"}, {"authorId": "2265278389", "name": "William O'Brien"}, {"authorId": "10123725", "name": "R.
