A general scheme and a symbolic description of implementing negative impacts (NI) in the ITE are presented. The concept of an integrated model for implementing NI in ITE, which is the basis for developing a safety monitor, is presented. For the complex model it is proposing the information and navigation model of the state and location of unmanned vehicles (UVs) in an intelligent transport (smart city) environment. The structure and the description of information and navigation elements (units and modules of the navigation subsystem) of the UVs, as well as a scheme of using data for local and global navigation in the UVs, are presented. The basic structural elements of information and navigation support of a smart city, types and layers of interaction, possible communication technologies and systems, and information support infrastructure are described. The synthesized information and navigation model for the UVs in the smart city environment is proposed.", "venue": "2023 International Russian Automation Conference (RusAutoCon)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-09-10", "journal": {"name": "2023 International Russian Automation Conference (RusAutoCon)", "pages": "453-459"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "50376789", "name": "Elena Jharko"}, {"authorId": "2267937027", "name": "E.
