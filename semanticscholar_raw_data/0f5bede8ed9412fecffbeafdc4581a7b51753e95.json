FPGAs as accelerators for graph processing with a customizable memory hierarchy promise solving performance problems caused by inherent irregular memory access patterns on traditional hardware (e.g., CPU). However, developing such hardware accelerators is yet time-consuming and difficult and benchmarking is non-standardized, hindering comprehension of the impact of memory access pattern changes and systematic engineering of graph processing accelerators. \nIn this work, we propose a simulation environment for the analysis of graph processing accelerators based on simulating their memory access patterns. Further, we evaluate our approach on two state-of-the-art FPGA graph processing accelerators and show reproducibility, comparablity, as well as the shortened development process by an example. Not implementing the cycle-accurate internal data flow on accelerator hardware like FPGAs significantly reduces the implementation time, increases the benchmark parameter transparency, and allows comparison of graph processing approaches.", "venue": "Datenbanksysteme f\u00fcr Business, Technologie und Web", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-10-26", "journal": {"pages": "101-122"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1411128014", "name": "Jonas Dann"}, {"authorId": "144405144", "name": "Daniel Ritter"}, {"authorId": "1731123", "name": "H.
