Discrete element method (DEM) at the macroscale was used to simulate the motion of the balls and powders during milling in a planetary ball mill. It was concluded that the milling speed had the powerful effect on the media motion. An increase of the speed led to a change of the particles distribution. The obtained results show that the DEM simulations is a powerful tool to process optimization and equipment design.", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "102972620", "name": "M.
