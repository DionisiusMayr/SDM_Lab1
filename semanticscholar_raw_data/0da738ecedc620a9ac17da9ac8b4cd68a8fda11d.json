The BIM model is a total brand-new graphic model that contains information. By analyzing the vulnerabilities of each component, an index system for the vulnerability evaluation is constructed; vulnerability is determined by the combined effect of many factors only by analyzing and also sorting out the interrelationship between factors can grasp the internal laws of the system and construct a hierarchical system of vulnerability indicators. By using the data mining technology and multimedia assisted BIM, the proposed system is constructed. The experiment results have proven the performance of the model.", "venue": "International Congress on Information and Communication Technology", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2021-01-20", "journal": {"name": "2021 6th International Conference on Inventive Computation Technologies (ICICT)", "pages": "1194-1197"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "72609644", "name": "Wanbo Qu"}], "citations": []}
