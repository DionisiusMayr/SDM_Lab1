With new communities constantly emerging and serving as ideological birthplaces, battlegrounds, and bunkers, it is critical to develop a framework for understanding worldviews and ideological distinction. Most existing work, however, takes a predetermined view based on political polarization: the \u201cright vs. left\u201d dichotomy of U.S. politics. In reality, both political polarization \u2013 and worldviews more broadly \u2013 transcend one-dimensional difference, and deserve a more complete analysis. Extending the ability of word embedding models to capture the semantic and cultural characteristics of their training corpora, we propose a novel method for discovering the multifaceted ideological and worldview characteristics of communities. Using over 1B comments collected from the largest communities on Reddit.com representing ~40% of Reddit activity, we demonstrate the efficacy of this approach to uncover complex ideological differences across multiple axes of polarization.", "venue": "Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"pages": "4832-4845"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2139750731", "name": "Jeremiah Milbauer"}, {"authorId": "2142533219", "name": "Adarsh Mathew"}, {"authorId": "144002439", "name": "James A.
