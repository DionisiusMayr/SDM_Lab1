It is, therefore, essential to test these systems to uncover any potential anomalies, which if not detected can lead to failure and/or cause loss or injury. Adequate or complete coverage of behaviours can be difficult to accomplish in CPS. We advocate a less expensive and easy-to-evaluate representation of the system via surrogate modelling. In this paper, we present a novel predictive fault modelling framework leveraging surrogate-based Digital Twin for probing for likely faults that can support software analysts and testers of CPS in their testing plans. The approach abstracts the CPS and uses a variant of Recurrent Neural Network known as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) surrogate model for forecasting. The forecasting can help in predicting multiple behaviours of the system components and the likely faults of systems under test; observations will consequently feed into the testing plans. Both direct and iterative (i.e. one-time and multiple-time varying steps) forecasting are supported as part of the framework. We evaluate our surrogate-based Digital Twins predictive modelling approach on two CPSs namely: water distribution system and air pollution detection system. The results show that our approach performed decently in predicting multiple time steps.", "venue": "2022 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Big Data Computing, Applications and Technologies (BDCAT)", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-12-01", "journal": {"name": "2022 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Big Data Computing, Applications and Technologies (BDCAT)", "pages": "166-169"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "51249067", "name": "H.
