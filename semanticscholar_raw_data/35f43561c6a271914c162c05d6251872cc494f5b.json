Data authorities can establish authorizations regulating access to their data distinguishing three visibility levels (no visibility, encrypted visibility, and plaintext visibility). Authorizations are enforced in the query execution by possibly restricting operation assignments to other parties and by adjusting visibility of data on-the-fly. Our approach enables users and data authorities to fully enjoy the benefits and economic savings of the competitive open cloud market, while maintaining control over data.", "venue": "Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2017-11-01", "journal": {"name": "Proc.
