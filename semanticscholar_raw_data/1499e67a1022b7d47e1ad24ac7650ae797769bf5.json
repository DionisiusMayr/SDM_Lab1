Many authors\u00a0are also becoming interested in the data revolution that is enhancing the way we study and understand cities. It now becomes appropriate to respond to this need in an evidence-informed manner by working with stakeholders to encourage a more resilient approach via education for the younger enthusiast, leading to more transparent, improved, sustainable and safer urban cities. However, the major challenge we foresee is the inability to utilize the large amount of urban data generated daily. With the drive to mobilize more education towards urban data science and analytics, generated data can be effectively utilized to make informed and evidence-based decisions. This paper points to a practical methodology for reproducibility, the key steps taken, as it views the inclusion of an Urban Data Science curriculum as priceless, and a decision that will bring into notice the importance of engaging the younger generation in scholastic learning on data principles and analytics. Data along with spatial enhancement can be the driving factor towards improving data-driven policy-making for solving urban problems in smart cities. \n\u00a0 \n\u00a0", "venue": "Journal of Education Society and Behavioural Science", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-05-13", "journal": {"name": "Journal of Education, Society and Behavioural Science"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "104618562", "name": "S.
