Collecting the data perceived by sensing devices in a fast and energy-saving style is critical for building a stable network in IoT. In this paper, we propose an Early Message Ahead Join Adaptive Data Aggregation (E-ADA) scheme for IoT. Firstly, an advance notification mechanism based on early message is introduced to improve the probability of data aggregation, thus optimizing energy consumption and network lifetime. In this mechanism, the routing of early message is faster than that of the data packet. Nodes with data packet send an early message forward to notice, and other data packets which monitor the early message can wait for that to aggregate under the delay deadline constraints. Secondly, we propose a Delay-optimized Convergence Routing based E-ADA (DOCR-E-ADA) data collection scheme which combines advance notification mechanism and convergence routings. The duty cycle of nodes in convergence routing is adaptively adjusted, which greatly reduces transmission latency. Finally, extensive experimental results demonstrate that our DOCR-E-ADA outperforms the existing schemes in terms of network delay and lifetime.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-01-01", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering", "pages": "201-219", "volume": "8"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2076164763", "name": "Ouyang Yan"}, {"authorId": "34389367", "name": "Anfeng Liu"}, {"authorId": "145826495", "name": "N.
