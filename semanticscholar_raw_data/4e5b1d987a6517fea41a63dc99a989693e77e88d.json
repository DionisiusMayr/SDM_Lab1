The most fragile and important organ in the human body is the brain. The imagination, hearing, listening, perception, and other senses are under the control of the central nervous system. According to statistics from the World Health Organization, brain tumors will account for roughly 10 million deaths globally in 2020. This article offers a thorough examination of current strategies that deliver the highest results in their respective industries. The proposed CNN model using Pooling algorithm such as Average Pooling, Max Pooling, and Global Average Pooling. Different classifiers can be used to extract useful features from the MRI images.", "venue": "2023 5th International Conference on Inventive Research in Computing Applications (ICIRCA)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-08-03", "journal": {"name": "2023 5th International Conference on Inventive Research in Computing Applications (ICIRCA)", "pages": "323-330"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2235574194", "name": "Nadenlla RajamohanReddy"}, {"authorId": "2268071259", "name": "G.
