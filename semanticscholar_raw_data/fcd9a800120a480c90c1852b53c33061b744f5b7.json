This study does a thorough assessment of the literature to determine the most common cyberattacks and the effects they have on UAV assaults on civilian targets. The STRIDE assault paradigm, the challenge they present, and the proper tools for the attack are used to categorize the cyber dangers discussed in this paper. Spoofing and denial of service assaults are the most prevalent types of UAV cyberattacks and have the best results. No attack style demands the employment of a hard-to-reach gadget, indicating that the security environment currently necessitates improvements to UAV use in civilian applications.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-12-09", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2212.05028"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2066213174", "name": "T.
