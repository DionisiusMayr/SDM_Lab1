There is a growing need to teach individuals and assist them in transitioning to longer-term employment prospects to execute Industry 4.0 effectively. Although MOOCs revolutionized the way learners study, it is critical to investigate teaching techniques using Education 4.0 at this time. This article explores how the technologies of Industry 4.0 can be incorporated into MOOCs. This paper proposes MOOCs 5.0, whose features include better universal access, better learner engagement, adaptive learning, greater collaboration, security, and curiosity, which is being developed using Industry 4.0 technologies of the Internet of Things, Cloud Computing, Big Data, Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning, Blockchain, Gamification Technologies, and the Metaverse and would incorporate the zones of ethics and humanism, while at the same time providing learners with a richer and more individualized experience.", "venue": "Sustainability", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-09-07", "journal": {"name": "Sustainability"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "35638706", "name": "Ishteyaaq Ahmad"}, {"authorId": "2135768268", "name": "Sonal Sharma"}, {"authorId": "49121016", "name": "Rajesh Singh"}, {"authorId": "9280578", "name": "Anita Gehlot"}, {"authorId": "51281171", "name": "Neeraj Priyadarshi"}, {"authorId": "2662511", "name": "Bhekisipho Twala"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "240df2cdf5baf6c259a7a80519e88ddb281f2e62", "title": "Inclusive learning using industry 4.0 technologies: addressing student diversity in modern education"}, {"paperId": "45fc5593d63438f43d6c3ee1b68696ff0dcbf846", "title": "AI in Classrooms"}, {"paperId": "3990633e703db83c54953a5d191de1cfacd7b1ab", "title": "Modelling Bitcoin networks in terms of anonymity and privacy in the metaverse application within Industry 5.0: Comprehensive taxonomy, unsolved issues and suggested solution"}, {"paperId": "c0413146cd3aa80021b05a720cc56b379ba073c2", "title": "Multitrack Educational Programs as a Method of Educational Process Personalization at Universities"}, {"paperId": "5b40723715a823833300808979181bf80012fca0", "title": "CLOUD TECHNOLOGIES IN EDUCATION: THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC REVIEW"}, {"paperId": "51ee5fd4140540857a6c00c5186d94223f4d0d84", "title": "A Review of the Factors Influencing Users' Perception of Metaverse Security and Trust"}, {"paperId": "b760e05fb2550ca017e08d28ff0c419311c2c11e", "title": "A mesters\u00e9ges intelligencia szerepe az online vizsg\u00e1ztat\u00e1sban"}, {"paperId": "1692534a955a63528ff75d194fa5b5cf493444d8", "title": "Revolutionizing educational landscapes: A systematic review of Metaverse applications, paradigms and emerging technologies"}, {"paperId": "64c18eecd918b8ed36c0a82dc2287df405400395", "title": "Blockchain Technology in Rejuvenating the Media & Entertainment Sector"}, {"paperId": "326bb4c75b7a08cf4b22c1e87a0429077d8086f0", "title": "Intervention of AI in Prediction of Judgement of Cases"}, {"paperId": "94febba98d2c600c23b1f950859b6a920e9e35ea", "title": "Intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Entertainment Sector"}, {"paperId": "ee1f2e4e977eb2fd79c40b6f55ffd346661afed5", "title": "Designing Immersive Gamified Experiences in the Metaverse for Enhanced Student Learning"}, {"paperId": "1cfcba5655c48268bd64b2caa7f7d73f04d2082b", "title": "Exhilarating Growth in Education Through Artificial Intelligence"}, {"paperId": "987fe0c261ae39eba15aca805a6975c7a5fd8788", "title": "Usage Status, Usage Requirements, and Satisfaction in Using Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) for General Education Courses at Rajamangala University of Technology Srivijaya"}, {"paperId": "002d0ea4b64fae3c48a55556c7507bf1ce723052", "title": "Research on the development of an effective mechanism of using public online education resource platform: TOE model combined with FS-QCA"}, {"paperId": "598f133f066909a779c67f5f9dec5cc142ffe4d7", "title": "Pedagogy 4.0: Employability Skills and Computer Aided Design (CAD) Education for Industry 4.0"}, {"paperId": "9b432244ef173ab2522c32f8375b07eba78a4462", "title": "Factors Influencing the Establishment of Clothing Retailers in the Metaverse: The Role of Metaverse Technology as a Mediator"}, {"paperId": "67fafa7f1c0c3e52a7f6bc63e97194cbfbeeaa3e", "title": "Education 5.0: Requirements, Enabling Technologies, and Future Directions"}, {"paperId": "eb83daf13d15dc6bf62d70909c4c1bb50e44c1ea", "title": "Banking Industry's Transformation with Aid of AI Technology"}, {"paperId": "c5023d35a4a69a7c7cd67c543f90bb0a1f74a166", "title": "Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises Advancement with Artificial Intelligence and Robots"}, {"paperId": "c70424ebb8c0af1f44d325f84dc53df49e1578a8", "title": "SWAYAM MOOC Reviews: Assessing Acceptability through Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning"}, {"paperId": "785e18a371e170825f78125dcf28ae74e6ced078", "title": "Mapping Metaverse Research: Identifying Future Research Areas Based on Bibliometric and Topic Modeling Techniques"}, {"paperId": "944b34699122d6fa7c0d25f94f12538e1044a303", "title": "Study on the Recent Development of Metaverse Application in College Teaching"}, {"paperId": "72ba0a363a7a068338bbdf84cf1244adaccf451b", "title": "The foundation for future education, teaching, training, learning, and performing infrastructure -
