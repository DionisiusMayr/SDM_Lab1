Before outlining the practical use of 4CAT, we discuss three \u201caffordances\u201d that informed its design: modularity, transparency, and traceability. 4CAT is modular because new data sources and analytical processors can be easily added and changed; transparent because it aims to render legible its inner workings; and traceable because of automatic and shareable documentation of intermediate analysis steps. We then show how 4CAT operationalizes these features through a description of its general setup and a short walkthrough. Finally, we discuss how 4CAT strives for an \u201cethics by design\u201d development philosophy that enables ethically sound data-driven research with it. 4CAT is then positioned as both an answer to and a further call for \u201ctool criticism\u201d in computational social research.", "venue": "Social Science Research Network", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2021-08-31", "journal": {"name": "SSRN Electronic Journal"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "104470945", "name": "S.C.J.
