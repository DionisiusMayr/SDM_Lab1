In our scheme, the proposed network plays the role of a dealer and treats the secret-sharing process as a classification issue. The key idea is to view the secret as an image during the secret-sharing process. If the user\u2019s private key is text, we can covert the key text into an image called the original image. Specifically, we first divide the original image into original subimages by the image segmentation. Next, we encode each original subimage by DNA coding. Finally, we train the proposed network to find the key secret-sharing results. Our proposed scheme is not only a significant extension of the GANs but also a new direction for the key secret-sharing technology. The simulation results show that the scheme is secure, and both flexible and efficient in communication.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer
