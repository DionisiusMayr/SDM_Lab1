SLAOrchestrator is designed for SLAs that guarantee per-query execution times. Its core architecture consists of a double learning loop that improves both SLAs and resource management over time. It further utilizes an efficient combination of elastic query scheduling and multi-tenant resource provisioning algorithms to reduce the costs of performance guarantees.", "venue": "", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "144928800", "name": "Jennifer Ortiz"}, {"authorId": "2110106875", "name": "Brendan Lee"}, {"authorId": "1718134", "name": "M.
