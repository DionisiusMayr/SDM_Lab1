Alzheimer\u2019s is a fatal brain disease that severely damages the human brain, especially in the elderly. One way to prevent Alzheimer's disease is by detecting it early. The proposed research employs a deep learning methodology using a 3D convolutional neural network (3D CNN) that has been proposed to detect Alzheimer's disease at an early stage. The proposed model is primarily evaluated using three-dimensional brain images. A series of preprocessing have been applied that is an advanced normalization tool (ANT). The underlying pattern has a size of 128\u00d7128\u00d764 and is passed to 17 layers of a neural network that is 3D-CNN. Another contribution of this study is the conversion of a 3D Alzheimer\u2019s image into a 2D image. A 2D convolutional neural network such that RestNET50 and VGG16 are proposed to be used for Alzheimer\u2019s detection. The proposed model has attained the highest of 78.07% accuracy using 3D CNN.", "venue": "Journal of Independent Studies and Research - Computing", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-06-07", "journal": {"name": "Journal of Independent Studies and Research Computing"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2113948864", "name": "Muhammad Wasim"}, {"authorId": "101783402", "name": "Affan Alim"}, {"authorId": "2073127375", "name": "Waqas Ahmed"}], "citations": []}
