Technologies and large-scale infrastructures provide stakeholders with computing capacity and data services to perform unprecedented levels of data-driven scientific activities. This opens the way to science gateways and virtual research environments (VREs) supporting researchers in scientific and educational activities. This article describes our extensive experience with the VREs operated by the D4Science infrastructure. It presents how this infrastructure supports their development and their basic functionalities as well as how they are easily customized to serve the needs of specific user communities. It also describes how they are used in real contexts. The article concludes by reporting how VREs are now progressively used as valuable instruments to support open science and how this role might become more relevant in the future.", "venue": "Computing in science & engineering (Print)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-03-01", "journal": {"name": "Computing in Science & Engineering", "pages": "12-19", "volume": "25"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "145679761", "name": "Leonardo Candela"}, {"authorId": "1773869", "name": "D.
