This chapter describes the mechanisms ELG has put in place to build interoperable bridges to related initiatives, infrastructures, platforms and repositories in the wider Language Technology landscape. We focus on the different approaches implemented for the exchange of metadata records about, in a generic sense, resources and exemplify them with the help of four use cases through which the ELG catalogue has been further populated. The chapter presents the protocols used for the population processes as well as the adaptations of the ELG metadata schema and platform policies that proved necessary to be able to ingest these new records. Last, we discuss the challenges emerging in large-scale metadata aggregation processes and propose a number of alternative options to address them.", "venue": "", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2884435", "name": "Penny Labropoulou"}, {"authorId": "2954279", "name": "Stelios Piperidis"}, {"authorId": "3402842", "name": "Miltos Deligiannis"}, {"authorId": "2081604490", "name": "Leon Voukoutis"}, {"authorId": "2191022106", "name": "Maria"}, {"authorId": "2191024373", "name": "Giagkou"}, {"authorId": "2100537892", "name": "Ond\u0159ej Ko\u0161arko"}, {"authorId": "144002335", "name": "Jan Hajic"}, {"authorId": "2156673", "name": "Georg Rehm"}], "citations": []}
