These techniques enable wrapping data with an encryptionbased layer of protection when they are stored, accessed, and processed in the data market. The techniques described in this document focus, in particular, on: 1) the controlled, on-the-fly and selective, application of encryption to protect confidential information in data processing and computation, and 2) the application of an All-Or-Nothing Transform encryption mode, combined with fragmentation and slicing, for protecting data in storage, while ensuring resilience to failures, and strong protection even in case of key leakage, and 3) the owner-controlled wrapping of data when ingested in the digital market for enriching data with a self-protecting layer to enforce authorizations.
