Currently, data cubes and cloud computing show promise in facilitating data storage and data processing owing to their exceptional scalability, elasticity, and cost-efficiency. This paper presents a cube-enabled cloud geoprocessing engine that provides a fast and efficient way to conduct geospatial data processing. The engine is equipped with the capability to provide cloud storage and processing resources to meet the demands for large-scale geospatial data processing. This engine not only incorporates a number of cloud-native geospatial operators based on Apache Spark but also integrates existing operators from open-source Geographic Information System (GIS) software, thus delivering an extensive array of computational methodologies. In addition, it offers two modes for geoprocessing: on-the-fly and batch, which improve the user experience in performing large-scale geoprocessing.", "venue": "International Conference on Agro-Geoinformatics", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-07-25", "journal": {"name": "2023 11th International Conference on Agro-Geoinformatics (Agro-Geoinformatics)", "pages": "1-6"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "144207288", "name": "R.
