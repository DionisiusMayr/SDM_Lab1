Distance-based Join Queries (DJQs), like nearest neighbor join (kNNJQ) or closest pairs queries (kCPQ), are not supported by it. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate how to design and implement efficient DJQ distributed algorithms in Apache Sedona, using the most appropriate spatial partitioning and other optimization techniques. The results of an extensive set of experiments with real-world datasets are presented, demonstrating that the proposed kNNJQ and kCPQ distributed algorithms are efficient, scalable, and robust in Apache Sedona. Finally, Sedona is also compared to other similar cluster computing systems, showing the best performance for kCPQ and competitive results for kNNJQ.", "venue": "International Journal of General Systems", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-02-19", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of General Systems", "pages": "206 - 250", "volume": "52"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1410620391", "name": "Francisco Garc\u00eda-Garc\u00eda"}, {"authorId": "145747811", "name": "Antonio Corral"}, {"authorId": "1807223", "name": "L.
