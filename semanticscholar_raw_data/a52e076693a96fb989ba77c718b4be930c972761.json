In essence, the block-chain is a shared database. In recent years, block-chain technology has attracted the attention of the public and society. This paper mainly conducts systematic research and analysis on the integration and optimization of big data in sports training by block-chain, and achieves large-scale consensus in the case of decentralization, therefore, the information of the network will not be tampered with and forged, thus crossing the boundary of the bottom layer of the information system. This paper is based on the integration and optimization of sports training is big data. With the help of block-chain technology, each module is designed and implemented according to the needs. At the same time, the pow algorithm inside the block-chain is improved. The research results show that it is based on the block-chain. The integration and optimization of technical sports training big data can reduce the number of sports training injuries of sports school students by 10% -20%, which is very conducive to the healthy growth and development of sports school students.", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2021-06-04", "journal": {"name": "Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems", "pages": "1-7", "volume": ""}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2144376638", "name": "Zhichen Yang"}, {"authorId": "2143713757", "name": "Xinxin Zheng"}], "citations": []}
