IoT network is growing rapidly in every field such as healthcare, military, agriculture, traffic management, and education, etc. In the next era, maximum communication will be through IoT. The IoT applications are increasing comfort, automated work, and efficiency for the users. These networks are in the form of wireless, wired, and ad-hoc networks. The main goal of IoT is to provide interconnectivity seamlessly by connecting anybody to anything, anywhere at any place by any network. Protocols play a major role in interconnectivity, heterogeneity, handling dynamic changes, security, and management of the number of devices connecting to IoT. This paper presents the architecture of IoT and services provided by different protocols.", "venue": "2020 International Conference on Decision Aid Sciences and Application (DASA)", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2020-11-08", "journal": {"name": "2020 International Conference on Decision Aid Sciences and Application (DASA)", "pages": "1027-1031"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2047071934", "name": "Navdeep Lata"}, {"authorId": "2157593272", "name": "Raman Kumar"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "e4cdf86901d8a26307dc0ff8ceef1d6a5e414077", "title": "Edge Caching for Mobile Devices"}]}
