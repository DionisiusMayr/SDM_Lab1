In this paper, we describe the relationship between machine learning and compiler optimization and introduce the main concepts of features, models, training, and deployment. We then provide a comprehensive survey and provide a road map for the wide variety of different research areas. We conclude with a discussion on open issues in the area and potential research directions. This paper provides both an accessible introduction to the fast moving area of machine-learning-based compilation and a detailed bibliography of its main achievements.", "venue": "Proceedings of the IEEE", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2018-05-10", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the IEEE", "pages": "1879-1901", "volume": "106"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2248210935", "name": "Zheng Wang"}, {"authorId": "2241521853", "name": "Michael F.
