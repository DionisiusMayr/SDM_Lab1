Based on this problem and considering that common algorithms do not offer an optimal solution in this situation, it is necessary to resort to artificial intelligence techniques because they offer methods and algorithms that reduce the time and resources needed to generate an optimal program. This document details different artificial intelligence techniques used for the allocation of schedules, in order to find the technique that best suits the needs of the institution under study Universidad Francisco de Paula Santander, Oca\u00f1a located in Colombia, and which will be implemented more forward as a possible solution for the allocation of academic schedules in the institution.", "venue": "Journal of Physics: Conference Series", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Physics"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2019-11-01", "journal": {"name": "Journal of Physics: Conference Series", "volume": "1403"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2288709236", "name": "A M Velasquez"}, {"authorId": "1414545103", "name": "T.
