The deployment of the service function chain (SFC) is a key technology that affects the performance of virtual network function (VNF). The key issue in the deployment of SFCs is proposing effective algorithms to achieve efficient use of resources. In this article, we propose an SFC deployment optimization (SFCDO) algorithm based on a breadth-first search (BFS). The algorithm first uses a BFS-based algorithm to find the shortest path between the source node and the destination node. Then, based on the shortest path, the path with the fewest hops is preferentially chosen to implement the SFC deployment. Finally, we compare the performances with the greedy and simulated annealing (G-SA) algorithm. The experiment results show that the proposed algorithm is optimized in terms of end-to-end delay and bandwidth resource consumption. In addition, we also consider the load rate of the nodes to achieve network load balancing.", "venue": "IEEE Internet of Things Journal", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-07-01", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Internet of Things Journal", "pages": "5760-5772", "volume": "7"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "143847421", "name": "Gang Sun"}, {"authorId": "2109070863", "name": "Zhu Xu"}, {"authorId": "49514984", "name": "Hongfang Yu"}, {"authorId": "2145307270", "name": "Xi Chen"}, {"authorId": "2000026046", "name": "Victor I.
