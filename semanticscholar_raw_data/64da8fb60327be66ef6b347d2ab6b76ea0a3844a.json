We apply these methods to data samples with up to 60% missingness, this way doubling the number of instances with complete values in the resulting dataset. The imputation models performance is assessed with Wilcoxon\u2019s test for statistical significance and Cohen\u2019s effect size metrics. To solve the classification task, we employ three intelligent approaches: Neural Networks (NN); Support Vector Machines (SVM); and Random Forests (RF). Subsequently, we critically analyse which imputation method influences most the classifiers\u2019 performance, using a multiclass classification accuracy metric, based on the area under the ROC curves. We consider two superclasses (\u2018military\u2019 and \u2018civil\u2019), each containing several \u2018subclasses\u2019, and introduce and propose two new metrics: inner class accuracy (IA); and outer class accuracy (OA), in addition to the overall classification accuracy (OCA) metric. We conclude that they can be used as complementary to the OCA when choosing the best classifier for the problem at hand.", "venue": "Journal of Artificial Intelligence and Soft Computing Research", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "Journal of Artificial Intelligence and Soft Computing Research", "pages": "31 - 48", "volume": "8"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3122285", "name": "I.
