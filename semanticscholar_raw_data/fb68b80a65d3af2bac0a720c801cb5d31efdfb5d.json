Elastic resource allocation allows us to allocate and release VMs as computing demand changes while satisfying Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements. In this thesis, we explore QoS-aware elastic resource allocation for three different data processing models: batch, micro-batch, and streaming. First, we present two frameworks for elastic batch data processing. The first elastic batch data processing framework supports autonomous VM scaling using application-level migration. It does not require any prior knowledge about the target application, but dynamically reconfigures the application to keep the CPU utilization within a certain range. The second framework uses Workload-tailored Elastic Compute Units as a measure of computing resources analogous to Amazon EC2\u2019s ECUs. Given a deadline, our framework finds the cost-optimal resource configuration of heterogeneous VMs to satisfy the required throughput. Next, we propose an elastic micro-batch data processing framework for continuous air traffic optimization. Air traffic optimization is commonly formulated as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem. For continuous optimization, we periodically solve ILP problems with regular intervals, where each problem is a micro-batch data processing job. Since the fluctuating number of flights creates dynamically changing computational demand, our framework predicts future workload and proactively schedules VMs to solve the ILP problems in a timely manner. Finally, we propose a framework for sustainable elastic stream processing based on the concept of Maximum Sustainable Throughput (MST). It is the maximum processing throughput a streaming application can process indefinitely for a number of VMs. Stream processing is sustainable if the system\u2019s MST is always greater than the input data rates of incoming workload.
