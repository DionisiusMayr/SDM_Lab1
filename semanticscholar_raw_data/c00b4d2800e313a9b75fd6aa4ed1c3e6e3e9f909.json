Since manually configuring is both time\u2010consuming and cost\u2010intensive, automatically tuning configurations parameters to achieve a better performance has been an urgent need. Besides, considering various graph management requirements, GDBs begin to utilize the modular architecture to interoperate with a wide range of storage and index backends. Due to the complicated interactions among different modules, sequentially tuning each software with previous solutions may fall into a local optimal and it is necessary to jointly autotune the cross\u2010module configuration parameters. Toward this challenging target, we propose JointConf\u2014a new black\u2010box approach of jointly autotuning configuration parameters for modularized GDBs. To address the formulated high\u2010dimensional black\u2010box optimization problem, JointConf utilizes the recently proposed BO_dropout algorithm. Inspired by the dropout algorithm in neural networks, BO_dropout explores efficient dimension dropout to achieve a high\u2010dimensional Bayesian optimization. We evaluate the effectiveness of JointConf on a local distributed JanusGraph cluster with three different graph query benchmark applications and experimental results show its advantages over the four baseline search\u2010based approaches. The necessity of jointly tuning for modularized GDBs is also verified in our experiments.", "venue": "J. Softw. Evol.
