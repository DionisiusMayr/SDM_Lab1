The paper presents a comparative performance analysis of two different chaos data transmission systems: frequency-modulated chaos shift keying (FM-CSK) and quadrature chaos phase-shift keying (QCPSK), and a comparison to their non-chaotic counterparts: frequency-shift keying (FSK) and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). For both chaotic communication systems, the Vilnius oscillator and substitution method of chaotic synchronization are chosen due to simple circuitry implementation and low power consumption properties. The performance of the systems in the fading channel with additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) is evaluated. Also, the systems\u2019 performance in the case phase noise is investigated, and the benefits of chaotic waveforms employment for data transmission are demonstrated.", "venue": "Electronics", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2023-01-31", "journal": {"name": "Electronics"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1491622264", "name": "Ruslans Babajans"}, {"authorId": "1491623191", "name": "Darja Cirjulina"}, {"authorId": "1410823712", "name": "F.
