However, establishing such a connection requires a fault-tolerant routing scheme. The existing routing scheme results in communication but does not address various problems directly linked with energy consumption. Cross layer-based scheme and optimization schemes are frequently used scheme for improving the energy efficiency performance in IoT. Therefore, this paper investigates the approaches where cross-layer-based schemes are used to retain energy efficiencies among resource-constrained devices. The paper discusses the effectivity of the approaches used to optimize network performance in IoT applications. The study outcome of this paper showcase that there are various open-end issues, which is required to be addressed effectively in order to improve the performance of application associated with the IoT system.", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2021-08-01", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering", "pages": "2925-2933", "volume": "11"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "143657863", "name": "S.
