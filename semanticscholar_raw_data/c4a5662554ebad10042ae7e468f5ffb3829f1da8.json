On-board data specialists use computer-aided methods to interpret these data and to provide pertinent information for decision makers. Immersive Analytics can help specialists to explore the data more efficiently, however current interaction techniques limit both exploration and adoption. This work discusses current research goals on interaction methodologies for mixed reality immersive visualization for collaborative work. We have created a simple prototype that allows users to collaborate in an immersive environment using multiple HoloLens and a projection mapped tabletop display. In its current form, users can join the augmented reality session (with position and orientation tracking) and visually explore the data.", "venue": "", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "145715930", "name": "Juliano Franz"}, {"authorId": "145462410", "name": "Joseph W.
