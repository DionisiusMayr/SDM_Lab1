We expect that consumers have high expectations when perceiving the genuine intent of CSR \u2013 their perceptions are formed by what the firm signals it will do through certain types of CSR activities and how much it will benefit from them. When these genuine intentions are found to be false, or disconfirmed, firms will be worse off than if they had not signalled \u2018genuine\u2019 intent to begin with. Our results suggest that the expected CSR payoffs moderate the moderation of the indirect effect of CSR fraud perceptions on the purchase intention through ethical CSR beliefs by the CSR activity types, especially when the CSR actions are dominated by social activities with low expected firm benefits.", "venue": "Journal of Marketing Management", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-11-10", "journal": {"name": "Journal of Marketing Management", "pages": "615 - 647", "volume": "39"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "47033307", "name": "L.
