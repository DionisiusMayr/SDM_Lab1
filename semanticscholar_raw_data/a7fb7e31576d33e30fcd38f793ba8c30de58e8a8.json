While such expressing power contributes to their popularity in real-world applications, it presents a significant challenge for systems supporting tree-structured data. Existing systems have focused on general-purpose solutions either extending RDBMSs or designing native systems. However, the general-purpose approach often results in sophisticated data structures and algorithms, which may not reflect and optimize for the actual structure patterns in the real world. In this paper, we aim to better understand tree-structured data types in real uses and optimize for the common patterns. We present an in-depth study of five types of real-world use cases of tree-structured data. We find that a majority of the root-to-leaf paths in the tree structures are simple, containing up to one repeated node. Given this insight, we design and implement Steed, a native analytical database system for tree-structured data. Steed implements the baseline general-purpose support for storing and querying data in both row and column layouts. Then we enhance the baseline design with a set of optimizations to simplify and improve the processing of simple paths. Experimental evaluation shows that our optimization improves the baseline by a factor of up to 1.74x. Compared to three representative state-of-the-art systems (i.e. PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Hive+Parquet), Steed achieves orders of magnitude better performance in both cold cache and hot cache scenarios.", "venue": "SIGMOD Conference", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2017-05-09", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 2017 ACM International Conference on Management of Data"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2109045479", "name": "Zhiyi Wang"}, {"authorId": "116038464", "name": "Shimin Chen"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "acb9cb50436c71180ca4d9857300f1f505438a63", "title": "QUEST: An Efficient Query Evaluation Scheme Towards Scan-Intensive Cross-Model Analysis"}, {"paperId": "9b2ac5781aed765696b2513e5be3da11c9e922b3", "title": "Schema-based Column Reordering for Dremel-encoded Data"}, {"paperId": "aaa510cce8bbfad0ea18e64d6e2e1e278b927554", "title": "Data Integration from Heterogeneous Control Levels for the Purposes of Analysis within Industry 4.0 Concept"}, {"paperId": "518e645e79d05be76b2259b423205e926d241ef3", "title": "Accelerating Columnar Storage Based on Asynchronous Skipping Strategy"}, {"paperId": "8b2565d9985008447748357f6ed330d786759dfd", "title": "Ameliorating data compression and query performance through cracked Parquet"}, {"paperId": "70304506acf1ded8442e31b8b501ec6c0c0db3c7", "title": "To Not Miss the Forest for the Trees - A Holistic Approach for Explaining Missing Answers over Nested Data"}, {"paperId": "22324ab842a3b64d26f1decd7ab34704f781e6f5", "title": "Discovering Closed and Maximal Embedded Patterns from Large Tree Data"}, {"paperId": "db2513ef61b1f96a7b4f922f3e9dd1cc543ea6a7", "title": "Distributed Tree-Pattern Matching in Big Data Analytics Systems"}, {"paperId": "90f4d52b94ff7b62e800c283bd292d59dfdd3ab3", "title": "Advances in Databases and Information Systems: 24th European Conference, ADBIS 2020, Lyon, France, August 25\u201327, 2020, Proceedings"}, {"paperId": "975e6571efc26501fd81375cb62051b2578b0fdd", "title": "CORES"}, {"paperId": "b996015188258eb695ca8d42e2135e9605fd3b35", "title": "An Improved Dynamic Vertical Partitioning Technique for Semi-Structured Data"}, {"paperId": "72840acc9dd93c69ee26f2e5217c908a4e107a55", "title": "From Homomorphisms to Embeddings: A Novel Approach for Mining Embedded Patterns from Large Tree Data"}, {"paperId": "add330e246b1f4886c94e73cd53e1e95cae9dee3", "title": "STEED: An Analytical Database System for TrEE-structured Data"}, {"paperId": "059c3805891ac1d1442cca6cc37a59ee9864e0da", "title": "Tracing nested data with structural provenance for big data analytics"}]}
