Among them, healthcare is also broadly unified with the Internet of Things to develop an industrial forthcoming system. Utilizing this type of system can be facilitating optimum patient monitoring, competent diagnosis, intensive care, and including the appropriate operation against the existing critical diseases. Due to enormous data theft or privacy leakage, security, and privacy towards patient-based informative data, the preservation of personal patients\u2019 informative data has now become a necessity in the digitized community. The produced article is underlined on handsomely monitoring, perceptively extracted keyframe, and further processed lightweight cosine functions using hybrid way chaotic map keyframe image encryption. Initially, a regular concept of extracted keyframe is deployed to salvage meaningful detected frames by transmitting an alert autonomously to the administration. Then, lightweight cosine function for encryption is employed. This encryption incorporates keyframe exceedingly secure and safe from the outside world or any adversary. Our proposed methodology validates effectiveness throughout the IIoT ecosystem. The produced outcome is highly acceptable and has minimum execution time, robustness, and reasonably adopted cost-effective, secure parameter than any other (keyframes) image encryption methods. Furthermore, this methodology has optimally reduced bandwidth, essential communicating price, transmission cost, storage, and immediately judicious analysis of each occurred activity from the outside world or any adversary to remain secure and confident about the real patient-based data in the smartly developed environment.", "venue": "Scientific Programming", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-03-29", "journal": {"name": "Scientific Programming"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "50319941", "name": "Jalaluddin Khan"}, {"authorId": "68972452", "name": "G.
