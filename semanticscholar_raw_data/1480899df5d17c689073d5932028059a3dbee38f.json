Nowadays, Digital Twin is among the principal and emerging technological innovations of both Industry 4.0 and the emerging Industry 5.0, enabling an interaction between physical and virtual objects, Big Data, Internet of Things, and Artificial Intelligence. The construction sector, too, is now exploring the potentialities offered by the Digital Twin approach in enhancing innovative, responsible, and sustainable governance of buildings\u2019 lifecycles. Concerning these issues, this paper proposes visualizing future challenges with a specific focus on the operation and maintenance phase and its related impact on decarbonization via a critical literature review of the current statements. The applied methodology is based on three different questions related to certain research issues performed in the Scopus database. The selected findings were filtered, classified, and discussed. Some future challenges on specific issues have been identified, defining and promoting novel research ideas.", "venue": "Buildings", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2024-02-01", "journal": {"name": "Buildings"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2256871888", "name": "M.
