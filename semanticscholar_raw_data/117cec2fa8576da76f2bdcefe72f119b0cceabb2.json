Data mining is a computer-assisted process of massive data investigation that extracts meaningful information from the datasets. The mined information is used in decision-making to understand the behavior of each attribute. Therefore, a new classification algorithm is introduced in this paper to improve information management. The classical C4.5 decision tree approach is combined with the Selfish Herd Optimization (SHO) algorithm to tune the gain of given datasets. The optimal weights for the information gain will be updated based on SHO. Further, the dataset is partitioned into two classes based on quadratic entropy calculation and information gain. Decision tree gain optimization is the main aim of our proposed C4.5-SHO method. The robustness of the proposed method is evaluated on various datasets and compared with classifiers, such as ID3 and CART. The accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve parameters are estimated and compared with existing algorithms like ant colony optimization, particle swarm optimization and cuckoo search.", "venue": "PeerJ Computer Science", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science", "Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-04-07", "journal": {"name": "PeerJ Computer Science", "volume": "7"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2052872624", "name": "G.
