To schedule the network common resources, it is necessary to generate the initial population through the Hamming distance constraint and improve the objective function as the fitness function to complete the emergency scheduling of the network common resources. The traditional method, from the perspective of public resource fairness and priority mapping, uses incremental optimization algorithm to realize emergency scheduling of public resources, neglecting the improvement process of the objective function, which leads to unsatisfactory scheduling effect. An emergency scheduling method of cloud computing platform network public resources based on genetic algorithm is proposed. With emergency public resource scheduling time cost and transportation cost minimizing target, initial population by Hamming distance constraints, emergency scheduling model, and the corresponding objective function improvement as the fitness function, the genetic algorithm to individual selection and crossover and mutation probability were optimized and complete the public emergency resources scheduling. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively improve the efficiency of emergency resource scheduling, and the reliability of emergency scheduling is better.", "venue": "Complex", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-04-24", "journal": {"name": "Complex.", "pages": "9950198:1-9950198:11", "volume": "2021"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2115296719", "name": "Dingrong Liu"}, {"authorId": "2113322213", "name": "Zhigang Yao"}, {"authorId": "3126917", "name": "Liukui Chen"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "275c6d16cf3c325be13b9c56319588f3506c5ee8", "title": "Retracted: Emergency Scheduling Optimization Simulation of Cloud Computing Platform Network Public Resources"}, {"paperId": "62b04a25e0010b112c99cd532de575219871264b", "title": "Design and Application of Vague Set Theory and Adaptive Grid Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm in Resource Scheduling Optimization"}, {"paperId": "a24e7cd192d397cc8ae5dada9bfab1bcae7e1a4b", "title": "An Improved Bat Algorithm With Time-Varying Wavelet Perturbations for Cloud Computing Resources Scheduling"}, {"paperId": "bcfba9eb3004bfaf8b065e817526c1a53f6eba99", "title": "Optimization and Matching Scheme of Public Management Resources for Industry 4.0 and Smart City"}, {"paperId": "d1753077ba633100aa32039d18d6bec381e3354c", "title": "An Algorithm of Mobile Edge Computing O\ufffdoading Based on Improved SPEA2 Algorithm"}]}
