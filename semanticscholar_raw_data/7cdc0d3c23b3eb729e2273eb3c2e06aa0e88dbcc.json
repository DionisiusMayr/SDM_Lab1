Existing technologies have limitations in accurately identifying pedestrians. We propose SafeCross, a novel system that combines image recognition and thermal imaging technology based on the FLIR TrafiOne 156 sensor, which accurately detects elderly individuals at road intersections in low visibility or obstructed conditions and implement traffic light control based on the algorithm provided by SafeCross. Our findings demonstrate the potential of SafeCross system ensures safety for older adults at intersections, Making a significant contribution to reducing the accident rate among the elderly.", "venue": "Frontiers in Computing and Intelligent Systems", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-11-05", "journal": {"name": "Frontiers in Computing and Intelligent Systems"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2267786295", "name": "Leyan Yang"}], "citations": []}
