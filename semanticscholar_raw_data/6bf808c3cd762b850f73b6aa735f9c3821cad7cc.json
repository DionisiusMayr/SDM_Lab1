There are three open issues with distributed RDF data management systems that are not well addressed altogether in existing work. First is the querying efficiency, second, solutions are optimized for certain types of query patterns and don't necessarily work well for all types of query patterns, and the third is concerned with reducing pre-processing and data loading times. To address these issues, we propose a relational partitioning scheme called Subset Property Table (SPT) for RDF data that further partitions the existing Property Table approach into subsets of tables to minimize query input and join operation. We combine SPT with another existing model Vertical Partitioning (VP) for storing RDF datasets and demonstrate that our proposed combined (SPT + VP) approach outperforms state-of-the-art systems based on in-memory processing engine in a distributed environment.", "venue": "International Computer Science Conference", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2019-03-11", "journal": {"name": "2019 IEEE 13th International Conference on Semantic Computing (ICSC)", "pages": "24-31"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2042697689", "name": "Mahmudul Hassan"}, {"authorId": "1720381", "name": "S.
