We first briefly reviewed the emergence definition of big data. Next, we introduced the methodology of literature collection and presented results of bibliometric analysis. Then, we identified types of big data used and the application of artificial intelligence in big data usage in hospitality and tourism research, followed by unveiling major themes of big data and artificial intelligence research in extant literature such as forecasting, industry development, marketing, performance analysis, consumer behaviors, attitudes, and so on. In addition, implications and challenges of applying big data and artificial intelligence in hospitality and tourism research and new directions for future research are identified. Finally, we discuss limitations of our review, proposing future research directions for scholars.", "venue": "Journal of Hospitality Marketing & Management", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2021-07-06", "journal": {"name": "Journal of Hospitality Marketing & Management", "pages": "145 - 175", "volume": "31"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2064713364", "name": "Hui Lv"}, {"authorId": "2147207947", "name": "Si Shi"}, {"authorId": "97920175", "name": "D.
