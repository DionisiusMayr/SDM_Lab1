As the standard TCP congestion control mechanism and its variants are designed for achieving \u201cfairness\u201d among competing flows and are agnostic to the application layer contexts, the bandwidth allocation among a set of TCP flows traversing bottleneck links often leads to sub-optimal application-layer performance measures, e.g., stream processing throughput or average tuple complete latency. Motivated by this and enabled by the rapid development of the software-defined networking (SDN) techniques, in this paper, we re-investigate the design space of the bandwidth allocation problem and propose a cross-layer framework which utilizes the instantaneous information obtained from the application layer and provides on-the-fly and dynamic bandwidth adjustment algorithms for assisting the stream analytics applications achieving better performance during the runtime. We implement a prototype cross-layer bandwidth allocation framework based on a popular open-source distributed stream processing platform, Apache Storm, together with the OpenDaylight controller, and carry out extensive experiments with real-world analytical workloads on top of a local cluster consisting of ten workstations interconnected by a SDN-enabled fat-tree like testbed. The experiment results clearly validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed framework and algorithms. Finally, we leverage the proposed cross-layer SDN framework and introduce an exemplary mechanism for bandwidth sharing and performance reasoning among multiple active applications and show a case of a point solution on how to approximate application-level fairness.", "venue": "IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2019-07-05", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications", "pages": "1688-1702", "volume": "37"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1691813", "name": "Walid A.
