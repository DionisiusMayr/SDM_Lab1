The preliminary results show that the LAMA-2-7b is the best in all dimensions. Despite these results, the new Mistral-7b, which is supposedly more capable, may still be in the data collection stage, needing larger datasets to shine This article learns more about their capabilities and how important they are to give testing examples continue to illuminate.", "venue": "2023 International Conference on Emerging Research in Computational Science (ICERCS)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-12-07", "journal": {"name": "2023 International Conference on Emerging Research in Computational Science (ICERCS)", "pages": "1-6"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2284888029", "name": "Hiren Thakkar"}, {"authorId": "2284885914", "name": "A.
