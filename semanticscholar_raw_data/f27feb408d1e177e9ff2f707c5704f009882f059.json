The knowledge increased from Big Data adds value through Big Data Analytics (BDA). Essential part of BDA is Cost minimization and it can be attained by monitoring the system performance in the cloud. As the established methods of data management not properly supported by the cloud. For these reasons it was needed to look for some methodology to obtain solution and to optimize the performance. Therefore there is a need to develop Performance Optimization algorithms for the NoSQL database under consideration. The main objective of proposed study is to improve performance of unstructured data stored in the cloud environment using some methodologies tools.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2020-08-29", "journal": {"name": "Paripex Indian Journal Of Research", "volume": "9"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "47050462", "name": "Rupal Parekh"}, {"authorId": "82118958", "name": "A.
