One typical advantage of DT is that it can be used to not only virtually replicate a system\u2019s detailed operations but also analyze the current condition, predict the future behavior, and re\ufb01ne the control optimization. Although DT has been widely implemented in various \ufb01elds, such as smart manufacturing and transportation, its conventional paradigm is limited to embody non-living entities, e.g., robots and vehicles. When adopted in human-centric systems, a novel concept, called human digital twin (HDT) has thus been proposed. Particularly, HDT allows in silico representation of individual human body with the ability to dynamically re\ufb02ect molecular status, physiological status, emotional and psychological status, as well as lifestyle evolutions. These prompt the expected application of HDT in personalized healthcare, which can facilitate the remote monitoring, diagnosis, prescription, surgery and rehabilitation, and hence signi\ufb01cantly alleviate the heavy burden on the traditional healthcare system. However, despite the large potential, HDT faces substantial research challenges in different aspects, and becomes an increasingly popular topic recently. In this survey, with a speci\ufb01c focus on the networking perspective, we \ufb01rst discuss the differences between HDT and the conventional DT, followed by the architecture and design requirements of HDT. We then review and analyze end-to-end networking technologies for enabling HDT, including data acquisition, communication, computation, data management, data analysis and decision making. We conclude the paper by presenting the future research directions of HDT.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2301.03930"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2108327012", "name": "Jiayuan Chen"}, {"authorId": "2615388", "name": "Changyan Yi"}, {"authorId": "9768908", "name": "S.
