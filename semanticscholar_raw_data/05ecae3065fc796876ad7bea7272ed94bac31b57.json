As a case study has been chosen a grid power infrastructure to examine data synchronization impact on the data storage quality during NIS Plan and the mobile solution Plan interaction. Three different interaction scenarios have been considered and optimal solutions were proposed in accordance with business priorities.", "venue": "2021 IEEE 9th Workshop on Advances in Information, Electronic and Electrical Engineering (AIEEE)", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2021-11-25", "journal": {"name": "2021 IEEE 9th Workshop on Advances in Information, Electronic and Electrical Engineering (AIEEE)", "pages": "1-5"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2149929003", "name": "Diana Gauce"}, {"authorId": "49710980", "name": "A.
