In this survey, the status quo of the metaverse is investigated, and the technical framework of the metaverse is introduced from three aspects: 1) the generation of virtual worlds; 2) the connection of virtual and real objects; and 3) the transmission of data. Specifically, this survey first discusses the development and challenges of the related technologies for virtual world generation methods from three aspects: 1) the 3-D world generation; 2) immersive human\u2013computer interaction experience; and 3) ecosystem. Second, we investigate the status quo of extended reality (XR), motion capture, and brain\u2013computer interface technologies and evaluate the potential and research directions of these entrance technologies for the metaverse. Finally, network and data transmission technologies for the metaverse are reviewed from the Internet of Things (IoT), 5G/6G wireless, and edge computing aspects, the demand side of the metaverse in virtual-reality interpromotion, big data processing, and low-latency networking is discussed, and promising research hotspots are identified.", "venue": "IEEE Internet of Things Journal", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-09-15", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Internet of Things Journal", "pages": "15788-15809", "volume": "10"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2152704660", "name": "Dapeng Wu"}, {"authorId": "12317768", "name": "Zhigang Yang"}, {"authorId": "3148714", "name": "Puning Zhang"}, {"authorId": "102696136", "name": "Ruyang Wang"}, {"authorId": "3461555", "name": "Boran Yang"}, {"authorId": "2115763692", "name": "Xinqiang Ma"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "bdd50f0c14bf7c6849b3e854a38f952d205013d4", "title": "eXtended meta-uni-omni-Verse (XV): Introduction, Taxonomy, and State-of-the-Art"}, {"paperId": "331cb59ad51d0a5317d4278822072dad93d6732f", "title": "Forging the Industrial Metaverse - Where Industry 5.0, Augmented and Mixed Reality, IIoT, Opportunistic Edge Computing and Digital Twins Meet"}, {"paperId": "8bfe3086256c011e3f2872a40b71016482bf0db7", "title": "User Connection and Resource Allocation Optimization in Blockchain Empowered Metaverse over 6G Wireless Communications"}, {"paperId": "9fdb87c7a1cf50c602a405b15ee05a1085012160", "title": "Exploring Virtual Reality through Ihde's Instrumental Realism"}, {"paperId": "7f8deb0d9b3deffbae2f5ec6dae5618475559079", "title": "Beyond Reality: A Synthesis Analysis of Metaverse-Based Immersive Learning Experience"}, {"paperId": "48190c6a7504003cf03d72c08d428755539e8974", "title": "Artificial Intelligence Based Enhanced Virtual Mouse Hand Gesture Tracking Using Yolo Algorithm"}, {"paperId": "50cb5fea02911be9be48fbec8b84f079dfa8137b", "title": "RayBench: An Advanced NVIDIA-Centric GPU Rendering Benchmark Suite for Optimal Performance Analysis"}, {"paperId": "ec6a743f22664f02ab732bc0feae7a4c2b8d9f07", "title": "Integration of IoT and blockchain for decentralized management and ownership in the metaverse"}, {"paperId": "a252070f47e8bd9a6ffa89b3b61693e5dcb98ac3", "title": "De-contextual communication: Factors influencing usage intentions of metaverse technology in digital library services"}, {"paperId": "74bab0bfe8ce1590fcbc7a9bb9b1162084c86045", "title": "Enhancing Performance and Security in the Metaverse: Latency Reduction Using Trust and Reputation Management"}, {"paperId": "72241a055bf88c4d02e444340064ace089b97041", "title": "Enhancing supply chain resilience and realizing green sustainable development through the virtual environment of the metaverse"}, {"paperId": "dfae653a0f84af29d17ee8f342d31f0752b50b9f", "title": "Current security and privacy posture in wireless body area networks"}, {"paperId": "85ddcb60035e9dbb0c5c315f01ac6a4fd8d3eccb", "title": "Multiagent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Avatar Migration in AIoT-Enabled Vehicular Metaverses With Trajectory Prediction"}, {"paperId": "9d0cc12f17174b9a0228ec9ea23731d378a22061", "title": "YOLO-Based Semantic Communication With Generative AI-Aided Resource Allocation for Digital Twins Construction"}, {"paperId": "0547c16248fb5087a32d0b69cb8450b324102ad4", "title": "Neutrosophic CRITIC MCDM Methodology for Ranking Factors and Needs of Customers in Product's Target Demographic in Virtual Reality Metaverse"}, {"paperId": "7d936c9ed8f8d5ec478261687c34e3f1d5fbb1e8", "title": "Deep Learning Technique for Human Parsing: A Survey and Outlook"}, {"paperId": "873e7dd03a8ff19e35323468e82de7e6a6f787c1", "title": "Roles of Blockchain in the Metaverse: Concepts, Taxonomy, Recent Advances, Enabling Technologies, and Open Research Issues"}, {"paperId": "eae13cadb6a1fe6374a1b1d5a52bfb114aa94473", "title": "Harnessing the Metaverse for Livestock Welfare: Unleashing Sensor Data and Navigating Ethical Frontiers"}]}
