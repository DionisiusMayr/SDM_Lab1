Due to the nature of the WWW, long-term and continuous web scraping is a volatile and error-prone endeavor. The setup of a reliable extraction procedure comes along with various challenges. In this paper, a system design and implementation for a pipeline-oriented approach to web scraping is proposed. The main goal of the proposal is to establish a fault-tolerant execution of web scraping tasks with proper error handling strategies set in place. As errors are prevalent in web scraping, logging and error replication procedures are part of the processing pipeline. These mechanisms allow for effectively adapting web scraper implementations to evolving website targets. An implementation of the system was evaluated in a real-world case study, where thousands of web pages were scraped and processed on a daily basis. The results indicated that the system allows for effectively operating reliable and long-term web scraping endeavors.", "venue": "International Conference on Software and Data Technologies", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"pages": "441-448"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2057961178", "name": "Stefan Huber"}, {"authorId": "2176436036", "name": "Fabio Knoll"}, {"authorId": "2359786", "name": "M.
