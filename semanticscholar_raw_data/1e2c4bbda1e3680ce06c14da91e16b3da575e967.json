In response, data federation systems have emerged to perform secure queries across multiple data owners leveraging secure multi-party computation. However, existing systems are designed for relational data. They are highly inefficient on spatial queries and limited in usability. In this demonstration, we introduce Hu-Fu, the first data federation system for secure spatial queries with high efficiency and usability. Hu-Fu is designed from the perspectives of the query user and the data owner for high usability and decomposes a spatial query into as many plaintext operators and as few secure operators as possible for high efficiency. We demonstrate the deployment and usage of Hu-Fu via cross-company taxi-calling, a popular smart city application.", "venue": "Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-08-01", "journal": {"name": "Proc.
