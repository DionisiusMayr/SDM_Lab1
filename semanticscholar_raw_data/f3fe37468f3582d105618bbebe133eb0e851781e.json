Some of these traditional measures include business support, workspaces, laboratories, networking events, accommodation, and essential commodities. Besides, with rampantly changing multidisciplinary technologies and increased data-oriented business models, the classic science and technology park value-creation strategies may not be instrumental in the near future. Hence, we foresee that future science and a technology parks should be fully integrated, sustainable, and innovative living science cities. Where park tenants can actively interact and contribute to emerging technologies. Therefore, this paper carries out an in-depth study of world s best practices in smart cities and science and technology parks, their characteristics, and value-added contributions that excite the prospective tenants. Developing on the detailed survey, we propose a unique feature of Autonomous Systems as a Service to bestow a futuristic look to the science and technology parks. It is envisaged that autonomous systems will not only provide value-added services to the park tenants but will also provide an infrastructure for testing new technologies within park premises. Furthermore, this study evaluates security and privacy challenges associated with autonomous systems and data-oriented services and recommends appropriate security measures. The role of universities in the success of a science and technology park is also delineated. Finally, the components deemed essential for the attainment of science and technology parks objectives are highlighted.", "venue": "IEEE Access", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "IEEE Access", "pages": "31981-32021", "volume": "10"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "9233812", "name": "Imran Makhdoom"}, {"authorId": "143861150", "name": "J.
