This study aims to identify the effect of using big data technology in digital environments on the development of electronic social competence among optimal investment diploma students. An experimental method was used to explore the effect of big data technologies usage on social competence. The sample for this study consisted of (120) students in the Department of Curriculum and Teaching Methods, divided into two equal groups through random selection. The first group studied the course through a digital environment with the use of big data technology, while the second group studied the course through the digital environment without using big data technology. The electronic social competence scale was further utilized as a tool to meet the study\u2019s goal. The experimental findings showed that big data technologies in the used digital environment significantly improved the electronic social competence of Optimal Investment Diploma students (personal skills, self-management skills, and academic skills). The results provide significant proof of the advantages of big data technology in social competence studies and development.", "venue": "PeerJ Computer Science", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-11-17", "journal": {"name": "PeerJ Computer Science", "volume": "9"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "30774329", "name": "Abdellah Ibrahim Mohammed Elfeky"}, {"authorId": "2128859317", "name": "A.
