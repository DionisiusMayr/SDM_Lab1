This is the reason behind IoT currently expanding over a vast array of applications such as in the academic, healthcare, agricultural, military, industrial fields, etc. Storage, processor, network, sensor nodes, energy, and other IoT resource demands are varied in those applications. One apparent concern is the means of managing these constrained resources optimally. Lately, it has been strived hard to achieve an optimal resource management applying different scheduling approaches. In this research the various techniques utilized for IoT resource scheduling is presented. In addition, it is analyzed, and their strengths and weaknesses are compared. The survey also provides a study based on various metrics of IoT resource scheduling and besides this, various resource scheduling approaches are compared. At last, it is believed that much scope exists for the improvement of IoT resource management retaining the overall quality required. In this research, this kind of future direction of research in this domain is considered.", "venue": "2023 2nd International Conference on Edge Computing and Applications (ICECAA)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-07-19", "journal": {"name": "2023 2nd International Conference on Edge Computing and Applications (ICECAA)", "pages": "1288-1293"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "50004734", "name": "B.
