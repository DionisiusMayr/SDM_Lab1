This fascination extends particularly to the Internet of Things (IoT), a landscape characterized by the interconnection of countless devices, sensors, and systems, collectively gathering and sharing data to enable intelligent decision-making and automation. This research embarks on an exploration of the opportunities and challenges towards achieving AGI in the context of the IoT. Specifically, it starts by outlining the fundamental principles of IoT and the critical role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in IoT systems. Subsequently, it delves into AGI fundamentals, culminating in the formulation of a conceptual framework for AGI's seamless integration within IoT. The application spectrum for AGI-infused IoT is broad, encompassing domains ranging from smart grids, residential environments, manufacturing, and transportation to environmental monitoring, agriculture, healthcare, and education. However, adapting AGI to resource-constrained IoT settings necessitates dedicated research efforts. Furthermore, the paper addresses constraints imposed by limited computing resources, intricacies associated with large-scale IoT communication, as well as the critical concerns pertaining to security and privacy.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-09-14", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2309.07438"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2240538675", "name": "Fei Dou"}, {"authorId": "2241081066", "name": "Jin Ye"}, {"authorId": "2240529410", "name": "Geng Yuan"}, {"authorId": "2240766814", "name": "Qin Lu"}, {"authorId": "2260347943", "name": "Wei Niu"}, {"authorId": "2214271343", "name": "Haijian Sun"}, {"authorId": "2240557067", "name": "Le Guan"}, {"authorId": "2240532673", "name": "Guoyu Lu"}, {"authorId": "2240534117", "name": "Gengchen Mai"}, {"authorId": "2238404369", "name": "Ninghao Liu"}, {"authorId": "2240550872", "name": "Jin Lu"}, {"authorId": "2145977326", "name": "Zheng Liu"}, {"authorId": "47039788", "name": "Zihao Wu"}, {"authorId": "50979840", "name": "Chenjiao Tan"}, {"authorId": "2211904452", "name": "Shaochen Xu"}, {"authorId": "2214283393", "name": "Xianqiao Wang"}, {"authorId": "2258538330", "name": "Guoming Li"}, {"authorId": "2240528378", "name": "Lilong Chai"}, {"authorId": "2153703773", "name": "Sheng Li"}, {"authorId": "2214298401", "name": "Jin Sun"}, {"authorId": "2240853173", "name": "Hongyue Sun"}, {"authorId": "2240766399", "name": "Yunli Shao"}, {"authorId": "2166099489", "name": "Changying Li"}, {"authorId": "2115345993", "name": "Tianming Liu"}, {"authorId": "2107484804", "name": "Wenzhan Song"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "3d6197e4ab55a3a2785ce5934e48cfbe9fe9bf04", "title": "Revolutionizing Finance with LLMs: An Overview of Applications and Insights"}, {"paperId": "efc5e94635a850ede9c1f8dbce65d5dc536f3bfb", "title": "Understanding LLMs: A Comprehensive Overview from Training to Inference"}, {"paperId": "205ada2927972cb3156e94247e29d454bf620399", "title": "Towards Knowledge-driven Autonomous Driving"}, {"paperId": "36929b050d800ba8d250533a9a62765346cdcff6", "title": "Edge AI for Internet of Energy: Challenges and Perspectives"}, {"paperId": "0a898a2772c7c2941b83a737f1bef806710b047a", "title": "Evaluating multiple large language models in pediatric ophthalmology"}]}
