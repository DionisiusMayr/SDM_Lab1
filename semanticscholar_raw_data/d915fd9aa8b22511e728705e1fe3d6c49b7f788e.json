Although the modern emerging distributed internet is faster and more rapid than the traditional information media methods, its accuracy is subject to a greater impact. In this paper, we collect the information of text-video web pages through a crawler program, and after filtering through artificial intelligence retrieval technology to obtain the Marxist globalization theory and extract key information points, and delete irrelevant information. Then K-means clustering algorithm is used to cluster the information collected in the distributed internet to obtain the multidimensional interpretation of Marxist\u2019s globalization theory. This method has been proved to be effective through a large number of experiments. The existing distributed internet has a large amount of data that can be used to train artificial intelligence and has good practical conditions. This method helps Marxists to make better use of information from multiple nodes. The theoretical perspectives of working people from various countries are constantly gathered and pushed forward while saving a lot of manpower, so that Marxism can be better adapted to the rapidly developing globalized society.", "venue": "Applied Mathematics and Nonlinear Sciences", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-06-02", "journal": {"name": "Applied Mathematics and Nonlinear Sciences", "volume": "0"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2156108949", "name": "Huan Yang"}], "citations": []}
