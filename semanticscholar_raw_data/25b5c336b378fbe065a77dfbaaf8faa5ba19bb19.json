The era of big data network represented mainly by the Internet of Things is limited by various factors such as various envi-ronments, volumes, and calculations. This paper proposes and studies a human motion detection system based on the intelligent computing of the Internet of Things, which can effectively detect the daily motion of the human body. In the era of the Internet of Things, this paper designs and develops a human motion detection system based on the Internet of Things technology and intelligent computing and explores the law of normal human motion. This paper also analyzes the design ideas and technical advantages of the human motion detection system from many aspects. This research is a human motion detection system designed and developed under the comprehensive use of Internet of Things technology and intelligent computing technology, which can effectively detect the actual situation of the human body in the state of motion. Experimental results show that the overall accuracy of the system for monitoring and recognizing human walking is 96.91%, and the overall accuracy of monitoring and recognizing human jogging is 97.18%. It monitors and recognizes human jogging with an overall accuracy rate of 97.96%. It has great practical significance.", "venue": "", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2108845234", "name": "Yufei Liu"}, {"authorId": "46586837", "name": "Lin Zhao"}], "citations": []}
