This survey presents an overview of state-of-the art recommender systems and machine learning techniques applied to analyze data. Different ML algorithms have been utilized in building these systems, including Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machines (SVM), K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), and others. Many of these algorithms have shown accuracy and broad adoption by employing learning methods to support educational practices and provide recommendations in the field of education. The core methodologies employed in recommender systems consist of a content-based approach, a collaborative approach, and a hybrid approach. The findings of this study indicate a growth in research on recommender systems in recent years. The paper offers an analysis of the approaches and trends utilized in recommender systems for data.", "venue": "International Conference on Developments in eSystems Engineering", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-12-18", "journal": {"name": "2023 16th International Conference on Developments in eSystems Engineering (DeSE)", "pages": "782-787"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2293253984", "name": "Ammar Abbood Mohammed"}, {"authorId": "2055328969", "name": "Murtadha M.
