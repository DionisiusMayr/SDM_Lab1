For the systematic review of the literature, representative articles on the subject indexed in the Web of Science and Scopus databases were selected using the PRISMA 2020 flow diagram. As a result of the systematic review of the literature, a significant number of articles on the subject of digitalization in the energy sector were found\u2014both over the entire period considered and especially in the last five years\u2014indicating the magnitude of the digitalization process in this field. The impacts of digitalization in the energy production, distribution, and consumption sectors materialized in the aspects of health, safety, and environmental improvement; process improvements; and cost reductions. The most important technologies used in the digitalization process include data mining and machine learning, smart grid/smart metering/smart home, Internet of Things, cybersecurity, and automation solutions (e.g., robotics, drones, and distribution automation).", "venue": "Energies", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-02-16", "journal": {"name": "Energies"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "98559323", "name": "C.
