Health research data platforms came to facilitate such studies as they allow multiple projects to share access to cohorts\u2019 non-identifiable health information. Some latest initiatives are also starting to include mobile-generated data in their research programmes. Although seemly beneficial, it is not yet clear how potential participants feel about contributing to the new platforms: there is a need to investigate potential factors related to the acceptance in this specific context. In this paper, previous works from related contexts were brought together and, along with a qualitative study, composed a participant-centred perspective of enablers and barriers for contribution. We found that there is an apparent misalignment between current implementations and participants\u2019 preferences, leading us to propose design guidelines for future developments which can make participation more ethical and engaging.", "venue": "Nordic Conference on Human-Computer Interaction", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Psychology"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book"], "publicationDate": "2020-10-25", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 11th Nordic Conference on Human-Computer Interaction: Shaping Experiences, Shaping Society"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "10799141", "name": "G.
