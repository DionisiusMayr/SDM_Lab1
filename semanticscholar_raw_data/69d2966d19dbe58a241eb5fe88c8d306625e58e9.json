Areas covered This review examines the efficacy and safety data from phase II clinical trials on biologics, performed in patients with moderate-to-severe CD. A PubMed database literature review was conducted for relevant articles published from 2017 to 2022. Ongoing clinical phase II trials were retrieved from ClinicalTrials.gov database or abstracts from major congresses. Future perspectives for the treatment of CD patients with these new molecules were also discussed. Expert opinion Among the most promising biologics are interleukin (IL)-23p19 inhibitors (guselkumab, mirikizumab, and brazikumab), IL-6 inhibitors, and anti-adhesion molecules (ontamalimab). Furthermore, multiple biologics with different mechanisms of action are in clinical development for moderate-to-severe CD including molecules with anti-fibrotic mechanism of action (anti-TL1A, anti-IL-36 receptor). In addition to efficacy, some of them provide reassuring safety profiles. Phase III trials need to confirm these results, especially on their long-term safety issues.", "venue": "Expert Opinion on Investigational Drugs", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-05-30", "journal": {"name": "Expert Opinion on Investigational Drugs", "pages": "495 - 507", "volume": "32"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "50247656", "name": "P.
