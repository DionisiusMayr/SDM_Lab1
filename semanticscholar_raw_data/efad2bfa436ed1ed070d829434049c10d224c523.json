Several literature reviews that summarize existing research on consumer behavior and the pandemic have recently emerged. Many of them have a regional or country-specific focus. Others emphasize certain factors under study at the beginning of the pandemic. This study, in contrast, separates the most salient topics found in literature in 2020 from those found in 2021 using a global Scopus database showing the evolution of the academic discourse on consumer behavior as the pandemic developed. Interestingly, some differences show consumers\u2019 evolution throughout the pandemic, seen through the eyes of researchers. Topic modeling highlights the main topics under study in both years. Results show the relevance of four major topics that differ from one year to another. Research on online consumption, however, remains equally important in both years. We propose a theoretical model of consumer behavior research that aims to help consumers understand themselves, managers address strategies accordingly, and policymakers regulate the major issues brought by the pandemic. \u00a9 2022, Universidad Nacional de Colombia.
