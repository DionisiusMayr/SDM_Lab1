This is finished by indexing the data, so that it tends to be searched without compromising the security of the data. Guaranteeing the cloud data security is a main issue for corporate cloud supporters, and at times for the confidential cloud clients. The multi-keyword searching empowers more unambiguous questioning, and the top-k encrypted retrieval guarantees that the most significant data is uncovered. This approach can be utilized in different spaces, for example, healthcare, finance or legal, where data privacy is an urgent viewpoint.", "venue": "International Journal For Multidisciplinary Research", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-08-17", "journal": {"name": "International Journal For Multidisciplinary Research"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2224400665", "name": "D. -"}, {"authorId": "2136028961", "name": "P. ."}], "citations": []}
