In this work, we review the BD role in the agriculture sector in responding to two main questions: 1) Which technique, frameworks and data types were adopted. 2) Identification of the existing gap associated with the data sources, modeling, and analysis techniques. Therefore, the contribution in this paper can be outlined in three main aspects. 1) Popular BD frameworks were briefed, and a thorough comparison was conducted between them. 2) The potential data sources were described and characterized. 3) A Conceptual framework for Egyptian agriculture practice based on BD analytics was introduced. 4) Challenges and extensive recommendations have been provided, which could guide future development.", "venue": "International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2109249973", "name": "Sayed Ahmed"}, {"authorId": "2042378137", "name": "Amira-Sabrin Mahmoud"}, {"authorId": "93170874", "name": "E.
