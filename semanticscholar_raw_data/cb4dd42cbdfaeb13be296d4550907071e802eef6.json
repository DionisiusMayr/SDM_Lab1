However, existing data collection methods fail to efficiently aggregate and store data at extremely high speed and scale. In this paper, we explore a new approach that leverages programmable switches to aggregate data and directly write data to the destination storage. Our proposed data collection system, ALT, uses programmable switches to control NVMe SSDs on remote hosts without the involvement of a remote CPU. To tolerate loss, ALT uses an elegant data structure to enable efficient data recovery when retrieving the collected data. We implement our system on a Tofino-based programmable switch for a prototype. Our evaluation shows that ALT can saturate SSD\u2019s peak performance without any CPU involvement.", "venue": "Asia-Pacific Workshop on Networking", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-07-01", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 6th Asia-Pacific Workshop on Networking"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2117942633", "name": "Ziyuan Liu"}, {"authorId": "39931593", "name": "Zhixiong Niu"}, {"authorId": "9370070", "name": "Ran Shu"}, {"authorId": "3407848", "name": "Wenxue Cheng"}, {"authorId": "2112624870", "name": "Peng Cheng"}, {"authorId": "2142901", "name": "Y.
