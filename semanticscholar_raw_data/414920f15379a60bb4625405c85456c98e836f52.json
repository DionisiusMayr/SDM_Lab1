Several methods for geovisualization have already been developed, but many of them are focused on a specific application or require learning a variety of tools and programming languages. It becomes even more difficult when users have to manage a large amount of data because state-of-the-art alternatives require the use of third-party pre-processing tools. We present a novel Domain-Specific Language (DSL), which focuses on large data geovisualizations. Through a compiler, we support automatic visualization generations and data pre-processing. The system takes advantage of multi-core parallelism to speed-up data pre-processing abstractly. Our experiments were designated to highlight the programming effort and performance of our DSL. The results have shown a considerable programming effort reduction and efficient parallelism support with respect to the sequential version.", "venue": "Annual International Computer Software and Applications Conference", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2017-07-01", "journal": {"name": "2017 IEEE 41st Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference (COMPSAC)", "pages": "298-304", "volume": "01"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2467326", "name": "Cleverson Ledur"}, {"authorId": "1895129", "name": "Dalvan Griebler"}, {"authorId": "2917224", "name": "I.
