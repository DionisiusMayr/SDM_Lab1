Now, around the world, massive amounts of data are being collected and analyzed for better patient diagnosis and treatment, improving public health systems and assisting government agencies in designing and implementing public health policies, instilling confidence in future generations who want to use better public health systems. This article provides an overview of the HL7 FHIR Architecture, including the workflow state, linkages, and various informatics approaches used in healthcare units. The article discusses future trends and directions in Health Informatics for successful application to provide public health safety. With the advancement of technology, healthcare units face new issues that must be addressed with appropriate adoption policies and standards.", "venue": "Frontiers in Public Health", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-04-29", "journal": {"name": "Frontiers in Public Health", "volume": "10"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2877927", "name": "M.
