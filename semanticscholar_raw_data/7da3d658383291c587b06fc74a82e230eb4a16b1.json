Following the hardware trends in reality, we advocate to treat cameras as the first-class computing and storage platform, and expose their services to third parties. To this end, the cameras should move from hard-coded to software-defined, from dumb data source to autonomous data processor, from isolated to orchestrated, and from one-shot to human-in-the-loop.", "venue": "IEEE pervasive computing", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-04-01", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Pervasive Computing", "pages": "9-17", "volume": "20"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2529558", "name": "Mengwei Xu"}, {"authorId": "3180228", "name": "Yunxin Liu"}, {"authorId": "2110773587", "name": "Xuanzhe Liu"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "177fb44f7e994eb1eb03c133d385ce1194a52867", "title": "Enabling Cross-Camera Collaboration for Video Analytics on Distributed Smart Cameras"}, {"paperId": "0b6adf35ed1eefa238a9f8983abecb25cf164e3f", "title": "Automated Deep Learning Model Partitioning for Heterogeneous Edge Devices"}, {"paperId": "4351cbbc055eb4b2e57a2721f51a7c520f27566a", "title": "Resource-efficient Pervasive Smart Camera Networks"}, {"paperId": "4294cc13c408418483224f776b844027a1baf9de", "title": "Towards Ubiquitous Learning: A First Measurement of On-Device Training Performance"}]}
