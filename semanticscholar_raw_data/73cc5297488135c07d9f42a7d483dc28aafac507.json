A data lake is a storage system in which the data are presented in their original format, making it difficult to conduct analytics or present aggregated data. To solve this issue, data marts are used, representing environments of stored data of highly specialized information, focused on the requests of employees of a certain department, the vector of an organization\u2019s work. This article presents a study of big data storage formats in the Apache Hadoop platform when used to build data marts.", "venue": "Applied Sciences", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2021-09-17", "journal": {"name": "Applied Sciences"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "35188328", "name": "V.
