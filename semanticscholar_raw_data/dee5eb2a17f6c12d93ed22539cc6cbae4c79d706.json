Thousands of datasets are being continuously published in Open Government Data Portals (OGDP) for public use, which makes them an attractive data repository for researchers to study data integration problem. One common application of data integration is join operation to expand a table with additional columns, for which many studies have been proposed in the literature. However, usefulness of end result after joining of potential table pairs is under-explored, especially considering heterogeneous nature of OGDPs. To this end, we analyze joinability of tables based on high value overlap in several, English-speaking OGDPs; Canada, Singapore, UK, and US. Our analysis reveals that mainly due to high value repetition and nonexistence of key columns, vast majority of the joinable table pairs are accidental, resulting in uninterpretable tables.", "venue": "VLDB Workshops", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "48476766", "name": "Arif Usta"}, {"authorId": "1783781", "name": "S.
