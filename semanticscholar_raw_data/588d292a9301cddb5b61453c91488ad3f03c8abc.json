First, we formally formulate the deployment problem under VNFs sharing. Secondly, given the NP-hard nature of the above problem, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm capable of making intelligent placement decisions while considering multiple conflicting costs. Costs of transmission, VNF instantiation or energy consumption, among others. Thanks to the intelligence of the RL algorithm, simulation results show that the performance of the proposed algorithm is within a 14% margin and similar to an optimal solution in terms of request provisioning cost and acceptance ratio, respectively. Moreover, the algorithm results in more than a 20% and a 70% improvement in terms of request deployment cost and time compared to a state-of-the-art algorithm, and up to more than a 40% improvement in terms of cost compared to an algorithm that greedily minimizes the transmission or VNF activation costs.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-09-01", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management", "pages": "3352-3370", "volume": "19"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3273192", "name": "Godfrey Kibalya"}, {"authorId": "1403820763", "name": "J.
