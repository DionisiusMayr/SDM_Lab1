Vedolizumab (VDZ) and ustekinumab (UST) therapies could be good alternatives in patient with anti-TNF failure; however, no head-to-head randomized comparison of these drugs as second- or third-line treatments has been made. Objectives: This study aimed to assess the treatment persistence and comparative effectiveness of UST and VDZ in patients with refractory Crohn\u2019s disease (CD). Design: In this nationwide retrospective study, patients with CD on UST or VDZ maintenance therapy were enrolled. Clinical data at baseline, after induction, and at week 52 were obtained. Methods: Clinical and biochemical activities as well as corticosteroid-free remission (SFR) rates were assessed, while concomitant medications, comorbidities, hospitalizations, and surgeries were recorded during the follow-up to detect any predictors. Results: A total of 161 UST- and 65 VDZ-treated patients completed the follow-up. No significant difference in clinical or biochemical remission rates was observed after induction between the two treatment groups; however, clinical remission rate at week 52 was higher in UST group. UST showed superior drug persistence than VDZ (86.5%, 57.9%, p\u2009<\u20090.0001). The drug type was predictive of clinical SFR at week 52 [p\u2009=\u20090.011, odds ratio (OR)\u2009=\u20092.39 with UST]. Drug failure rates were higher for VDZ than those for UST (PNR rates: 21.54% and 4.97%, respectively, p\u2009<\u20090.001, OR\u2009=\u20098.267, p\u2009=\u20090.001). LOR and escalations were more common during UST treatment (61.5% versus 36.9%, p\u2009<\u20090.001; 64.2% versus 23.1%, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Hospital and surgical admission rates did not differ significantly. Only one adverse event occurred with VDZ at week 20, which led to drug cessation. Conclusions: VDZ and UST were safe and effective for treating patients with CD in whom anti-TNF therapy failed. UST showed superior drug persistence than VDZ, but dose escalation was more frequent. Biologicals used in lower treatment lines resulted in better drug persistence.", "venue": "Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-01-01", "journal": {"name": "Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology", "volume": "15"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "147769907", "name": "P.
