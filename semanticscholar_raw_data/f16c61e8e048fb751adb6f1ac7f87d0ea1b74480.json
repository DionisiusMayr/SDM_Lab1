The digital images are subsequently delivered to cloud systems via a sink node, where they are interacted with by smart communication systems using physical devices. Visual sensors are becoming a more significant part of digital systems and can help us live in a more intelligent world. However, for IoT-based data analytics, optimizing communications overhead by balancing the usage of energy and bandwidth resources is a new research challenge. Furthermore, protecting the IoT network\u2019s data from anonymous attackers is critical. As a result, utilizing machine learning, this study proposes a mobile edge computing model with a secured cloud (MEC-Seccloud) for a sustainable Internet of Health Things (IoHT), providing real-time quality of service (QoS) for big data analytics while maintaining the integrity of green technologies. We investigate a reinforcement learning optimization technique to enable sensor interaction by examining metaheuristic methods and optimally transferring health-related information with the interaction of mobile edges. Furthermore, two-phase encryptions are used to guarantee data concealment and to provide secured wireless connectivity with cloud networks. The proposed model has shown considerable performance for various network metrics compared with earlier studies.", "venue": "Sustainability", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-09-26", "journal": {"name": "Sustainability"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "39830875", "name": "A.
