However, current PR tools heavily rely on the developer to manually conduct PR module definition, floorplanning, and flow control at a low level. The existing PR tools do not consider High-Level-Synthesis languages either, which are of great interest to software developers. We propose HiPR, an open-source framework, to bridge the gap between HLS and PR. HiPR allows the developer to define partially reconfigurable C/C++ functions, instead of Verilog modules, to accelerate the FPGA incremental compilation and automate the flow from C/C++ to bitstreams. We use a lightweight Simulated Annealing floorplanner and show that it can produce high-quality PR floorplans an order of magnitude faster than analytic methods. By mapping Rosetta HLS benchmarks, we demonstrate that the incremental compilation can be accelerated by 3\u201310 \u00d7 compared with state-of-the-art Xilinx Vitis flow without performance loss, at the cost of 15-67% one-time overlay set-up time.", "venue": "ACM Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-09-14", "journal": {"name": "ACM Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2122426689", "name": "Yuanlong Xiao"}, {"authorId": "80086627", "name": "Dongjoon Park"}, {"authorId": "2239211570", "name": "Zeyu Jason Niu"}, {"authorId": "2239205993", "name": "Aditya Hota"}, {"authorId": "2239205073", "name": "Andr\u00e9 DeHon"}], "citations": []}
