Despite numerous diagnostic models, challenges persist in network configuration and performance degradation, impacting model accuracy. In response, this paper introduces the Optimally Configured and Improved Long Short-Term Memory (OCI-LSTM) model as a robust solution. Leveraging the Salp Swarm Algorithm, irrelevant features are systematically eliminated, and the Genetic Algorithm is employed to optimize the LSTM\u2019s network configuration. Validation metrics, including the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score, affirm the model\u2019s efficacy. Comparative analysis with a Deep Neural Network and Deep Belief Network establishes the OCI-LSTM\u2019s superiority, showcasing a notable accuracy increase of 97.11%. These advancements position the OCI-LSTM as a promising model for accurate and efficient early diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. Future research could explore real-world implementation and further refinement for seamless integration into clinical practice.", "venue": "Diagnostics", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-01-23", "journal": {"name": "Diagnostics", "volume": "14"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2281227879", "name": "Revathi T.K"}, {"authorId": "153294015", "name": "Sathiyabhama Balasubramaniam"}, {"authorId": "2281227933", "name": "Vidhushavarshini Sureshkumar"}, {"authorId": "2182489339", "name": "Seshathiri Dhanasekaran"}], "citations": []}
