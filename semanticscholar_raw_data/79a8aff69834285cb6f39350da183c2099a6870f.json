The students in this course built their own SQL-on-Hadoop engine as a term project in just 8 weeks. miniHive is written in Python and compiles SQL queries into MapReduce workflows. These are then executed on Hadoop. miniHive performs generic query optimizations (selection and projection pushdown, or cost-based join reordering), as well as Map- Reduce-specific optimizations.\n The course was taught in English, using a flipped classroom model. The course material was mainly compiled from third-party teaching videos. This report describes the course setup, the miniHive milestones, and gives a short review of the most successful student projects.", "venue": "SGMD", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2019-12-19", "journal": {"name": "SIGMOD Rec.", "pages": "33-38", "volume": "48"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1703312", "name": "Stefanie Scherzinger"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "b4908535dca10f7702a85c74f8a84eea9d15ed31", "title": "Toolunterst\u00fctzung f\u00fcr den \u00dcbungsbetrieb in der Datenbanklehre: Erfahrungen mit der Software Praktomat"}, {"paperId": "edb541d2014d0b4cdfd997f73cf0a2ad224ec6b0", "title": "Have your Students build their own Mini Hive in just Eight Weeks"}]}
