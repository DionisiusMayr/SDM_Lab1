Attracted by the exceptional computing and memory throughput capabilities, this work introduces ezLDA which achieves efficient and scalable LDA training on GPUs with the following three contributions: First, ezLDA introduces three-branch sampling method which takes advantage of the convergence heterogeneity of various tokens to reduce the redundant sampling task. Second, to enable sparsity-aware format for both D and W on GPUs with fast sampling and updating, we introduce hybrid format for W along with corresponding token partition to T and inverted index designs. Third, we design a hierarchical workload balancing solution to address the extremely skewed workload imbalance problem on GPU and scale ezLDA across multiple GPUs. Taken together, ezLDA achieves superior performance over the state-of-the-art attempts with lower memory consumption.", "venue": "IEEE Access", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-07-17", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Access", "pages": "100165-100179", "volume": "11"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2108554878", "name": "Shilong Wang"}, {"authorId": "1390915579", "name": "Hang Liu"}, {"authorId": "66024826", "name": "Anil Gaihre"}, {"authorId": "1708043", "name": "Hengyong Yu"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "d68beb54431476edf2fa90f621887baa31591826", "title": "Dr. Top-k: Delegate-Centric Top-k on GPUs"}]}
