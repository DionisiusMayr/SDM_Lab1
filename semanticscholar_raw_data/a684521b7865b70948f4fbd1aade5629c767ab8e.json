Spark is a type of in\u2010memory processing fitted iteration and interactive data mining tool. This tool possesses higher data\u2010processing performance than MapReduce, which is an offline storage mechanism. However, some disadvantages of in\u2010memory processing, such as massive in\u2010memory data requirements, cause cross\u2010node data transfer that result in a long computation time. The performance of the process can be improved if the in\u2010memory process is executed with fewer shuffle instructions. Therefore, this study aims to enhance the performance of iterative application through instruction replacement. Three empirical research cases with diverse datasets and iterations are used to modify the program. We adopt a strategy of downloading a small resilient distributed dataset and replacing the shuffle\u2010included instructions to shorten the processing time with an automated code replacement by using exhaustively code matching. The experimental results reveal an improvement of up to 39% in the execution time compared with the existing in\u2010memory processing programs with various dataset sizes.", "venue": "Concurrency and Computation", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2019-12-09", "journal": {"name": "Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience", "volume": "32"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2408634", "name": "Yean-Fu Wen"}, {"authorId": "2135840063", "name": "Yu-Fang Chen"}, {"authorId": "1564379178", "name": "Tse Kai Chiu"}, {"authorId": "2118388694", "name": "Yen-Chou Chen"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "857cea3f7d26b142d77b199cf0747612bdfb4067", "title": "Data privacy mechanisms development and performance evaluation for personal and ubiquitous blockchain-based storage"}, {"paperId": "730970e348067fbd096e438f72bae81906b8938c", "title": "Research on Array Circuit Design Based on In-Memory Computing"}]}
