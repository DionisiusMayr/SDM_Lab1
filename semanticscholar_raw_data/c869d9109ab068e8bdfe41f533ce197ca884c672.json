They have properties that di erentiate them from other types of data, such as a complex structure and dynamism. In recent years with the increasing volume of spatial data, referred to as big geospatial data, some tools have been developed to process this data e ciently, such as SpatialHadoop, a framework incorporated into Hadoop. The use of appropriate data indices based on the dataset to be processed, queries and operations to be performed is essential for the optimal performance of these applications. In particular, since public cloud providers charge based on the resources used, it is imperative to optimize application execution to avoid unnecessary expense. This paper proposes the construction of a Knowledge Base and an Inference Engine that seek to minimize the cost of processing big geospatial data in public cloud providers. In addition, a comparison of the services o ered by three public cloud providers for large-volume data processing is presented. The tests performed demonstrate that the use of rules generated by the Inference Engine and the choice of the lowest-cost provider can reduce the total processing cost by up to 71%.", "venue": "", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2018-06-21", "journal": {"name": "", "volume": ""}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2071990882", "name": "Jo\u00e3o Bachiega Junior"}], "citations": []}
