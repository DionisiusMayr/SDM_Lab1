A range of tasks are performed, and end devices are made capable of communicating with one another with the support of artificial intelligence technology. The Internet of Things (IoT) increases the efficiency of communication networks due to its low costs and simple management. However, it has been demonstrated that many systems still need an intelligent strategy for green computing. Establishing reliable connectivity in Green-IoT (G-IoT) networks is another key research challenge. With the integration of edge computing, this study provides a Sustainable Data-driven Secured optimization model (SDS-GIoT) that uses dynamic programming to provide enhanced learning capabilities. First, the proposed approach examines multi-variable functions and delivers graph-based link predictions to locate the optimal nodes for edge networks. Moreover, it identifies a sub-path in multistage to continue data transfer if a route is unavailable due to certain communication circumstances. Second, while applying security, edge computing provides offloading services that lower the amount of processing power needed for low-constraint nodes. Finally, the SDS-GIoT model is verified with various experiments, and the performance results demonstrate its significance for a sustainable environment against existing solutions.", "venue": "Italian National Conference on Sensors", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-10-01", "journal": {"name": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "volume": "22"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "48592042", "name": "T.
