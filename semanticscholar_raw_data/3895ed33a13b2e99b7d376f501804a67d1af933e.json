This important area is responsible for the development of activity recognition systems\u2014ARS (Activity Recognition Systems), which is a valuable tool when it comes to identifying the type of activity carried out by older adults, to provide them with assistance. that allows you to carry out your daily activities with complete normality. This article aims to show the review of the literature and the evolution of the different techniques for processing this type of data from supervised, unsupervised, ensembled learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning, transfer learning, and metaheuristics approach applied to this sector of science. health, showing the metrics of recent experiments for researchers in this area of knowledge. As a result of this article, it can be identified that models based on reinforcement or transfer learning constitute a good line of work for the processing and analysis of human recognition activities.", "venue": "Italian National Conference on Sensors", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-04-29", "journal": {"name": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "volume": "22"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1410507913", "name": "P.
