One such data center so called Alibaba Cloud's Data Cluster is analysed in this paper. The online services and Batch jobs co-exist in the same data cluster which leads to multiplexing of resource utilization in Cloud Data Center's. Therefore our findings and insights from this data production cluster allows the community and data center operators better understand the various workload patterns to improve the resource utilization and failure recovery design.", "venue": "2021 International Conference on Information Science and Communications Technologies (ICISCT)", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2021-11-03", "journal": {"name": "2021 International Conference on Information Science and Communications Technologies (ICISCT)", "pages": "1-5"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2285353519", "name": "Y.
