Most FL research has focused on Neural Networks while Tree-Based Models (TBMs) such as XGBoost have historically performed better on tabular data. It has been shown that subsampling of training data when building trees can improve performance but it is an open problem whether such subsampling can improve performance in FL. In this paper, we evaluate a histogram-based federated XGBoost that uses Minimal Variance Sampling (MVS). We demonstrate the underlying algorithm and show that our model using MVS can improve performance in terms of accuracy and regression error in a federated setting. In our evaluation, our model using MVS performs better than uniform (random) sampling and no sampling at all. It achieves both outstanding local and global performance on a new set of federated tabular datasets. Federated XGBoost using MVS also outperforms centralized XGBoost in half of the studied cases.", "venue": "International Conference on Fog and Mobile Edge Computing", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-09-18", "journal": {"name": "2023 Eighth International Conference on Fog and Mobile Edge Computing (FMEC)", "pages": "182-189"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2265678674", "name": "William Lindskog"}, {"authorId": "2265679180", "name": "Christian Prehofer"}, {"authorId": "2265728973", "name": "Sarandeep Singh"}], "citations": []}
