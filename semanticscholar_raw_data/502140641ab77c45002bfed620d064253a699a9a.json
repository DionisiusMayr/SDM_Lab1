Our algorithm is randomized and, per update, takes O(log^2 \u0394 log^2 n) expected time. Furthermore, the algorithm can be adjusted to have O(log^2 \u0394 log^4 n) worst-case update-time with high probability. Here, n denotes the number of vertices and \u0394 is the maximum degree in the graph. The MIS problem in fully dynamic graphs has attracted significant attention after a breakthrough result of Assadi, Onak, Schieber, and Solomon [STOC'18] who presented an algorithm with O(m^3/4) update-time (and thus broke the natural \u03a9(m) barrier) where m denotes the number of edges in the graph. This result was improved in a series of subsequent papers, though, the update-time remained polynomial. In particular, the fastest algorithm prior to our work had \u00d5 (min{\u221an, m^1/3}) update-time [Assadi et al. SODA'19]. Our algorithm maintains the lexicographically first MIS over a random order of the vertices. As a result, the same algorithm also maintains a 3-approximation of correlation clustering. We also show that a simpler variant of our algorithm can be used to maintain a random-order lexicographically first maximal matching in the same update-time.", "venue": "IEEE Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2019-09-08", "journal": {"name": "2019 IEEE 60th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS)", "pages": "382-405"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "8176576", "name": "Soheil Behnezhad"}, {"authorId": "37108088", "name": "Mahsa Derakhshan"}, {"authorId": "1704161", "name": "M.
