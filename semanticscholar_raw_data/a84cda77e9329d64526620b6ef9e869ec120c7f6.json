There aren't enough medical professionals, such as doctors or nurses, and the nearest hospitals are too far away. Because there is such a severe shortage of resources, it is extremely challenging to provide preventative therapy to persons who are ill. As a direct consequence of this, even persons in good health are falling more behind in their surveillance of their fitness. It is crucial to have a plan in place to address this problem in order to guarantee that persons will not experience a disruption in their capacity to get necessary medical care in the event that this problem arises. Applications of the Internet of Things include ensuring public safety and improving operational efficiencies in transportation, municipal management, manufacturing, and physical activity (IoT). This study investigates its application in medical equipment and suggests an innovative approach to combining the ideas of fog computing and the Internet of Things. A poor health care system that focuses on clinics can be converted into a high-quality system that puts patients at the center with the help of the framework that has been proposed.", "venue": "2022 2nd International Conference on Technological Advancements in Computational Sciences (ICTACS)", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-10-10", "journal": {"name": "2022 2nd International Conference on Technological Advancements in Computational Sciences (ICTACS)", "pages": "904-909"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2190705089", "name": "Ajay Reddy Yeruva"}, {"authorId": "2198497730", "name": "C.
