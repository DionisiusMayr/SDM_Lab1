Notably, NF outsourcing raises an essential security concern about whether these outsourced NFs and associated service function chains (SFCs) are correctly implemented according to enterprises\u2019 specifications. In particular, SFC with parallel VNFs, which take advantage of parallelism, have been conducted to reduce the traffic delay of traditional sequential SFC, called the hybrid SFC in this paper. Nevertheless, how to ensure correct behaviors and discover runtime mistakes for hybrid SFC remains an open problem.In this paper, we propose vHSFC, a verification scheme for hybrid SFC, enabling enterprises to verify the correctness of SFC enforcement in real-time. vHSFC achieves its goal with a lightweight verified routing protocol, which detects various hybrid SFC violations and attacks, i.e., packet modification, incompliant forwarding path, etc. To demonstrate the feasibility and performance of vHSFC, we have implemented the prototype on top of several containers and conducted extensive experiments with real traffic. The experimental results show that our vHSFC can continuously ensure proper enforcement and discover unexpected violations while incurring sensible overhead.", "venue": "International Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work in Design", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-05-24", "journal": {"name": "2023 26th International Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work in Design (CSCWD)", "pages": "498-503"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2118530504", "name": "Sheng Chen"}, {"authorId": "2185512468", "name": "Jinxi Li"}, {"authorId": "2108427217", "name": "Baochao Chen"}, {"authorId": "144233921", "name": "Deke Guo"}, {"authorId": "143668329", "name": "Keqiu Li"}], "citations": []}
