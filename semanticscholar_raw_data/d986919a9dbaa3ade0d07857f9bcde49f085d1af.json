However, this behavior poses a risk for the privacy of clients since these services are able to generate profiles containing very sensitive information, e.g., vulnerability information or collaboration partners. Hence, a rising need for protocols that enable clients to obtain knowledge without revealing their requests exists. To address this issue, we propose a protocol that enables clients (i) to query large cloud-based knowledge systems in a privacy-preserving manner using Private Set Intersection and (ii) to subsequently obtain individual knowledge items without leaking the client\u2019s requests via few Oblivious Transfers. With our preliminary design, we allow clients to save a significant amount of time in comparison to performing Oblivious Transfers only.", "venue": "IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2019-10-01", "journal": {"name": "2019 IEEE 27th International Conference on Network Protocols (ICNP)", "pages": "1-2"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1382610408", "name": "Markus Dahlmanns"}, {"authorId": "1382610400", "name": "Chris Dax"}, {"authorId": "2786588", "name": "Roman Matzutt"}, {"authorId": "3425128", "name": "J.
