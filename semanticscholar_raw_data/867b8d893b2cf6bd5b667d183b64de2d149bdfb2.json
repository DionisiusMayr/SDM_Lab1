Connectivity between vehicles and the MEC system is likely to be realized through the mobile network. However, platoons will be composed of vehicles that are customers of different co-located mobile operators, hence\u2013 in all likelihood\u2013 will also be customers of different MEC systems. In this paper, we devise and evaluate an architectural framework that realizes Platooning-as-a-Service (PlaaS) in a multi-operator MEC environment, compliant with the ETSI MEC standard: we describe the entities involved and their interactions, we release an open-source proof-of-concept implementation for the popular Simu5G simulator, and we evaluate the effect of our framework\u2013 and especially its latencies\u2013 on platoon stability.", "venue": "IEEE Access", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "IEEE Access", "pages": "60040-60058", "volume": "11"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "35564698", "name": "G.
