This tutorial comprehensively studies how existing works extend Apache Spark to uphold massive-scale spatial data. During this 1.5 hour tutorial, we first provide a background introduction of the characteristics of spatial data and the history of distributed data management systems. A follow-up section presents the common approaches used by the practitioners to extend Spark and introduces the vital components in a generic spatial data management system. The third, fourth and fifth sections then discuss the ongoing efforts and experience in spatial-temporal data, spatial data analytics and streaming spatial data, respectively. The sixth part finally concludes this tutorial to help the audience better grasp the overall content and points out future research directions.", "venue": "IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2019-04-01", "journal": {"name": "2019 IEEE 35th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE)", "pages": "2060-2063"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "97583810", "name": "Jia Yu"}, {"authorId": "1769421", "name": "Mohamed Sarwat"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "bc94474c789dfd29a6b4788072b3a648c8bf773d", "title": "Kernel Density Visualization for Big Geospatial Data: Algorithms and Applications"}, {"paperId": "90f3b5db0af7b797cbb481a55b0a970875863287", "title": "Large-scale Geospatial Analytics: Problems, Challenges, and Opportunities"}, {"paperId": "f40f36da5dcfed647b254e24d68fae6daa4131d8", "title": "Spatial joins: what's next?"}, {"paperId": "675b44a3993d33fa06a2490e7c603b78841e8efe", "title": "Big Maritime Data Management"}]}
