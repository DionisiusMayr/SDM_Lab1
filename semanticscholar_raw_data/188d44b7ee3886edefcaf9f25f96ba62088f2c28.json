Several interesting approaches were proposed; however, as of writing this paper and to the best of our knowledge, there are no comprehensive surveys that thoroughly examine the gaps, trends and trajectories of this area. To fill this void, we, therefore, present a review of the state-of-art benchmarking and performance modelling efforts in data-intensive applications. We start by introducing the two most common dataflow patterns used, for each of these patterns, we review their approach to benchmarking, modelling and validation & experimental environments. Furthermore, we construct a taxonomy and classification to provide a deep understanding of the focus areas of this domain and identify the opportunities for further research. We conclude by analysing each research gap and highlighting future trends.", "venue": "2020 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Big Data Computing, Applications and Technologies (BDCAT)", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2020-12-01", "journal": {"name": "2020 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Big Data Computing, Applications and Technologies (BDCAT)", "pages": "67-76"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "29970036", "name": "Sheriffo Ceesay"}, {"authorId": "2116262560", "name": "Yuhui Lin"}, {"authorId": "2445185", "name": "A.
