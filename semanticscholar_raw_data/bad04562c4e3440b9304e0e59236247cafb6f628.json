This is due to the importance of the novel; In that it was one of the most famous types of prose literary arts in absorbing reality and portraying it in a brilliant artistic manner. Given the remarkable development that the Saudi novel has witnessed and its prominent position in the Arab literary space; I devoted my studies to talking about a novel from Najran literature (Shayuot) by the writer (Hatem Hussein Hatem). In my research, I focused on the personality element. Its role in constructing the novel and presenting its events. It also focused on the mechanisms of recruiting the main characters in the novel, and the relationship of the character element to other narrative elements: (place, time, language, and plot).
