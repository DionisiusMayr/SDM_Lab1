Nevertheless, existing methods often learn features that exhibit correlations between instruction-formatted samples and target labels, rather than causal relationships. Termed as ``spurious correlation'' in statistics, such a correlation may change drastically in a new task, making the effect from the learned features to be misleading. To this end, we develop a meta Structural Causal Model (meta-SCM) to integrate different NLP tasks under a single causal structure of the data. Specifically, the meta-SCM introduces multiple latent factors that represent properties of source context, only some of which causally influence the target labels for a specific task. The key idea is to learn task-required causal factors and only use those to make predictions for a given task. Theoretically, we prove the causal factor can be identified without mixing information from others. Guided by the identifiability, we propose a Structural Instruction Tuning (SIT) method to learn the task-required causal representations that can mimic the causal factors for each task. The utility of our approach is verified by improvements of zero-shot ability on a range of unseen datasets and tasks.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-02-09", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2402.06220"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2145146592", "name": "Luyao Chen"}, {"authorId": "2269025009", "name": "Wei-Ren Huang"}, {"authorId": "2109960367", "name": "Ruqing Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2256716717", "name": "Wei Chen"}, {"authorId": "1777025", "name": "J.
