To build a UDT model, it needs a comprehensive 3D representation of the city's terrain, buildings, and infrastructure. In order to effectively visualize and manage large-scale spatial data in 3D, it is essential to establish and maintain an appropriate level of detail (LoD) for the 3D model. This study proposes to construct and manage LoDs for VWorld building data. However, since buildings are often composed of non-closed boundary models, applying a quadric mesh-based simplification algorithm may result in the deletion of meshes containing important contour information that defines the shape of the building. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes to use a geometric filtering algorithm to preserve the building outline shape.", "venue": "", "year": null, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2294677626", "name": "Ahyun Lee"}], "citations": []}
