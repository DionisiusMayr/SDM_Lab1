We also use an improved Semantic-Based Keyword Matching Algorithm to deal with duplicate data. Experimental results show that this parallelized framework with improved Semantic-Based Keyword Matching Algorithm can identify duplicates with high recall and precision and have a good performance for big data cleansing.", "venue": "International Conference on Security, Pattern Analysis, and Cybernetics", "year": 2014, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2014-12-15", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings 2014 IEEE International Conference on Security, Pattern Analysis, and Cybernetics (SPAC)", "pages": "448-453"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2144547692", "name": "Jia Wang"}, {"authorId": "2114791240", "name": "Zhijun Song"}, {"authorId": "2130969318", "name": "Qian Li"}, {"authorId": "2117884196", "name": "Jun Yu"}, {"authorId": "2157325936", "name": "Fei Chen"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "d1d846946d637a4d156bd97143800f18439e698e", "title": "A Vision for Semantically Enriched Data Science"}, {"paperId": "bbee7a657c26ce79a56de3fdf100164d478efb04", "title": "A Survey on Semantics in Automated Data Science"}, {"paperId": "4a3f4d7952cb6c7ae8a607ab35bd0978706b285d", "title": "An Electric Power Sensor Data Oriented Data Cleaning Solution"}, {"paperId": "91888b17e34fb24ac2848bf7cc4564faabd6a440", "title": "Ins and Outs of Big Data: A Review"}, {"paperId": "66966e3ceb64e8bc511174684947e9a952e85305", "title": "Handling big data: research challenges and future directions"}]}
