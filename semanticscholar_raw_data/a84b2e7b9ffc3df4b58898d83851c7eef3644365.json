The three introduced tools are not only suitable for operating in business intelligence to serve high-performance data retrieval, but they are also an open-source software solution with low cost for small-to-medium enterprise use. In practice, the proposed approach provides an in-memory cache and an in-disk cache to achieve a very fast response to a query if a cache hit occurs. Moreover, this paper develops so-called platform selection that is able to select the appropriate tool dealing with input query with effectiveness and efficiency. As a result, the speed of job execution of proposed approach using platform selection is 2.63 times faster than Hive in the Case 1 experiment, and 4.57 times faster in the Case 2 experiment.", "venue": "Applied Sciences", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2018-09-01", "journal": {"name": "Applied Sciences"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1711452", "name": "B.
