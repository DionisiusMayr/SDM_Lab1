Post-production inspection, which can be expensive and time-consuming, is used in traditional quality control systems. To overcome this, we proposed a Modified gravitational search algorithm-based decision tree (MGSA-DT) to predict the quality of manufacturing processes at an early stage. We gathered sensors data in the manufacturing industry. In order to prepare the data for principal component analysis (PCA), Z-score normalization is used. Then, the essential features are extracted from the preprocessed data. To assess the effectiveness of the suggested approach in terms of accuracy (98.4%), precision (97.6%) and recall (97.2%), respectively. Implementing early quality detection techniques in manufacturing has demonstrated encouraging outcomes in enhancing the overall quality of products and decreasing production expenses.", "venue": "Proceedings on Engineering Sciences", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-03-20", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings on Engineering Sciences"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2293567681", "name": "Swati Singh"}, {"authorId": "2294770029", "name": "Raman Batra Keerti"}, {"authorId": "2294767316", "name": "Rai S.
