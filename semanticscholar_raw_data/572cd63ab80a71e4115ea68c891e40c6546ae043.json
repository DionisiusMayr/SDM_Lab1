One of functionalities of the platform is to detect fertile days basing on often incomplete and uncertain data provided by the users. Besides discussing the particular layers of the underlying OvuFriend\u2019s system architecture, we concentrate on one of the proposed fertile day detection models which is based on the idea of utilizing multivariate similarities between the current cycle and the past cycles available for the given user or for users who have a similar profile, with an additional self-checking procedure that enables the algorithm to neglect insufficiently reliable inputs.", "venue": "2018 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2018-12-01", "journal": {"name": "2018 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "pages": "2663-2668"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2477716", "name": "Lukasz Sosnowski"}, {"authorId": "66368346", "name": "Wojciech Chaber"}, {"authorId": "65747929", "name": "Lukasz Milobedzki"}, {"authorId": "3455434", "name": "T.
