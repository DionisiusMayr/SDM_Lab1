Analyzing the data transmission process, it is found that the data layer has problems such as complex data requests, close data dependencies, and data display differences. In response to the above problems, this paper proposes a data-driven general data layer component model and develops this model with Vue components at the same time. Schema fusion implements a common data transfer mechanism. Based on the component model of the data layer, middleware such as adapters, assemblers, collectors, and converters are designed, and the data layer is operable, universal, and Configurable purpose.", "venue": "Journal of Physics: Conference Series", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Physics"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-07-01", "journal": {"name": "Journal of Physics: Conference Series", "volume": "2303"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2057610927", "name": "Shiyong Xiong"}, {"authorId": "2179458889", "name": "Jingjing Kong"}, {"authorId": "2179648540", "name": "Yulong Zhou"}], "citations": []}
