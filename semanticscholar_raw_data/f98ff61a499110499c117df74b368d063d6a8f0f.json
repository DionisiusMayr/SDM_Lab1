This paper presents the design of a novel lightweight protocol called the Enhanced Lightweight Security Gateway Protocol (ELSGP) based on a distributed computation model of the IoT layer. This model introduces a new type of node called a sub-server to assist edge layer servers and IoT devices with computational tasks and act as a primary gateway for dependent IoT nodes. This paper then introduces six features of ELSGP with developed algorithms that include access token distribution and validation, authentication and dynamic interoperability, attribute-based access control, traffic filtering, secure tunneling, and dynamic load distribution and balancing. Considering the variability of system requirements, ELSGP also outlines how to adopt a system-defined policy framework. For fault resiliency, this paper also presents fault mitigation mechanisms, especially Trust and Priority Impact Relation for Byzantine, Cascading, and Transient faults. A simulation study was carried out to validate the protocol\u2019s performance. Based on the findings from the performance evaluation, further analysis of the protocol and future research directions are outlined.", "venue": "Social Science Research Network", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-10-12", "journal": {"name": "SSRN Electronic Journal"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "147580221", "name": "Masum Reza"}, {"authorId": "144536399", "name": "Jairo Guti\u00e9rrez"}], "citations": []}
