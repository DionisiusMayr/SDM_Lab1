Our model is trained with the TPUGraphs dataset, containing over 13 million pairs of graphs and compilation configurations. To extract meaningful information from the graph-structured data, we use different Graph Neural Networks (GNN) architectures as the backbone of the pipeline, followed by a reduction and feed-forward step. An important takeaway is that a transformation of the raw, one-hot-encoded features into a more abstract representation, is essential for the network to extract meaningful node embeddings. In our work, these embeddings are produced using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) trained concurrently to the full pipeline. Among the different models explored in our work, the Graph Attention Network (GAT) achieved the best results, by weighting the importance of specific neighbors of nodes in the graph structure.", "venue": "", "year": null, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2279222183", "name": "Gabriel Gramm"}, {"authorId": "2083572783", "name": "Florian Gr\u00f6tschla"}, {"authorId": "2279221491", "name": "Jo\u00ebl Mathys Prof"}, {"authorId": "2226647614", "name": "Dr. Roger Wattenhofer"}], "citations": []}
