This result continuously generates several exabytes of unstructured sensor data and so it is often called big climate data. Nowadays, researchers are trying to use big climate data to monitor and predict the climate change and possible diseases. Traditional data processing techniques and tools are not capable of handling such huge amount of climate data. Hence, there is a need to develop advanced big data architecture for processing the real time climate data. The purpose of this paper is to propose a big data based surveillance system that analyzes spatial climate big data and performs continuous monitoring of correlation between climate change and Dengue. Proposed disease surveillance system has been implemented with the help of Apache Hadoop MapReduce and its supporting tools.", "venue": "International Journal of Ambient Computing and Intelligence (IJACI)", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2017-04-01", "journal": {"name": "Int.
