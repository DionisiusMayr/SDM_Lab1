With an increasing number of devices and systems in use, amount and the value of data, the risks of security breaches increase. One of these risks is posed by open data sources, by which are meant databases, which are not properly protected. These poorly protected databases are accessible to external actors, which poses a serious risk to the data holder and the results of data-related activities such as analysis, forecasting, monitoring, decision-making, policy development, and the whole contemporary society. This chapter aims at examining the state of the security of open data databases representing both relational databases and NoSQL, with a particular focus on a later category.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-06-23", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2206.11787"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "34530294", "name": "Anastasija Nikiforova"}, {"authorId": "2148555443", "name": "Artjoms Daskevics"}, {"authorId": "40866415", "name": "Otmane Azeroual"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "b904dcdbd7c7b33938583f2f57d05ca70e121ea9", "title": "An Efficient and Secure Big Data Storage in Cloud Environment by Using Triple Data Encryption Standard"}, {"paperId": "49a44858d657da860c20deaf650774a08d232af3", "title": "An Ef\ufb01cient and Secure Big Data Storage in Cloud Environment by Using Triple Data Encryption Standard"}]}
