For a chatbot which responds to millions of online users including minors, we argue that it should have a healthy mental tendency in order to avoid the negative psychological impact on them. In this paper, we establish several mental health assessment dimensions for chatbots (depression, anxiety, alcohol addiction, empathy) and introduce the questionnaire-based mental health assessment methods. We conduct assessments on some well-known open-domain chatbots and find that there are severe mental health issues for all these chatbots. We consider that it is due to the neglect of the mental health risks during the dataset building and the model training procedures. We expect to attract researchers' attention to the serious mental health problems of chatbots and improve the chatbots' ability in positive emotional interaction.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-01-14", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2201.05382"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "152131170", "name": "Yong Shan"}, {"authorId": "2108970018", "name": "Jinchao Zhang"}, {"authorId": "15401738", "name": "Zekang Li"}, {"authorId": "144599698", "name": "Yang Feng"}, {"authorId": "49178343", "name": "Jie Zhou"}], "citations": []}
