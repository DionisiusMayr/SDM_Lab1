Thus, the purpose of this study is to determine whether the modified technology acceptance model (MTAM) is viable for evaluating the performance of librarians in the use of big data analytics in academic libraries. This study used an empirical research method for collecting data from 211 librarians working in Pakistan\u2019s universities. On the basis of the findings of the MTAM analysis by structural equation modelling, the performances of the academic libraries were comprehended through the process of big data. The main influential components of the performance analysis in this study were the big data analytics capabilities, perceived ease of access and the usefulness of big data practices in academic libraries. Subsequently, the utilisation of big data was significantly affected by skills, perceived ease of access and the usefulness of academic libraries. The results also suggested that the various components of the academic libraries lead to effective organisational performance when linked to big data analytics.", "venue": "Journal of information science", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Political Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-05-12", "journal": {"name": "Journal of Information Science", "pages": "458 - 471", "volume": "47"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2055583997", "name": "A.
