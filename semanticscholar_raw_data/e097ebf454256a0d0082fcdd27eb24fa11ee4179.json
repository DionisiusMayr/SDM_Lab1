These distinct merits make it a promising tool for IoT-based machine signal processing and fault diagnosis. This article reviews the edge computing methods in signal processing-based machine fault diagnosis from the aspects of concepts, state-of-the-art methods, case studies, and research prospects. In particular, the lightweight designed algorithms and application-specific hardware platforms of edge computing in the typical fault diagnosis procedures, including signal acquisition, signal preprocessing, feature extraction, and pattern recognition, are reviewed and discussed in detail. The review provides an insight into the edge computing framework, methods, and applications, so as to meet the requirements of IoT-based machine real-time signal processing, low-latency fault diagnosis, and high-efficient predictive maintenance.", "venue": "IEEE Internet of Things Journal", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-07-01", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Internet of Things Journal", "pages": "11093-11116", "volume": "10"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "101396936", "name": "Siliang Lu"}, {"authorId": "2115404643", "name": "Jinfeng Lu"}, {"authorId": "2053459476", "name": "Kang An"}, {"authorId": "153315864", "name": "Xiaoxian Wang"}, {"authorId": "2152880230", "name": "Qingbo He"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "3abdf4c2e0093a9ac08f2be0cbe75eb31cc24db6", "title": "Federated Domain Generalization: A Secure and Robust Framework for Intelligent Fault Diagnosis"}, {"paperId": "cf8030deece6d896c882e5ead57edc4d3e983ead", "title": "Progress in Privacy Protection: A Review of Privacy Preserving Techniques in Recommender Systems, Edge Computing, and Cloud Computing"}, {"paperId": "27d98ade30e579893c96c4317e58ecdccf12239c", "title": "IoT-Based Framework for Digital Twins in the Industry 5.0 Era"}, {"paperId": "af2e37cf6082d3bb5967ce08e009c520543b8cd8", "title": "A Geohash-Based Location-Aware Computing Resource Sharing System"}, {"paperId": "b306275cc8e5b6874b64f643717ea2a22bd8b612", "title": "A Blockchain-enabled Secure Access Management Method in Edge Computing"}, {"paperId": "6fc6849c72a49d627290331c2d451191d197f86c", "title": "Survey on Foundation Models for Prognostics and Health Management in Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems"}, {"paperId": "4473c2059e539b291315670e873971848b4f76ae", "title": "RibesDB: A Time-Series Database at Edge for the Industrial Internet of Things"}, {"paperId": "1e794161b760e456187292443428d59d48cfca17", "title": "PELS: A Lightweight and Flexible Peripheral Event Linking System for Ultra-Low Power IoT Processors"}, {"paperId": "c1fd710a5203b7086737c4d542582961d54356bd", "title": "Multi-Dimensional Security Indicator Design and Optimization for DDoS Detection in Edge Computing"}, {"paperId": "a74eb9e6e5fd28a935775608a03122209e6be161", "title": "Magnetic signal denoising based on auxiliary sensor array and deep noise reconstruction"}, {"paperId": "c0c46d27b0a73be15810998895544f0ff8a2e555", "title": "Anomaly Detection in a Smart Industrial Machinery Plant Using IoT and Machine Learning"}, {"paperId": "0fafc94fa0cfd0bbd6a9379eb8e1ebea28892c3b", "title": "Self-C2AD: Enhancing CA Auditing in IoT with Self-Enforcement Based on an SM2 Signature Algorithm"}, {"paperId": "1f0c37be698e1d4a6c8cf68b3d9d03186a8548be", "title": "ATHENA I -
