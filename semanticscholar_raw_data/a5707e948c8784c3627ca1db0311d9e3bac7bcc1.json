In our common production use cases, where streaming workloads have to meet latency targets and avoid breaching service-level agreements, existing solutions are incapable of handling the wide variability of user needs. Our framework called Cameo uses \ufb01ne-grained stream processing (inspired by actor computation models), and is able to provide high resource utilization while meeting latency targets. Cameo dynamically calculates and propagates priorities of events based on user latency targets and query semantics. Experiments on Microsoft Azure show that compared to state-of-the-art, the Cameo framework: i) reduces query latency by 2.7 \u00d7 in single tenant settings, ii) reduces query latency by 4.6 \u00d7 in multi-tenant scenarios, and iii) weathers transient spikes of workload.", "venue": "", "year": null, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "153152418", "name": "Le Xu"}, {"authorId": "2261875235", "name": "Shivaram Venkataraman"}, {"authorId": "2261833208", "name": "Indranil Gupta"}, {"authorId": "2261877414", "name": "Luo Mai"}, {"authorId": "3097319", "name": "Rahul Potharaju"}], "citations": []}
