However, an undesirable side-effect of this modular design is the large state space of possibly inter-dependent configuration parameters (of the constituent microservices) which have to be tuned to improve application performance. This workshop paper investigates optimization techniques and dimensionality reduction strategies for tuning microservices applications, empirically demonstrating the significant tail latency improvements (as much as 23%) that can be achieved with configuration tuning.", "venue": "EuroMLSys@EuroSys", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-04-26", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 1st Workshop on Machine Learning and Systems"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1454029001", "name": "Gagan Somashekar"}, {"authorId": "2044504", "name": "Anshul Gandhi"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "755067c6587f88e41a65a7f4ca2b6f1a99bdf463", "title": "MALT: Fine-Grained Microservice Profiling for Request Latency Anomaly Localization"}, {"paperId": "54447497f9bce31263c2bcc0763102c5916da65e", "title": "Sora: A Latency Sensitive Approach for Microservice Soft Resource Adaptation"}, {"paperId": "6259ad4d0992252b72b0e6af0d19b03ddcba6d9e", "title": "Blueprint: A Toolchain for Highly-Reconfigurable Microservice Applications"}, {"paperId": "d09037b3bd6eb44098bbd2b9255cc9afa721fc64", "title": "Towards Performance Management of Large-Scale Microservices Applications"}, {"paperId": "f54b031f24df73a4616cc1673eaf78b279b5afed", "title": "CoTuner: A Hierarchical Learning Framework for Coordinately Optimizing Resource Partitioning and Parameter Tuning"}, {"paperId": "a6f11e034bba8fe17e1964805fff892b56a53c9e", "title": "A study on Microservices and Application Programming Interface vulnerabilities"}, {"paperId": "5f866afc767faf3d44d7d58f68874267f0f4f55e", "title": "AI Techniques in the Microservices Life-Cycle: A Survey"}, {"paperId": "b6b5bf11c18c0ef0a2cc4e2087a04fcc48648731", "title": "Improving Storage Systems Using Machine Learning"}, {"paperId": "b8bba3b588f765f9dfe4aa3d63ac97cfca14b20c", "title": "B-MEG: Bottlenecked-Microservices Extraction Using Graph Neural Networks"}, {"paperId": "d456a30f9d2f01d31cf81e41a1df56b9af4e35dc", "title": "Phronesis: Efficient Performance Modeling for High-dimensional Configuration Tuning"}, {"paperId": "a7969701b09ecb2be0338f61d7065c0aca17307a", "title": "Optimizing microservices with hyperparameter optimization"}, {"paperId": "c06649333f631cf3c934a1e82ce45bf0617801c8", "title": "KML: Using Machine Learning to Improve Storage Systems"}, {"paperId": "940d956a6858eabaaf346962f383cdc2746b89fc", "title": "A Learning-based Approach Towards Automated Tuning of SSD Configurations"}, {"paperId": "3ba085792b1ea40a008da16f71f431b357d6f586", "title": "On Microservice Analysis and Architecture Evolution: A Systematic Mapping Study"}, {"paperId": "1b733fddb370e38f89e17dddefb015c61fa2459d", "title": "SelfTune: Tuning Cluster Managers"}]}
