The Lightning Talks at WORKS focus on describing a novel tool, scientific workflow, or concept, which are work-in-progress and address emerging technologies and frameworks to foster discussion in the community. This paper summarizes the lightning talks at the 2023 edition of WORKS, covering five topics: leveraging large language models to build and execute workflows; developing a common workflow scheduler interface; scaling uncertainty workflow applications on exascale computing systems; evaluating a transcriptomics workflow for cloud vs. HPC systems; and best practices in migrating legacy workflows to workflow management systems.", "venue": "SC Workshops", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-11-12", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the SC '23 Workshops of The International Conference on High Performance Computing, Network, Storage, and Analysis"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2062906007", "name": "Jonathan Bader"}, {"authorId": "2266399897", "name": "Jim Belak"}, {"authorId": "2266203965", "name": "Matt Bement"}, {"authorId": "2266402214", "name": "Matthew Berry"}, {"authorId": "2266400356", "name": "Robert Carson"}, {"authorId": "2266399122", "name": "Daniela Cassol"}, {"authorId": "2266420078", "name": "Stephen Chan"}, {"authorId": "2266205471", "name": "John Coleman"}, {"authorId": "2266401980", "name": "Kastan Day"}, {"authorId": "2266399207", "name": "Alejandro Duque"}, {"authorId": "2211840", "name": "Kjiersten Fagnan"}, {"authorId": "2266401850", "name": "Jeff Froula"}, {"authorId": "1693678", "name": "S.
