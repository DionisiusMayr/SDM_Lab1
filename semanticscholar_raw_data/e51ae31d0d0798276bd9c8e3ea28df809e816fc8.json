While programmable and interactive interfaces such as widgets embedded within computational notebooks are suitable for these workflows, they lack robust state management capabilities and do not support user-defined customization of the interactive components. The absence of such capabilities hinders workflow reusability and transparency while limiting the scope of exploration of the end-users. In response, we developed Magneton, a framework for authoring interactive widgets within computational notebooks that enables transparent, reusable, and customizable data science workflows. The framework enhances existing widgets to support fine-grained interaction history management, reusable states, and user-defined customizations. We conducted three case studies in a real-world knowledge graph construction and serving platform to evaluate the effectiveness of these widgets. Based on the observations, we discuss future implications of employing Magneton widgets for general-purpose data science workflows.", "venue": "CHI Extended Abstracts", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book"], "publicationDate": "2023-03-23", "journal": {"name": "Extended Abstracts of the 2023 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2111720780", "name": "Frederick Choi"}, {"authorId": "37455401", "name": "Sajjadur Rahman"}, {"authorId": "2143468335", "name": "H.
