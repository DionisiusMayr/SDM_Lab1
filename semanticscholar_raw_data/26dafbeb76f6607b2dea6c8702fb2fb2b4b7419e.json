This leads to a lack of consistent semantics for users and developers, leading to inefficiencies and even dangerous misunderstandings. We summarize a modern retake of well-known concepts, for generalizing multi-tenant application semantics, in highly distributed systems. By implementing some standard infrastructure, one could easily enable both the self-documentation and friendly coexistence of multiple applications, at any scale.", "venue": "", "year": 2016, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "145907404", "name": "M.
