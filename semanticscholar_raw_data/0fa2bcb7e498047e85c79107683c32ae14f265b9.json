However, there are few comprehensive data sets that address social inequality and equity across multiple infrastructure sectors, determinants, and outcomes, particularly at fine intra\u2010urban spatial scales. This paper: (1) Offers an overarching conceptualization of inequality and equity in multi\u2010sector urban systems; (2) Introduces a broad data framework to assess inequality and equity across social (S), ecological (E), infrastructural (I), and urban (U) form determinants (SEIU) and environment (E), health (H), well\u2010being (W), and economy and security (E) outcomes (EHWE), identifying a universe of >110 SEIU\u2013EHWE data layers (variables) of interest; (3) Provides an illustrative data case study of a US city that synthesizes publicly available sources of the associated SEIU\u2013EHWE data attributes, noting their availability/gaps at fine spatial scales, important to inform social inequality; (4) Discusses analytic methods to quantify inequality and spatial correlates across SEIU determinants and EHWE outcomes; and, (5) Demonstrates several use\u2010cases of the data framework and companion analytic methods through real\u2010world applied case studies that inform equity planning in applications ranging from energy sector investments to air pollution and health. The US data case study reveals data availability (covering 41 of the 113 data layers) as well as major gaps associated with EHWE outcomes at fine spatial scales, while the application examples demonstrate practical use. Overall, the SEIU\u2013EHWE data framework provides an anchor for systematically gathering, analyzing, and informing multiple dimensions of inequality and equity in sustainable urban systems.", "venue": "Journal of Industrial Ecology", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-01-15", "journal": {"name": "Journal of Industrial Ecology", "pages": "145 - 163", "volume": "26"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "97820334", "name": "Lara P.
