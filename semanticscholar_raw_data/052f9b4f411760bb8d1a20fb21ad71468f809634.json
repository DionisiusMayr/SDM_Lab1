Complexity in the city sensing section is caused by the complexity of urban systems. The enormous number of sensor types and technologies utilized for municipal data collecting provide a problem. Some of the issues in city sensing are node deployment, sensing management, sensor network types, and their derivative variables, necessitating the development of a city sensing architecture capable of contributing to advances in efficiency, accuracy, and real-timeness.", "venue": "International Conferences on Information Science and System", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-09-06", "journal": {"name": "2023 10th International Conference on ICT for Smart Society (ICISS)", "pages": "1-7"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2261953832", "name": "Mindit Eriyadi"}, {"authorId": "2774694", "name": "S.
