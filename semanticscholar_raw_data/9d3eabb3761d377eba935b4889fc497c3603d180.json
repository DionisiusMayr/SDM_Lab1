But \"pure\" Datalog is limited to monotone queries, and cannot be used in most practical applications. For that reason, newer systems are relaxing the language by allowing non-monotone queries to be freely combined with recursion. But by departing from the elegant fixpoint semantics of pure datalog, these systems often result in inefficient query execution, for example they perform redundant computations, or use redundant storage. In this paper, we propose Temporel, a system that allows recursion to be freely combined with non-monotone operators. Temporel optimizes the program by compiling it into a novel intermediate representation that we call TempoDL. Our experimental results show that our system outperforms a state-of-the-art Datalog engine as well as a vectorized and a compiled in-memory database system for a wide range of applications from machine learning to graph processing.", "venue": "Proceedings of the ACM on Management of Data", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-03-12", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the ACM on Management of Data"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2242632853", "name": "Amir Shaikhha"}, {"authorId": "2294046183", "name": "Dan Suciu"}, {"authorId": "3416110", "name": "Maximilian Schleich"}, {"authorId": "2282533816", "name": "Hung Ngo"}], "citations": []}
