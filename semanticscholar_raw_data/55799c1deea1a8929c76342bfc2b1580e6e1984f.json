By predicting students' performance, we can identify students' risk of academic failure and help instructors to take some actions such as guidance or interventions to help learners as early as possible, or carry out continual evaluation of learners as to optimize learning path or personalized learning resources recommendation. In this survey, we reviewed the 80 important studies on predicting students' performance using EDM methods in 2016\u20132021, synthesized the procedure of building prediction model of students' performance which contains four phases and 10 key steps, and compared and discussed the latest EDM methods used in all steps. We analyzed the challenges faced by previous studies in three aspects and put forward future suggestions on data collection, EDM methods used, and interpretation of prediction model. This survey provides a comprehensive understanding and practical guide for researchers in this field, and also provides direction for further research.", "venue": "Engineering Reports", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2021-12-13", "journal": {"name": "Engineering Reports", "volume": "4"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "144780150", "name": "Wen Xiao"}, {"authorId": "2001001182", "name": "Ping Ji"}, {"authorId": "2117230547", "name": "Juan Hu"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "e35f53ca7d77c70c75ae5fd2f11b25254ca4d841", "title": "Understanding the stumbling blocks of Italian higher education system: A process mining approach"}, {"paperId": "64813b14cb314382a1f40149360d9f1a882e6c49", "title": "Improving Academic Advising by Predicting a Student\u2019s GPA given their Chosen Courses"}, {"paperId": "2b18bdb9f4a5cccaf134ecc7690ef305b2e70439", "title": "Student learning performance prediction based on online behavior: an empirical study during the COVID-19 pandemic"}, {"paperId": "9f9097c2eaff0fdba488da962ef7e3c960364e57", "title": "Applying Educational Data Mining to Classify Students in an Intelligent Tutoring System for Algebra Instruction"}, {"paperId": "3b73f5d823905daaad91eb320341be549317a352", "title": "Enhancing Grade Prediction in WE Learn Mobile Classroom Using Clustering-based Decision Tree"}, {"paperId": "1a999212d0c93e6d2f253a6cb1dd26f77742f970", "title": "An intelligent method for identifying family education patterns based on a random forest algorithm"}, {"paperId": "f473f903e3c1ccf27a4c5ae292ee3a617b4b1903", "title": "A bibliometric analysis of Educational Data Mining studies in global perspective"}, {"paperId": "41da4e3a30c4d7b915ba6dea0a9f2ff0a4ae36fa", "title": "Application in Student Performance Prediction Using Graph Regularization Nonnegative Matrix Factorization"}, {"paperId": "cc45a6c594cf240a1326b864253ba2f08e7305af", "title": "Early Prediction of Students\u2019 Performance Using a Deep Neural Network Based on Online Learning Activity Sequence"}, {"paperId": "4874c26784c81e2fedb64c23340f38a6bf488765", "title": "The Sequence Matters in Learning - A Systematic Literature Review"}, {"paperId": "1b04b591e692865ac07999be670e31ab77559f66", "title": "EARLY IDENTIFICATION OF ACADEMIC FAILURE ON HIGHER EDUCATION: PREDICTING STUDENTS\u2019 PERFORMANCE USING AI"}, {"paperId": "a0e645f5bfba36d79b3fc728119350b4fc7bb93d", "title": "Forecasting Students' Employment Rate Under the OBE Model"}, {"paperId": "f79f88ce66c7fb7d4638360a2ebdab32e1576228", "title": "Using Educational Data Mining to Predict Student Academic Performance"}, {"paperId": "42b9b0b8326d45d3ba9fe9a1d5c046c36b21508b", "title": "Student Performance Analysis using Bayesian Optimized Random Forest Classifier and KNN"}, {"paperId": "b8ceb9a89ade1ef2f67a6e58cb5d34f3b1a00360", "title": "Improving Learning Outcomes through Predictive Analytics: Enhancing Teaching and Learning with Educational Data Mining"}, {"paperId": "37691fae27c0a3ac73daa75045c0f0c30d2fce6f", "title": "The Secret Sauce of Student Success: Cracking the Code by Navigating the Path to Personalized Learning with Educational Data Mining"}, {"paperId": "97a10005e3ef47064657f15a42000586cdfe84e8", "title": "Predicting and Comparing Students\u2019 Online and Offline Academic Performance Using Machine Learning Algorithms"}, {"paperId": "ec45fa52bd4b21d5650eda1478269f74e2f70bc8", "title": "Early detection of student degree-level academic performance using educational data mining"}, {"paperId": "688ffa8dde9bfabbaafe2c2ca8e1db7417f16dcc", "title": "A state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art survey of predicting students' performance using artificial neural networks"}, {"paperId": "f244afaf89dfcc364f7331c5f2541a11b40a6761", "title": "An application of Bayesian inference to examine student retention and attrition in the STEM classroom"}, {"paperId": "69520756402a8e286fefb83670225a01028cb1dc", "title": "A review of clustering models in educational data science towards fairness-aware learning"}, {"paperId": "d62674366e272f1e97e0d4a94cd4aefeb32d496e", "title": "A PREDICITON MODEL BASED ON STUDENTS\u2019S BEHAVIOR IN E-LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS USING DATA MINING TECHNIQUES"}, {"paperId": "920556d6b378975000b34b64255544145a304aad", "title": "Beyond Predictive Learning Analytics Modelling and onto Explainable Artificial Intelligence with Prescriptive Analytics and ChatGPT"}, {"paperId": "5c7a89ebeeda93db22085785b0fc2c0607592987", "title": "Evaluation of group fairness measures in student performance prediction problems"}, {"paperId": "0971c126deccaa67fcfe09ccdb038953c531fd1d", "title": "Teachers in Distance Education During the COVID-19 Pandemic.
