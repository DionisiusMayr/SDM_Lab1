Besides, the movement of the anomaly data in the tremendous datasets is a key basic to the investigation business. Thusly, this paper proposes a novel strategy for dealing with the huge data using Spark structure. The proposed strategy encounters two phases for orchestrating the gigantic data, which incorporates feature decision and game plan, which is acted in the hidden center points of Spark building. The proposed improvement estimation is named Rider Chaotic Biography smoothing out (RCBO) computation, which is the joining of the Rider Optimization Algorithm (ROA) and the standard confounded biogeography-based-progression (CBBO). The proposed RCBO-significant stacked auto-encoder using Spark structure effectively handles the huge data for accomplishing incredible colossal data course of action. Here, the proposed RCBO is used for picking sensible features from the colossal dataset.", "venue": "2020 Fourth International Conference on I-SMAC (IoT in Social, Mobile, Analytics and Cloud) (I-SMAC)", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2020-10-07", "journal": {"name": "2020 Fourth International Conference on I-SMAC (IoT in Social, Mobile, Analytics and Cloud) (I-SMAC)", "pages": "851-854"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2285422478", "name": "Mr. Anilkumar"}, {"authorId": "2285625438", "name": "Vishwanath Brahmane"}, {"authorId": "2285504734", "name": "Dr. B.
