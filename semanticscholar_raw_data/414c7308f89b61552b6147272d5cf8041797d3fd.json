Apache Spark is one of the most active big-data approaches, with more and more systems adopting it, for efficient querying over distributed data. However, most of the Spark-based RDF query answering approaches so far, are exploiting simplistic horizontal and/or vertical partitioning of triples, resulting in poor query performance. The main reason for this is that simplistic data partitioning approaches fail to identify data locality and group together data that are usually queried together. To mitigate this problem, in this thesis, we present LAWA, a novel platform that accepts as input an RDF dataset and effectively partitions data, ensuring data locality. To achieve this, we identify the dataset\u2019s important nodes as centroids and then we distribute the other nodes to the centroid they mostly depend on. This scheme ensures data locality, and in most cases results in a balanced data distribution, however, without offering any guarantees on it. In order to study the design choices and isolate the impact of data locality and data distribution we introduce two variants. One focusing purely only on data locality, i.e. the Locality Aware Partitioning (LAP) approach and another one enforcing balanced data distribution as well, i.e. the Bounded Locality Aware Partitioning (BLAP) approach. We show that out approach offers an optimal fine tuning between data distribution, replication and data reduction, dominating existing approaches. More specifically we evaluate our approach using both synthetic and real workloads, showing that we improve query answering orders of magnitude over existing state of the art. \u039a\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 \u03b4\u03b5\u03b4\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd RDF \u03bc\u03b5 \u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c0\u03cc \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03b1\u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7 \u03b5\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03ae\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03bd \u03b5\u03ba\u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u03c0\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03b4\u03b5\u03b4\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd.", "venue": "", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2167808020", "name": "Ioannis Agathangelos"}], "citations": []}
