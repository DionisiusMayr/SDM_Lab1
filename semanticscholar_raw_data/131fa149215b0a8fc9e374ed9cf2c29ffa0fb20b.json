Draconis challenges the popular belief that programmable switches cannot house the complex data structures, such as queues, needed to support an in-network scheduler. Using programmable switches, Draconis achieves the low scheduling tail latency and high throughput needed to support these microsecond-scale workloads on large clusters. Furthermore, Draconis supports a wide range of complex scheduling policies, including locality-aware scheduling, priority-based scheduling, and resource-based scheduling. Draconis reduces the 99 th percentile scheduling latencies by 3 \u00d7 \u2013200 \u00d7 when compared to state-of-the-art software-based and network-accelerated schedulers, on a range of synthetic workloads. Our evaluation also demonstrates that Dra-conis has 52 \u00d7 higher throughput than server-based scheduling systems.", "venue": "", "year": null, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2028897029", "name": "Sreeharsha Udayashankar"}, {"authorId": "2028897121", "name": "Ashraf Abdel-hadi"}], "citations": []}
