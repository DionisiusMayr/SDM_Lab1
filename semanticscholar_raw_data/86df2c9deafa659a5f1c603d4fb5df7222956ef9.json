With the intensive study of the big data platform we find out various advantages and disadvantages of all big data platforms and get insight which platform is efficient of which type of task. The pros and cons of different platforms based on different metrics like fault tolerance, input output rate etc. This research proposed a dynamic adaptive scheduler APS (Adaptive Platform Scheduler) to select appropriate platform for specific task and we also discussed in detailed description of software that is which software is used with which hardware with its positive and negative points. With these important points, a user can take a decision that which platform will be the good one according to his requirements.", "venue": "IEEE International Conference on Recent Trends in Electronics, Information & Communication Technology", "year": 2016, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2016-05-01", "journal": {"name": "2016 IEEE International Conference on Recent Trends in Electronics, Information & Communication Technology (RTEICT)", "pages": "2072-2076"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "145313153", "name": "Meenakshi Sharma"}, {"authorId": "145850057", "name": "V.
