The IoT-cloud-based systems facilitate remote monitoring and support for patients. However, in the existing area, much emphasis has not been given to making the healthcare systems green. So, in this paper, we present an integrated framework for green healthcare and use cutting-edge technology to make an interactive user interface. We have also ensured the system\u2019s scalability and performance ratio. This system interface has been designed and developed for patients and doctors, where patients can send their healthcare data using wearable sensors, and doctors can receive those data in real-time. For data identification and analysis, we have adopted Hierarchical Clustering Algorithms. Finally, we have come up with a solution for how to make the interactive healthcare experience better for everyone.", "venue": "IEEE Access", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "IEEE Access", "pages": "22266-22282", "volume": "11"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3309048", "name": "Md.
