In this paper, an arithmetic study has been carried out in order to measure a coef\ufb01cient related to both the average number of hops among nodes and the average number of links among devices for a range of typical network topologies \ufb01t for data centers. Such topologies are either tree-like or graph-like designs, where this coef\ufb01cient provides a balance between performance and simplicity, resulting in lower values in the coef\ufb01cient accounting for a better compromise between both factors in redundant architectures. The motivation of this contribution is to craft a coef\ufb01cient that is easy to calculate by applying simple arithmetic operations. This coef\ufb01cient can be seen as another tool to compare network topologies in data centers that could act as a tie-breaker so as to select a given design when other parameters offer contradictory results.", "venue": "", "year": null, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "24889005", "name": "S.
