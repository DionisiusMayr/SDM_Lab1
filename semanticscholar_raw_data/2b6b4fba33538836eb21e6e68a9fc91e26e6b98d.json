These semantic frameworks underlie implementation models that formally guarantee correctness of audit logs. Recently, one such implementation model has been proposed for concurrent systems. In this paper, we study the deployment of an instrumentation tool based on this implementation model, aiming at microservices-based applications that are built by Java Spring framework. This tool instruments these applications according to a given logging specification, described in JSON. A set of events in one or more microservices may necessitate the generation of log entries in a specific microservice. Instrumentation of an application enables different microservices of that application to concurrently generate audit logs.", "venue": "Annual International Computer Software and Applications Conference", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2021-07-01", "journal": {"name": "2021 IEEE 45th Annual Computers, Software, and Applications Conference (COMPSAC)", "pages": "1357-1362"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1403432558", "name": "Sepehr Amir-Mohammadian"}, {"authorId": "2407753", "name": "Afsoon Yousefi Zowj"}], "citations": []}
