At the same time, the adoption of other Open-Source technologies has been also increasing for years, such as classical MPP-based systems for Analytical workloads. Thus, the question of efficient and fast data integration between Apache Hadoop and other organizational data storage systems is highly important for enterprises, where business and decision makers need the minimum delay of big heterogeneous data exchange between Hadoop and other storages. In this paper, we compare different options for loading data from Apache Hadoop, representing the Data Lake of organization, into Open-Source MPP Greenplum database with the role of classical data warehouse for analytical workloads, and choose the best one. Also, we identify potential risks of using different data loading methods.", "venue": "2021 International Conference on Electrical, Computer and Energy Technologies (ICECET)", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2021-12-09", "journal": {"name": "2021 International Conference on Electrical, Computer and Energy Technologies (ICECET)", "pages": "1-6"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "72491713", "name": "A.
