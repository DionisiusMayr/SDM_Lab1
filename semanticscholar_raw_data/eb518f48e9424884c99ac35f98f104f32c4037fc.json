This is particularly relevant in the context of the Internet of Things and Edge computing where smart devices may need to reason over newly acquired knowledge represented as Datalog rules. Our solution is based on an adaptation of a stratification strategy applied to a dependency hypergraph whose nodes correspond to rule sets in a Datalog program. Our implementation supports recursive rules containing both negation and aggregation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system on real and synthetic data.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-12-22", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2312.14530"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2276217041", "name": "Weiqin Xu"}, {"authorId": "2276203565", "name": "Olivier Cur'e"}], "citations": []}
