However, in implementing these changes one of the major issues faced by the agri\u2010food researchers is the fragmentation of the \u201cassets\u201d to be exploited when performing research tasks, for example, data of interest are heterogeneous and scattered across several repositories, the tools modelers rely on are diverse and often make use of limited computing capacity, the publishing practices are various and rarely aim at making available the \u201cwhole story\u201d including datasets, processes, and results. This paper presents the AGINFRA PLUS endeavor to overcome these limitations by providing researchers in three designated communities with Virtual Research Environments facilitating the use of the \u201cassets\u201d of interest and promote collaboration.", "venue": "Concurrency and Computation", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-11-25", "journal": {"name": "Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience", "volume": "33"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2671645", "name": "M.
