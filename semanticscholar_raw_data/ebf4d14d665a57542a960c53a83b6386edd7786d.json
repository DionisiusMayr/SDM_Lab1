How to optimize such model is still an open problem. In this paper, the shortest circuit diameter algorithm is employed to minimize transaction costs and maximize benefits under the scenario that the transaction cost of buying and selling electricity between users is performed. This article proposes the shortest road algorithm of two types of optimizations to explore its appropriate application scenarios in the micro -grid power transaction system.", "venue": "2022 International Conference on Computing, Communication, Perception and Quantum Technology (CCPQT)", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-08-01", "journal": {"name": "2022 International Conference on Computing, Communication, Perception and Quantum Technology (CCPQT)", "pages": "147-150"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1628264588", "name": "Ziyu Zhou"}, {"authorId": "2118262372", "name": "Hong Wen"}], "citations": []}
