In recent years, a new computing paradigm, called data federation, has emerged to provide collaborative data analytics among several data owners who would like to share their data under privacy protections. This paradigm brings a new challenge to the $k$-dominant skyline query, where data is distributed among these owners and privacy leakages should be prevented during the query processing. Accordingly, we define the problem of federated $k$-dominant skyline query and show that existing solutions cannot be extended to answer this query with satisfactory efficiency. To improve the efficiency, we present an observation of a vector aggregation based re-formulation and design an efficient solution under differential privacy. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that our solution is notably faster than the state-of-the-arts.", "venue": "2023 5th International Conference on Data-driven Optimization of Complex Systems (DOCS)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-09-22", "journal": {"name": "2023 5th International Conference on Data-driven Optimization of Complex Systems (DOCS)", "pages": "1-8"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2263843752", "name": "Guoqing Cai"}, {"authorId": "114438759", "name": "Yexuan Shi"}, {"authorId": "2264375208", "name": "Hao Zhou"}, {"authorId": "2263830332", "name": "Nan Zhou"}, {"authorId": "2264293390", "name": "Manxue Guo"}, {"authorId": "2210992922", "name": "Zimeng Jia"}], "citations": []}
