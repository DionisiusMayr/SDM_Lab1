This study reviewed the evolution of the Construction 5.0 paradigm by defining its features and diverse nature. It introduced the architecture, model, and system of Construction 5.0 and its key enablers: Operator 5.0, Society 5.0, human-centricity, sustainability, and resilience. The study used the SEM method to evaluate the research model and investigate the causal relationships among the key enablers of the Construction 5.0 paradigm. Nine vital hypotheses were proposed and assessed comprehensively. The critical enablers\u2019 variables were measured to examine the constructs\u2019 reliability and validity. The key findings showed that Construction 5.0 prioritizes collaboration between humans and machines, merges cyberspace with physical space, and balances the three pillars of sustainability (economy, environment, and society), creating a relationship among Operator 5.0, Society 5.0, human-Ccentricity, sustainability, and resilience. The study also discussed the limitations and challenges and offered suggestions for future research. Overall, Construction 5.0 aims to achieve sustainable development and become a robust and resilient provider of prosperity in an industrial community of a shared future. The study expects to spark debate and promote pioneering research toward the Construction 5.0 paradigm.", "venue": "Sustainability", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-06-05", "journal": {"name": "Sustainability"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "51134045", "name": "I.
