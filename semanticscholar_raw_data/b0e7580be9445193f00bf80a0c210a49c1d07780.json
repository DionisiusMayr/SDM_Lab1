Data management practices are of importance throughout these processes, and special attention should be given to provenance aspects. Additionally, insu\ufffdcient knowledge about these processes can lead to validity risks and weaken the quality of the extracted data. The need to collect provenance data during the data life cycle is undisputed, but there is a great lack of clarity on the status. Our study examines the current provenance tracking practices throughout the data lifecycle within the MIRACUM consortium. We outline the current data management maturity status and present recommendations to enable a trustful dissemination and re-use of patient data.", "venue": "", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2135020741", "name": "Kerstin Gierend"}, {"authorId": "2068371711", "name": "F.
