However, human behavior analysis using the accelerometer and gyroscope data are typically grounded on supervised classification techniques, where models are showing sub-optimal performance for qualitative and quantitative features. Considering this factor, this paper proposes an efficient and reduce dimension feature extraction model for human activity recognition. In this feature extraction technique, the Enveloped Power Spectrum (EPS) is used for extracting impulse components of the signal using frequency domain analysis which is more robust and noise insensitive. The Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is used as dimensionality reduction procedure to extract the minimum number of discriminant features from envelop spectrum for human activity recognition (HAR). The extracted features are used for human activity recognition using Multi-class Support Vector Machine (MCSVM). The proposed model was evaluated by using two benchmark datasets, i.e., the UCI-HAR and DU-MD datasets. This model is compared with other state-of-the-art methods and the model is outperformed.", "venue": "Italian National Conference on Sensors", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-12-01", "journal": {"name": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "volume": "20"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "35726521", "name": "R.
