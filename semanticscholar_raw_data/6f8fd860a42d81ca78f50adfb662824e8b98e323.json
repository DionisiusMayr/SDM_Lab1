As AI models scale, the requirement for high-bandwidth and low-latency networking compounds. The common use of electrical packet switching faces limitations due to optical-electrical-optical conversion bottlenecks. Optical switches, while bandwidth-agnostic and low-latency, suffer from having only unicast or non-scalable multicasting capability. This paper introduces an optical switching technique addressing this challenge. Our approach enables arbitrarily programmable simultaneous unicast and multicast connectivity, eliminating the need for optical splitters that hinder scalability due to optical power loss. We use phase modulation in multiple layers, tailored to implement any multicast connectivity map. Phase modulation also enables wavelength selectivity on top of spatial selectivity, resulting in an optical switch that implements space-wavelength routing. We conducted simulations and experiments to validate our approach. Our results affirm the concept's feasibility, effectiveness, and scalability, as a multicasting switch by experimentally demonstrating 16 spatial ports using 2 wavelength channels. Numerically, 64 spatial ports with 4 wavelength channels each were simulated, with approximately constant efficiency (<3 dB) as ports and wavelength channels scale.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Physics"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-01-25", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2401.14173"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1914942719", "name": "Niyazi Ula\u015f Din\u00e7"}, {"authorId": "2054293300", "name": "Mustafa Yildirim"}, {"authorId": "2263195123", "name": "Christophe Moser"}, {"authorId": "1784553", "name": "D.
