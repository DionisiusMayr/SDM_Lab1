Recently, it has been shown that voice signal data of the respiratory system (i.e., breathing, coughing, and speech) can be processed through machine learning techniques to detect different diseases of this system such as COVID-19, considered an ongoing global pandemic. Therefore, this paper presents a new IoT framework for the identification of COVID-19 based on breathing voice samples. Using IoT devices, voice samples were captured and transmitted to the cloud, where they were analyzed and processed using machine learning techniques such as the na\u00efve Bayes (NB) algorithm. In addition, the performance of the NB algorithm was assessed based on accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, F-Measure, and G-Mean. The experimental findings showed that the proposed NB algorithm achieved 82.97% accuracy, 75.86% sensitivity, 94.44% specificity, 95.65% precision, 84.61% F-Measure, and 84.64% G-Mean.", "venue": "The Scientist", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-12-23", "journal": {"name": "Sci"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1410092827", "name": "A.
