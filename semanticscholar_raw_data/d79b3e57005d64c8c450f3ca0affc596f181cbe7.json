This was the first time a strong earthquake hit the heritage site in China, making it an important area for ecological geological environment protection and restoration research. To understand the influence of slope runoff erosion on the activation of landslide accumulations, this study examined remote sensing images from 2017 to 2020 to investigate the geological disaster, while field scour tests were conducted to study the rainfall seepage, mass erosion, and migration.The results indicated that the steep-sloped landslide deposits in the heritage site contain a high content of fine grains and good permeability.", "venue": "Frontiers in Earth Science", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-08-07", "journal": {"name": "Frontiers in Earth Science"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "98609543", "name": "X.
