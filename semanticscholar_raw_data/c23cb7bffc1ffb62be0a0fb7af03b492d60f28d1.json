This paradigm plays a pivotal role in the world of the Internet of Things (IoT). Moreover, the concept of the distributed edge cloud raises several interesting open issues, e.g., failure recovery and security. In this paper, we propose a system composed of edge nodes and multiple cloud instances, as well as a voting mechanism. The multi-cloud environment aims to perform centralized computations, and edge nodes behave as a middle layer between edge devices and the cloud. Moreover, we present a voting mechanism that leverages the edge network to validate the performed computation that occurred in the centralized environment.", "venue": "Future Internet", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2019-12-15", "journal": {"name": "Future Internet", "pages": "262", "volume": "11"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "46185322", "name": "P.
