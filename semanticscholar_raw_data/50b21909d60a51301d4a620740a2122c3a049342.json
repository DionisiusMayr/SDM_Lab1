The algorithm models by the events of the thieves trying to catch Ali Baba, who learned the location of their treasure stores, and Ali Baba's assistant Marjaneh trying to mislead the thieves. As a result of the comparisons made under different conditions, it was seen that the multi-objective Ali Baba and the forty thieves algorithm gives the most successful results compared to the some other multi-objective intelligent optimization algorithms.", "venue": "International Scientific Conference on Information, Communication and Energy Systems and Technologies", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-06-29", "journal": {"name": "2023 58th International Scientific Conference on Information, Communication and Energy Systems and Technologies (ICEST)", "pages": "127-130"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "30891120", "name": "B.
