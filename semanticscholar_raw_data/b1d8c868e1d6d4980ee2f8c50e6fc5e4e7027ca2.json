We hypothesize that a multi-task model that trains on character dialogue plus character relationship information improves transformer-based story continuation. To this end, we extend the Critical Role Dungeons and Dragons Dataset (Rameshkumar and Bailey, 2020)\u2014consisting of dialogue transcripts of people collaboratively telling a story while playing the role-playing game Dungeons and Dragons\u2014with automatically extracted relationships between each pair of interacting characters as well as their personas. A series of ablations lend evidence to our hypothesis, showing that our multi-task model using character relationships improves story continuation accuracy over strong baselines.", "venue": "SIGDIAL Conferences", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-05-31", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2105.15054"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "152258340", "name": "Waiman Si"}, {"authorId": "19179135", "name": "Prithviraj Ammanabrolu"}, {"authorId": "2757194", "name": "Mark O.
