This review delves into various techniques that organizations employ to optimize their operations and achieve competitive advantages. At the forefront of strategic decision-making is data analytics, where vast amounts of data are analyzed to extract valuable insights. Descriptive analytics provides a historical perspective by examining past data trends, enabling businesses to understand their performance over time. This retrospective analysis serves as a foundation for predictive analytics, which utilizes statistical models and machine learning algorithms to forecast future trends and outcomes. By leveraging predictive analytics, organizations can anticipate market shifts, customer preferences, and potential risks, thereby making informed decisions. Prescriptive analytics uses predictive models to guide strategic decision-making, utilizing optimization algorithms and simulation tools to identify optimal actions. Decision science integrates analytical techniques with human judgment, focusing on consumer behavior and psychological factors to tailor marketing strategies and product offerings. Additionally, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies are revolutionizing strategic decision-making by automating complex tasks and providing real-time insights. Natural language processing (NLP) algorithms analyze unstructured data sources, such as customer reviews and social media posts, to extract valuable information and sentiment analysis. This enables businesses to gauge customer satisfaction levels and identify areas for improvement promptly. Decision trees, regression analysis, and clustering techniques are widely used in business analytics to segment customers, identify patterns, forecast sales trends, evaluate alternatives, assess risks, and optimize resource allocation. In conclusion, business analytics and decision science offer a plethora of techniques that empower organizations to make informed, data-driven decisions. By leveraging descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics, along with AI and ML technologies, businesses can navigate complex environments, capitalize on opportunities, and mitigate risks effectively. This review underscores the importance of integrating analytical techniques with human expertise to achieve strategic objectives and sustainable growth.", "venue": "World Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2024-02-28", "journal": {"name": "World Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2254384745", "name": "Andrew Ifesinachi Daraojimba"}, {"authorId": "2288302356", "name": "Chidera Victoria"}, {"authorId": "2288299042", "name": "Ibeh"}, {"authorId": "2288290525", "name": "Onyeka Franca Asuzu"}, {"authorId": "2282309771", "name": "Temidayo Olorunsogo"}, {"authorId": "2287955259", "name": "Oluwafunmi Adijat Elufioye"}, {"authorId": "2288321846", "name": "Ndubuisi Leonard Nduubuisi"}], "citations": []}
