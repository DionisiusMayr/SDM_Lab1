We hereby report virologic outcomes and patterns of acquired DRMs and its associated factors among adolescents and young adults (AYA) from a broader HIV drug resistance surveillance conducted in Tanzania. Methods Data of AYA was extracted from a cross-sectional study conducted in 36 selected facilities using a two-stage cluster sampling design. Dried blood spot (DBS) samples were collected and samples with a viral load (VL) \u22651000 copies/mL underwent genotyping for the HIV-1 pol gene. Stanford HIV database algorithm predicted acquired DRMs, Fisher\u2019s exact test and multivariable logistic regression assessed factors associated with DRMs and VS, respectively. Findings We analyzed data of 578 AYA on antiretroviral therapy (ART) for 9\u201315 and \u2265 36 months; among them, 91.5% and 88.2% had VS (VL<1000copies/mL) at early and late time points, respectively. Genotyping of 64 participants (11.2%) who had VL \u22651000 copies/ml detected 71.9% of any DRM. Clinically relevant DRMs were K103N, M184V, M41L, T215Y/F, L210W/L, K70R, D67N, L89V/T, G118R, E138K, T66A, T97A and unexpectedly absent K65R. Participants on a protease inhibitor (PI) based regimen were twice as likely to not achieve VS compared to those on integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTI). The initial VL done 6 months after ART initiation of \u22651000copies/mL was the primary factor associated with detecting DRMs (p = .019). Conclusions VS amongst AYA is lower than the third UNAIDs target. Additionally, a high prevalence of ADR and high levels of circulating clinically relevant DRMs may compromise the long-term VS in AYA. Furthermore, the first VL result of \u22651000copies/ml after ART initiation is a significant risk factor for developing DRMs. Thus, strict VL monitoring for early identification of treatment failure and genotypic testing during any ART switch is recommended to improve treatment outcomes for AYA.", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-02-23", "journal": {"name": "PLOS ONE", "volume": "18"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "5158779", "name": "J.
