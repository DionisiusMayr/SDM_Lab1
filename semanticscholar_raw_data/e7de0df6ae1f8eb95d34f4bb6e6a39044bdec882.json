To illustrate that categorizing players based on preferences for single-player vs. multiplayer games may be problematic, we analysed millions of posts in Reddit for single-player and multiplayer games to see which players use more extroversion (pro-social) words, citing research suggesting that those who prefer multiplayer games should use more extroversion words. We found no noticeable differences between the two groups, although unexpectedly single-player gamers did use more extroversion words in a statistically significant manner. Ultimately, we offer caution that categorization of games and gamers \u2013 although useful at times \u2013 can oversimplify assumed preferences and, when not critically examined, may lead to the reification of misleading and exclusionary categories of both games and the people who play them.", "venue": "Journal of Gaming &amp; Virtual Worlds", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-10-01", "journal": {"name": "Journal of Gaming &amp; Virtual Worlds"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2277611595", "name": "Kelly Bergstrom"}, {"authorId": "2277611571", "name": "Nathaniel D.
