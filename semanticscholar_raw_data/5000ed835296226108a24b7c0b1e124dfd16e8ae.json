Individual observations within these streams are multidimensional, with each dimension corresponding to a feature of interest. We consider time\u2010series geospatial datasets generated by remote and in situ observational devices. Three aspects make this problem particularly challenging: (1) the cumulative volume and rates of data arrivals, (2) evolution of the datasets over time, and (3) spatiotemporal correlations associated with the data. Further, solutions must minimize user intervention and be amenable to distributed processing to ensure scalability.", "venue": "Concurrency and Computation", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2017-06-25", "journal": {"name": "Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience", "volume": "29"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2930999", "name": "Walid Budgaga"}, {"authorId": "2528759", "name": "Matthew Malensek"}, {"authorId": "145069202", "name": "S.
