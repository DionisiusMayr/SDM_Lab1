The classical computing style is not much effective for such mission-critical data analysis and processing. Therefore, cloud computing is become popular for addressing and dealing with data. Cloud computing involves a large computational and network infrastructure that requires a significant amount of power and generates carbon footprints (CO2). In this context, we can minimize the cloud's energy consumption by controlling and switching off ideal machines. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a proactive virtual machine (VM) scheduling technique that can deal with frequent migration of VMs and minimize the energy consumption of the cloud using unsupervised learning techniques. The main objective of the proposed work is to reduce the energy consumption of cloud datacenters through effective utilization of cloud resources by predicting the future demand of resources. In this context four different clustering algorithms, namely K-Means, SOM (Self Organizing Map), FCM (Fuzzy C Means), and K-Mediod are used to develop the proposed proactive VM scheduling and find which type of clustering algorithm is best suitable for reducing the energy uses through proactive VM scheduling. This predictive load-aware VM scheduling technique is evaluated and simulated using the Cloud-Sim simulator. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheduling technique, the workload trace of 29 days released by Google in 2019 is used. The experimental outcomes are summarized in different performance matrices, such as the energy consumed and the average processing time. Finally, by concluding the efforts made, we also suggest future research directions.
