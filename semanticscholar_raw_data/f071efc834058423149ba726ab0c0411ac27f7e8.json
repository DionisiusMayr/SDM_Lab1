Summaries are widely used across the area of data management, and are studied from both theoretical and practical perspectives. They are the subject of ongoing research to improve their performance and broaden their applicability. In this column, recent developments in data summarization are surveyed, with the intent of inspiring further advances.", "venue": "SIGMOD record", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-01-31", "journal": {"name": "ACM SIGMOD Record", "pages": "6 - 15", "volume": "50"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1709589", "name": "Graham Cormode"}, {"authorId": "2149781051", "name": "AI Meta"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "42bdd649223a44d468923ce47907ef1e710b0bad", "title": "Elastic Data Binning: Time-Series Sketching for Time-Domain Astrophysics Analysis"}, {"paperId": "19ec4d07335fec473b4b4c794c3a6e2931a2a05d", "title": "Elastic Data Binning: Time-Series Sketching for Time-Domain Astrophysics Analysis"}, {"paperId": "e6d5b92f8ccb98508fef49f1b94df6c0b62173f0", "title": "Elastic Data Binning for Transient Pattern Analysis in Time-Domain Astrophysics"}, {"paperId": "0a19d07533622bb1dfb11827a6a2153c73e586eb", "title": "Differentially Private Linear Sketches: Efficient Implementations and Applications"}]}
