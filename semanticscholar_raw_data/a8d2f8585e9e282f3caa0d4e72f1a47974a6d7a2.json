A suitable thermal comfort must monitor and balance complex factors from heating, ventilation, air-conditioning systems (HVAC Systems) and outdoor and indoor environments based on advanced technology. It needs engineers and technicians to observe relevant factors on a physical site and to detect problems using their experience to fix them early and prevent them from worsening. However, it is a labor-intensive and time-consuming task, while experts are short on diagnosing and producing proactive plans and actions. This research addresses the limitations by proposing a new Internet of Things (IoT)-driven fault detection system for indoor thermal comfort. We focus on the well-known problem caused by an HVAC system that cannot transfer heat from the indoor to outdoor and needs engineers to diagnose such concerns. The IoT device is developed to observe perceptual information from the physical site as a system input. The prior knowledge from existing research and experts is encoded to help systems detect problems in the manner of human-like intelligence. Three standard categories of machine learning (ML) based on geometry, probability, and logical expression are applied to the system for learning HVAC system problems. The results report that the MLs could improve overall performance based on prior knowledge around 10% compared to perceptual information. Well-designed IoT devices with prior knowledge reduced false positives and false negatives in the predictive process that aids the system to reach satisfactory performance.", "venue": "Italian National Conference on Sensors", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-03-01", "journal": {"name": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "volume": "22"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "40372233", "name": "Bukhoree Sahoh"}, {"authorId": "119188001", "name": "Mallika Kliangkhlao"}, {"authorId": "2999941", "name": "N.
