IoHT refers to the interconnected network of devices, sensors, and systems used in the healthcare industry to monitor and manage patient health. While IoHT has the potential to revolutionize healthcare, it is also vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks. DNS (Domain Name System) traffic monitoring in IoHT (Internet of Health Things) provide valuable insights into the communication patterns and behaviours of the various IoT devices and systems within a healthcare network. We have explored some of the common attacks on IoHT networks and their impact on healthcare. Then performed comparative analysis of various DNS traffic monitoring techniques and proposed the best possible solutions to protect IoHT applications.", "venue": "2023 International Conference on Recent Advances in Electrical, Electronics & Digital Healthcare Technologies (REEDCON)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-05-01", "journal": {"name": "2023 International Conference on Recent Advances in Electrical, Electronics & Digital Healthcare Technologies (REEDCON)", "pages": "89-94"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2220165842", "name": "Mehwash Weqar"}, {"authorId": "2734337", "name": "S.
