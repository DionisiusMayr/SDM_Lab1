We present a residual generating FDD approach combining multilayer perceptron networks trained with historical data and Bayesian optimisation for hyperparameter tuning. A comprehensive engineering process has been developed, which is highly automated and applicable by non-machine learning experts. We demonstrate the transferability using datasets from twelve different air handling units and provide an estimation of fault-free behaviour. Applied on a synthetic data set, the approach shows comparably results to a rule-based fault detection, with the advantages of less threshold tuning, detecting unknown faults, and facilitating fault diagnosis based on residuals.", "venue": "Building Simulation Conference Proceedings", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-09-04", "journal": {"name": "Building Simulation Conference Proceedings"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2290853198", "name": "Sebastian Dietz"}, {"authorId": "2290805027", "name": "Frank Scholzen"}, {"authorId": "2290846085", "name": "Nicolas R\u00e9hault"}, {"authorId": "2290846019", "name": "C\u00e9dric Dockendorf"}], "citations": []}
