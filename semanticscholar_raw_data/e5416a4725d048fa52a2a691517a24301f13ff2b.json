Digital Twins are virtual replicas of physical assets that facilitate operational efficiency and data-driven decision-making at the heart of this transformation.. The Asset Administration Shell acts as a Digital Twin for physical and virtual assets, ensuring interoperability and improved management throughout the asset's lifecycle. Communication protocols like Message Queuing Telemetry Transport, Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture, and Constrained Application Protocol are integral to the interpretability goal, enabling reliable data transmission in digital twin systems. This paper delves into the significance of datagrams and communication protocols in Digital Twins, exploring their applications, benefits, and selection criteria for the appropriate protocols. Furthermore, the paper highlights successful implementations of the Asset Administration Shell and provides case studies from various industries. By filling research gaps and providing recommendations, this paper aims to contribute to deploying and understanding digital twins in industrial settings.", "venue": "2023 International Conference on Electrical, Computer and Energy Technologies (ICECET)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-11-16", "journal": {"name": "2023 International Conference on Electrical, Computer and Energy Technologies (ICECET)", "pages": "1-6"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2280409754", "name": "Alfred Barnard"}, {"authorId": "2280675747", "name": "Melanie Stolze"}], "citations": []}
