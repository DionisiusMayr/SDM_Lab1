Furthermore, these rules do not run in isolation, which exposes opportunities for reuse of partial evaluation results across rules. In our work on Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer, and its underlying rule-authoring toolkit known as the Guru Query Language (GQL), we have encountered performance and scalability challenges, and identified corresponding optimization opportunities such as, caching, indexing, and customization of analysis scope, which rule authors can take advantage of as built-in GQL constructs. Our experimental evaluation on a dataset of open-source GitHub repositories shows 3X speedup and perfect recall using indexing-based configurations, and 2X speedup and 51% increase on the number of findings for caching-based optimization.", "venue": "SOAP@PLDI", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-06-06", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 12th ACM SIGPLAN International Workshop on the State Of the Art in Program Analysis"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1697640", "name": "B.
