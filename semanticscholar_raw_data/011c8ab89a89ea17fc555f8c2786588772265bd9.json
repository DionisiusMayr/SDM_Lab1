In this paper, we introduce a novel design methodology based on a distributed approach, which aims at automatically partitioning the execution of a NN over multiple heterogeneous tiny devices. Such a methodology is formalized as an optimization problem where either the inference latency is minimized or the throughput is maximized, within the devices\u2019 memory and computing capabilities. The methodology is evaluated over several NN architectures and microcontrollers (MCUs) by using three algorithms, namely Full Search (FS), Dichotomic Search (DS) and Branch-and-Bound (B&B). The obtained results showed that the B&B outperformed the others since, in all the experiments, it was able to find the optimal solution in the lowest number of computing steps. With this work, we aim at enabling novel Machine Learning (ML) solutions which offer low latency, autonomy and high energy efficiency.", "venue": "2022 IEEE 21st Mediterranean Electrotechnical Conference (MELECON)", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-06-14", "journal": {"name": "2022 IEEE 21st Mediterranean Electrotechnical Conference (MELECON)", "pages": "984-989"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1486403840", "name": "Biagio Montaruli"}, {"authorId": "2159457411", "name": "Andrea Santamaria"}, {"authorId": "46814779", "name": "D.
