The bandwidth under consideration may be either in an unlicensed spectrum or in an unused licensed band. Spectrum sharing is achieved via a mechanism in which a cognitive radio acting as the auctioneer advertises spectrum availability to bidding cognitive radios and defines a puzzle to solve as a method to access it. The cognitive radios act as bidders by computing the solution to the problem (i.e., the \u201cpuzzle\u201d). The winner is the bidder who submits the first correct bid and thus gains access to the spectrum for the next time interval. We consider two different variances of our scheme based on parallelizable and non-parallelizable problems and demonstrate that the latter provides a fair auction in contrast to the former. We propose a verification database to counter malicious \u201cgreedy\u201d players. Our algorithm provides a centralized, easy-to-implement, and computationally fast multiple-access scheme that is verifiable by all participating cognitive radios.", "venue": "IEEE International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications", "year": 2016, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2016-10-01", "journal": {"name": "2016 IEEE 12th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)", "pages": "1-6"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2563579", "name": "K.
