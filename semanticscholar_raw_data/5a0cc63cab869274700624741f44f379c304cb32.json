Learning processes in education are difficult to establish. However, the employment of these new approaches from the Artificial Intelligence (AI) can contribute to support the learning measuring. Identify the knowledge acquired during a course is important to determine the achievement of the objectives and to develop strategies to improve the course. In this paper is presented the employment of NLP tools for determining differences in conceptualization between beginning and ending of processes for a bioinformatics course inside of a biomedical engineering program. Results established that there are differences in the conceptualization of the students in a first sight of the bioinformatics course and the end of academic period.", "venue": "IEEE ANDESCON", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-11-16", "journal": {"name": "2022 IEEE ANDESCON", "pages": "1-5"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2198498821", "name": "Andr\u00e9s F.
