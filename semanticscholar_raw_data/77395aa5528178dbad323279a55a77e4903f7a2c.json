ATSC systems demand the ability to strictly reflect real-time traffic state. The proposed fog computing framework, namely FogFly, aligns with this requirement by its natures in location-awareness, low latency and affordability to the changes in traffic conditions. As traffic data is updated timely and processed at fog nodes deployed close to data sources (i.e., vehicles at intersections) traffic light cycles can be optimized efficiently while virtualized resources available at network edges are efficiently utilized. Evaluation results show that services running in FogFly produce better performance comparing to those in cloud computing approaches.", "venue": "UbiComp/ISWC Adjunct", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book"], "publicationDate": "2018-10-08", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 2018 ACM International Joint Conference and 2018 International Symposium on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing and Wearable Computers"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1679045", "name": "Q.
