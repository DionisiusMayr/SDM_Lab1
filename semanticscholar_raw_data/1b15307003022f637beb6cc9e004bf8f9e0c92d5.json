Our systematic analysis in this work shows that existing on-path SmartNICs have resource multiplexing limitations. For example, existing solutions lack multi-tenancy capabilities such as performance isolation and QoS provisioning for compute and IO resources. Compared to standard NIC data paths with a well-defined set of offloaded functions, unpredictable execution times of SmartNIC kernels make conventional approaches for multi-tenancy and QoS insufficient. We fill this gap with OSMOSIS, a SmartNICs resource manager co-design. OSMOSIS extends existing OS mechanisms to enable dynamic hardware resource multiplexing of the on-path packet processing data plane. We integrate OSMOSIS within an open-source RISC-V-based 400Gbit/s SmartNIC. Our performance results demonstrate that OSMOSIS fully supports multi-tenancy and enables broader adoption of SmartNICs in datacenters with low overhead.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Engineering"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-09-07", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2309.03628"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2238206001", "name": "Mikhail Khalilov"}, {"authorId": "2238206038", "name": "Marcin Chrapek"}, {"authorId": "1712248670", "name": "Siyuan Shen"}, {"authorId": "2238205943", "name": "Alessandro Vezzu"}, {"authorId": "143673573", "name": "Thomas Emanuel Benz"}, {"authorId": "32042628", "name": "S.
