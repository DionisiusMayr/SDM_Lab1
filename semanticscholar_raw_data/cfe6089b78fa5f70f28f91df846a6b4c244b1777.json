Big data analytics in the manufacturing industry is mainly used to process massive data in various manufacturing activities. Today, many industrial companies are starting discussions on the importance of DSS (Decision Support Systems) and its cloud processing capability. In recent years different approaches have been developed to provide appropriate solutions for big data and DSS. In this work, we will carry out detailed bibliographical research on the methods and applications of big data for decision making and provide a classification for them. Even if this bibliographic review does not call on all the studies carried out in this field, we believe that it can constitute a valuable source of information, particularly for practitioners in big data and Intelligent Decision-Making.", "venue": "International Conference on Signal-Image Technology and Internet-Based Systems", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-10-01", "journal": {"name": "2022 16th International Conference on Signal-Image Technology & Internet-Based Systems (SITIS)", "pages": "i-viii"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2214167150", "name": "Bakass Assiya"}, {"authorId": "3348585", "name": "T.
