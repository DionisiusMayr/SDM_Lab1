Since these frameworks\u2019 design was primarily motivated by performance and usability, most were assumed to operate in non-malicious settings. Hence, they allow users to execute arbitrary code to analyze the data. To make the situation worse, they do not support \ufb01ne-grained access control inherently or offer any plugin mechanism to enable it \u2013 which makes them risky to be used in multi-tier organizational settings. There have been attempts to build \u201cadd-on\u201d solutions to enable \ufb01ne-grained access control for distributed data analytics platforms. In this paper, we show that by knowing the nature of the solution, an attacker can evade the access control by maliciously using the platform-provided APIs. Speci\ufb01cally, we crafted several attack vectors to evade such solutions. Next, we systematically analyze the threats and potentially risky APIs and propose a two-layered (i.e., proactive and reactive ) defense to protect against those attacks. Our proactive security layer utilizes state-of-the-art program analysis to detect potentially malicious user code. The reactive security layer consists of binary integrity checking, instrumentation-based runtime checks, and sandboxed execution. Finally, Using this solution, we provide a secure implementation of a new framework-agnostic \ufb01ne-grained attribute-based access control framework named S ECURE DL for Apache Spark. To the best of our knowledge, this is the \ufb01rst work that provides secure \ufb01ne-grained attribute-based access control distributed data analytics platforms that allow arbitrary code execution. Performance evaluation showed that the overhead due to added security is low", "venue": "", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "3398057", "name": "Fahad Shaon"}, {"authorId": "40242722", "name": "Sazzadur Rahaman"}, {"authorId": "2269048681", "name": "Murat Kantarcioglu"}], "citations": []}
