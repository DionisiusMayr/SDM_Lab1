Mobile services can be processed for the sake of obtaining a good service experience and reduce the network load of the backtrip network. In order to effectively improve the end-to-end service delay of the \ufb02ow in multi-clusters coexisting mobile edge computing (MEC) network, an improved virtual network function (VNF) service chain deployment algorithm based on Q-learning was proposed. Based on the planning model, a spatial-temporal optimization model of VNF service chain deployment was established by markov decision process, and an improved BPQ-learning algorithm was designed to solve the model. The method considered both the virtual deployment of MEC service chain in space dimension and the life cycle management of VNF in time dimension. The optimization of VNF deployment is realized. The possible network congestion is avoided by deployment service nodes in advance. Experimental results show that the proposed strategy can provide end-to-end services with lower latency and better experience for delay-sensitive mobile services under different VNF service chain scale, service node scale, cluster number and logical connection relationship among the virtual network functions.", "venue": "", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2192547", "name": "Hejun Xuan"}, {"authorId": "2151166086", "name": "Jun Lu"}, {"authorId": "2157951236", "name": "Na Li"}, {"authorId": "2108527006", "name": "Leijie Wang"}], "citations": []}
