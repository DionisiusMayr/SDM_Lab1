Turning our cities towards transit\u2010oriented development might help in reducing pollut\u2010 ant emissions caused by individual transportation modes that rely on crude oil. This research presents how the use of geospatial network analysis can support local decision makers in the evaluation of potential public transport accessibil\u2010 ity by citizens in the case of a Central European city \u2013 Wroc\u0142aw (Poland). The obtained results indicate differentiation in access to railway stations and stops, which results from pedestrian path networks and the number of entrances to railway stations. The visualization of serve area shows which parts of the city are excluded from comfortable access to public transport and in that way high\u2010 light where future actions should be taken.", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2021-04-27", "journal": {"name": "Geomatics and Environmental Engineering", "pages": "39-53", "volume": "15"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2106032971", "name": "Maksymilian Le\u015bniewski"}, {"authorId": "51351658", "name": "M. \u015awi\u0105der"}, {"authorId": "26955412", "name": "I.
