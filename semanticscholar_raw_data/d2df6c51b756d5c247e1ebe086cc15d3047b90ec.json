Products are sold one at a time, and only a binary response indicating the success or failure of a sale is observed. Our model setting is similar to \\cite{JN19} except that we expand the demand curve to a semiparametric model and need to learn dynamically both parametric and nonparametric components. We propose a dynamic statistical learning and decision-making policy that combines semiparametric estimation from a generalized linear model with an unknown link and online decision making to minimize regret (maximize revenue). Under mild conditions, we show that for a market noise c.d.f. $F(\\cdot)$ with $m$-th order derivative, our policy achieves a regret upper bound of $\\tilde{\\cO}_{d}(T^{\\frac{2m+1}{4m-1}})$ for $m\\geq 2$, where $T$ is time horizon and $\\tilde{\\cO}_{d}$ is the order that hides logarithmic terms and the dimensionality of feature $d$. The upper bound is further reduced to $\\tilde{\\cO}_{d}(\\sqrt{T})$ if $F$ is super smooth whose Fourier transform decays exponentially. In terms of dependence on the horizon $T$, these upper bounds are close to $\\Omega(\\sqrt{T})$, the lower bound where the market noise distribution belongs to a parametric class. We further generalize these results to the case when the product features are dynamically dependent, satisfying some strong mixing conditions.", "venue": "Social Science Research Network", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Economics", "Mathematics"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-09-13", "journal": {"name": "CompSciRN: Other Machine Learning (Topic)"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "144958605", "name": "Jianqing Fan"}, {"authorId": "32021074", "name": "Yongyi Guo"}, {"authorId": "1605759982", "name": "Mengxin Yu"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "4ac31c8490fffd83186365bc830fa6a86d49ee27", "title": "Pricing with Contextual Elasticity and Heteroscedastic Valuation"}, {"paperId": "8935eb24abb5d4864906e4cbeed566af6f863ec5", "title": "Exploring the sustainable growth pathway of wind power in China: Using the semiparametric regression model"}, {"paperId": "c226e1007436976abed4cadd4b2e5a4aae6813a7", "title": "Utility Fairness in Contextual Dynamic Pricing with Demand Learning"}, {"paperId": "a943983d43a282bd252340bb175bb1781b74256b", "title": "Smoothness-Adaptive Dynamic Pricing with Nonparametric Demand Learning"}, {"paperId": "8bf08c75458253c38726ff064cc1ae00293b98d7", "title": "Doubly High-Dimensional Contextual Bandits: An Interpretable Model for Joint Assortment-Pricing"}, {"paperId": "7fa790356cd0cecad4bb1efa71b8f71812b43ef6", "title": "Contextual Dynamic Pricing with Strategic Buyers"}, {"paperId": "9285951db582c7b58707bb335ddc125fb7a90f02", "title": "A Reinforcement Learning Approach in Multi-Phase Second-Price Auction Design"}, {"paperId": "c824fa59f3a58fe59964703ad8390fdef0291809", "title": "Theoretical guarantees for permutation-equivariant quantum neural networks"}, {"paperId": "d6b2b76e1c040a46a34c81d4fffc987aca79fbcb", "title": "Doubly Fair Dynamic Pricing"}, {"paperId": "1377daceb3edc2cd9ecedf43a03d82ba89cb1b41", "title": "COMBSS: best subset selection via continuous optimization"}, {"paperId": "a4e9f7972693cb4d873367a61218f822d46f0f4e", "title": "Towards Agnostic Feature-based Dynamic Pricing: Linear Policies vs Linear Valuation with Unknown Noise"}, {"paperId": "515584853f7bda29302a1261675b7f6eba90c2d1", "title": "Distribution-free Contextual Dynamic Pricing"}, {"paperId": "e11930d9cf97b75872a853d8fe2ca74c3c1477e8", "title": "Learning to Bid in Contextual First Price Auctions\u2731"}, {"paperId": "5b05fac7b9bd4b85651c28460e0a5590773c0bcb", "title": "Online Regularization towards Always-Valid High-Dimensional Dynamic Pricing"}, {"paperId": "9791bbd5f492fa628c018cc2fd827c73ffb37431", "title": "Incentive-aware Contextual Pricing with Non-parametric Market Noise"}, {"paperId": "0cff36a1ff49e48c89c7fe841556b0007aa38f1e", "title": "Pricing Experimental Design: Causal Effect, Expected Revenue and Tail Risk"}, {"paperId": "75b40ca9f97fa016bf0e100a49852896deb5c742", "title": "Semi-Parametric Contextual Pricing Algorithm using Cox Proportional Hazards Model"}]}
