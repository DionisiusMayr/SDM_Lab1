This landscape impacts query engines, as they need to be reworked to keep competitive performance by leveraging the underlying architectures. Such a rework might be costly if, for each external processor or SDK, peripheral components needed to be developed as well; resulting in redundant effort and adoption difficulties. In this paper, we propose an approach to overcome these shortcomings through ADAMANT \u2013 a query executor equipped with interfaces to plug-in new co-processors without reworking other components of a query engine. ADAMANT consists of 1) pluggable interfaces that allow interaction with co-processors, encapsulating operator implementations, and 2) a unified runtime that handles the execution on arbitrary co-processors, with a chunked execution model for scalable query processing. To evaluate ADAMANT\u2019s versatility, we plug different implementations of a CPU/GPU-based system (using OpenCL, OpenMP, & CUDA) and analyze their performance on TPC-H queries. We identify a 4x performance difference between an arbitrary chunked execution vs. a more architecturally conscious pipelined execution. Furthermore, our comparisons with HeavyDB show complex performance variations from speed-ups up to a factor of 2x from our hardware-conscious execution. We envision initiatives like ADAMANT to ease the study of complex optimizations required in co-processor systems, paving the way for efficient and portable data management tools without cutbacks.", "venue": "IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-04-01", "journal": {"name": "2023 IEEE 39th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE)", "pages": "1153-1166"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "31512739", "name": "B.
