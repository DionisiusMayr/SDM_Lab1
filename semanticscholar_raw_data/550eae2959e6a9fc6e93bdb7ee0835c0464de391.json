The VAWT we designed has a one-of-a-kind blade design that is positioned to form a scoop portion for capturing wind. Three sets of turbine blades are stacked around an axis, with each set having a 60-degree angle variation from the previous or subsequent set. As a result, when rotated, it seems to be a \u201cDNA helix.\u201d The scoop section of the blades is designed to allow for power generation at higher wind speeds. This is only feasible because of the furling gears that are attached between the blades and aid in furling the blades to reduce surface area of scoop section.", "venue": "2022 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communication and Applied Informatics (ACCAI)", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-01-28", "journal": {"name": "2022 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communication and Applied Informatics (ACCAI)", "pages": "1-4"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "31544107", "name": "V.
