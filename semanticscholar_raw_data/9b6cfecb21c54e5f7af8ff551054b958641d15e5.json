The disadvantage of not implementing e-commerce is certainly detrimental to the garden owner because they have to go through an agent so prices are set based on the agent. So with the application of e-commerce, buyers of crude palm oil can predict prices in conducting business processes to the future. So the need to forecasting the price of crude palm oil heads in order to improve the application of business intelligence using the evolution-based artificial neural network (ANN) method which in this paper is tested with SECoS get a MAPE value of 0.035% and by applying business intelligence can protect transaction costs by 33.3%.", "venue": "Bulletin of Electrical Engineering and Informatics", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2020-08-01", "journal": {"name": "Bulletin of Electrical Engineering and Informatics"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1644551924", "name": "A.
