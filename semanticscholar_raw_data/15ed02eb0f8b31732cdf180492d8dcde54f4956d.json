Some authors have proposed that BDA projects differ from IT projects by requiring extra analytical capabilities, special software, and more specialized application developers to enhance decision modelling effectiveness. This study used a two-respondent survey of decision makers using BDA applications fully operational for between 1-3 years and the corresponding CDOs in 282 organizations in various industry sectors. Using stepwise multivariate regression analysis, this convenience sample with a response rate of 32% was used to test hypotheses regarding the importance of some factors proposed in the literature as likely to improve the success of BDA applications. The results corroborate the importance of these factors by explaining a substantial percentage of the variance in decision modelling effectiveness and support several insights on a few success factors corporate managers should focus on.", "venue": "International Journal of Applied Logistics", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-01-01", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Applied Logistics"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1727077", "name": "T.
