Hippocampi, amygdalae and insulae were selected from the volumetric analysis of structured magnetic resonance images (MRIs). Three-view patches (TVPs) from these regions were fed to the CNN for training. MRIs were classified with the SoftMax-normalized scores of individual model predictions on TVPs. The significance of each region of interest (ROI) for staging the AD spectrum was evaluated and reported. The results of the ensemble classifier are compared with state-of-the-art methods using the same evaluation metrics. Patch-based ROI ensembles provide comparable diagnostic performance for AD staging. In this work, TVP-based ROI analysis using a CNN provides informative landmarks in cerebral MRIs and may have significance in clinical studies and computer-aided diagnosis system design.", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-12-08", "journal": {"name": "PLoS ONE", "volume": "15"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "26989625", "name": "Samsuddin Ahmed"}, {"authorId": "2118115012", "name": "Byeong C.
