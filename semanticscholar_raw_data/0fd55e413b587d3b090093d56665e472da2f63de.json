They are essential to data enrichment because they form the basis for detailed annotations that provide a more insightful and in-depth view of the underlying data. Keyword/domain driven term extraction is a pivotal task in natural language processing, facilitating information retrieval, document summarization, and content categorization. This review focuses on keyword extraction methods, emphasizing the use of three major Large Language Models(LLMs): Llama2-7B, GPT-3.5, and Falcon-7B. We employed a custom Python package to interface with these LLMs, simplifying keyword extraction. Our study, utilizing the Inspec and PubMed datasets, evaluates the performance of these models. The Jaccard similarity index was used for assessment, yielding scores of 0.64 (Inspec) and 0.21 (PubMed) for GPT-3.5, 0.40 and 0.17 for Llama2-7B, and 0.23 and 0.12 for Falcon-7B. This paper underlines the role of prompt engineering in LLMs for better keyword extraction and discusses the impact of hallucination in LLMs on result evaluation. It also sheds light on the challenges in using LLMs for keyword extraction, including model complexity, resource demands, and optimization techniques.", "venue": "", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2024-04-02", "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2279919938", "name": "Sandeep Chataut"}, {"authorId": "2131927760", "name": "Tuyen Do"}, {"authorId": "2199213494", "name": "Bichar Dip Shrestha Gurung"}, {"authorId": "2279926407", "name": "Shiva Aryal"}, {"authorId": "2279917526", "name": "Anup Khanal"}, {"authorId": "2241699269", "name": "Carol Lushbough"}, {"authorId": "1924993", "name": "Etienne Z.
