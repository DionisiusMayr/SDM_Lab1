Large data sets are challenging to handle as they grow quickly over time. Companies that manufacture assets or offer any physical services, including industrial automation, are experiencing a change in their operations. It has drastically changed in the modern day, especially compared to many industries that offer efficient assets to differentiate by offering digital services changes in industrial behavior, and an emphasis on automation using IoT devices along with server agents. The purpose of this paper is to run server-based data, which enables the easier scaling of device metrics performances and manages the IoT resources. In this study, the toolchain components influx DB, telegraf, and grafana are used along with the digital twin in a realistic edge server setup.", "venue": "2023 OITS International Conference on Information Technology (OCIT)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-12-13", "journal": {"name": "2023 OITS International Conference on Information Technology (OCIT)", "pages": "805-810"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2284808899", "name": "Shabnam"}, {"authorId": "1483732860", "name": "Manju Pandey"}], "citations": []}
