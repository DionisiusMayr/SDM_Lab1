In a BDS, malicious botnets are detected by white-hat botnets, and are deleted from an IoT system. In this paper, we propose a modeling method of the spread of malicious botnets in a BDS, where white-hat botnets patrol according to the computation result of surveillance by multiple agents. Using the graph structure of an IoT system and the paths of white-hat botnets, the spread of malicious botnets is modeled by a discrete-time Markov chain. A numerical example is presented to demonstrate the proposed method.", "venue": "IEEE/SICE International Symposium on System Integration", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-01-17", "journal": {"name": "2023 IEEE/SICE International Symposium on System Integration (SII)", "pages": "1-5"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "38490537", "name": "Koichi Kobayashi"}], "citations": []}
