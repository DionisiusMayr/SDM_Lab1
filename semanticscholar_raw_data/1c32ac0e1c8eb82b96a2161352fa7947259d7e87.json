This wastes CPU cycles upon re-running killed jobs and incentivizes datacenter operators to run at low memory utilization for safety. This paper introduces soft memory, a software-level abstraction on top of standard primary storage that, under memory pressure, makes memory revocable for re-allocation elsewhere. We prototype soft memory with the Redis key-value store, and find that it has low overhead.", "venue": "USENIX Workshop on Hot Topics in Operating Systems", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-06-22", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 19th Workshop on Hot Topics in Operating Systems"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2220401304", "name": "Megan Frisella"}, {"authorId": "2220400132", "name": "Shirley Loayza Sanchez"}, {"authorId": "1962485", "name": "Malte Schwarzkopf"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "58e3fb045afbb370aa613839f0523f00ef185844", "title": "Harvesting Idle Memory for Application-Managed Soft State with Midas"}]}
