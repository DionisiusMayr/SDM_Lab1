Consequently, the appropriate amount of memory to allocate to the cluster is a crucial consideration. In this paper, we analyze the challenge of efficient resource allocation for distributed data processing, focusing on memory. We emphasize that in-memory processing with in-memory data processing frameworks can undermine resource efficiency. Based on the findings of our trace data analysis, we compile requirements towards an automated solution for efficient cluster resource allocation.", "venue": "International Conference on Statistical and Scientific Database Management", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-06-06", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 35th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "153294591", "name": "Jonathan Will"}, {"authorId": "2294791", "name": "L.
