Moreover, it provides a means to access and examine the exchanged information among network users that would otherwise be inaccessible. To enhance network traffic analysis, the integration of innovative technologies that facilitate real-time querying and pattern matching proves indispensable. This research paper presents a system that exemplifies such advancements\u2014an innovative network traffic logging tool. The tool specifically focuses on performing real-time network packet transfer to Apache Kafka and ksqlDB, leveraging their capabilities to ensure swift and dependable storage of network packets in Apache Kafka topics. By showcasing this solution, the paper demonstrates the benefits and effectiveness of employing modern technologies for network traffic analysis and management.", "venue": "Italian National Conference on Sensors", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-07-01", "journal": {"name": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "volume": "23"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2145566282", "name": "Adrian-Tiberiu Costin"}, {"authorId": "30536156", "name": "Daniel Zinca"}, {"authorId": "1680160", "name": "V.
