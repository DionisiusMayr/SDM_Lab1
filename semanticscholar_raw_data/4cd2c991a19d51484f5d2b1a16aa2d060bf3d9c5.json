Therefore, it is of paramount importance to accurately detect malicious URLs. Prior research has explored the use of deep-learning models to identify malicious URLs, using the segmentation of URL strings into character-level or word-level tokens, and embedding and employing trained models to differentiate between URLs. In this study, a bidirectional encoder representation from a transformers-based (BERT) model was devised to tokenize URL strings, employing its self-attention mechanism to enhance the understanding of correlations among tokens. Subsequently, a classifier was employed to determine whether a given URL was malicious. In evaluating the proposed methods, three different types of public datasets were utilized: a dataset consisting solely of URL strings from Kaggle, a dataset containing only URL features from GitHub, and a dataset including both types of data from the University of New Brunswick, namely, ISCX 2016. The proposed system achieved accuracy rates of 98.78%, 96.71%, and 99.98% on the three datasets, respectively. Additionally, experiments were conducted on two datasets from different domains\u2014the Internet of Things (IoT) and Domain Name System over HTTPS (DoH)\u2014to demonstrate the versatility of the proposed model.", "venue": "Italian National Conference on Sensors", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-10-01", "journal": {"name": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "volume": "23"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2258974740", "name": "Ming-Yang Su"}, {"authorId": "2284074094", "name": "Kuan Lin Su"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "45cfe6fb648b97b8e4278902f6e4c63f932163b5", "title": "Context and Multi-Features-Based Vulnerability Detection: A Vulnerability Detection Frame Based on Context Slicing and Multi-Features"}, {"paperId": "16bc727d9537f79d989880a7a7786defb5bc7aeb", "title": "Malicious Website Detection Method Based on BGResNet Multi-feature Fusion"}]}
