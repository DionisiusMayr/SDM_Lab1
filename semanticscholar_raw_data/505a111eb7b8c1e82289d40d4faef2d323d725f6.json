FAX leverages JAX's sharding mechanisms to enable native targeting of TPUs and state-of-the-art JAX runtimes, including Pathways. FAX embeds building blocks for federated computations as primitives in JAX. This enables three key benefits. First, FAX computations can be translated to XLA HLO. Second, FAX provides a full implementation of federated automatic differentiation, greatly simplifying the expression of federated computations. Last, FAX computations can be interpreted out to existing production cross-device federated compute systems. We show that FAX provides an easily programmable, performant, and scalable framework for federated computations in the data center.
