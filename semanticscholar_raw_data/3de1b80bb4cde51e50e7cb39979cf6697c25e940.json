This work proposes a new selective grasping system using only point clouds of objects. For the selection of the object of interest, a deep learning network for object classification is proposed, named Point Encoder Convolution (PEC). The network is trained with a dataset obtained in a realistic simulator and uses an autoencoder with 1D convolution. The developed grasping algorithm used in the system uses geometry primitives and lateral curvatures to estimate the best region to grasp without previously knowing the object\u2019s point cloud. Experimental results show a success ratio of 94% for a dataset with five classes, and the proposed visual selective grasping system can be executed in around 0.004 s, suitable for tasks that require a low execution time or use low-cost hardware.", "venue": "Machines", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-05-11", "journal": {"name": "Machines"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2217032915", "name": "Daniel Moura de Oliveira"}, {"authorId": "1481708949", "name": "A.
