However, massive MIMO systems are still limited because of pilot contamination (PC), which impacts the data rate (DR) due to the non-orthogonality of pilot sequences transmitted by users in the same cell to the neighbouring cells. We propose a channel estimation with complete knowledge of large-scale fading by using an orthogonal pilot reuse sequence (PRS) to eliminate PC in edge users with poor channel quality based on the estimation of largescale fading and performance analysis of maximum ratio transmission (MRT) and zero forcing (ZF) precoding methods. We derived the lower bounds on the achievable downlink DR and signal-to interference noise ratio (SINR) based on assigning PRS to a user grouping that mitigated this problem when the number of antenna elements M \u2192 \u221e. The simulation results showed that a high DR can be achieved due to better channel estimation and reduced performance loss.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Engineering", "Mathematics"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-06-25", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2106.13507"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "123456218", "name": "Qazwan Abdullah  (\u063a\u0632\u0648\u0627\u0646 \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0637\u0631\u0628\u0648\u0634)"}, {"authorId": "2143201805", "name": "Norsaliza Abdullah"}, {"authorId": "2087062609", "name": "A.
