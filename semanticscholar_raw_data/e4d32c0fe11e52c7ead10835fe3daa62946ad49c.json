Data stream processing is different from static data processing which resides in a database. The data stream data is seen only once. It is too voluminous to store statically. A small portion of data called a window is considered at a time for querying, computing aggregates, etc. In this chapter, the authors explain the different types of window movement over incoming data. A query on a stream is repeatedly executed on the new data created by the movement of the window. SQL extensions to handle continuous queries is addressed in this chapter. Streams that contain transactional data as well as those that contain events are considered.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "", "pages": "20-39", "volume": ""}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2275971873", "name": "Parimala N."}], "citations": []}
