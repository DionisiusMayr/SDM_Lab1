This study presents the waterwheel plant technique (WWPA), a novel stochastic optimization technique motivated by natural systems. The proposed WWPA\u2019s basic concept is based on modeling the waterwheel plant\u2019s natural behavior while on a hunting expedition. To find prey, WWPA uses plants as search agents. We present WWPA\u2019s mathematical model for use in addressing optimization problems. Twenty-three objective functions of varying unimodal and multimodal types were used to assess WWPA\u2019s performance. The results of optimizing unimodal functions demonstrate WWPA\u2019s strong exploitation ability to get close to the optimal solution, while the results of optimizing multimodal functions show WWPA\u2019s strong exploration ability to zero in on the major optimal region of the search space. Three engineering design problems were also used to gauge WWPA\u2019s potential for improving practical programs. The effectiveness of WWPA in optimization was evaluated by comparing its results with those of seven widely used metaheuristic algorithms. When compared with eight competing algorithms, the simulation results and analyses demonstrate that WWPA outperformed them by finding a more proportionate balance between exploration and exploitation.", "venue": "Processes", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-05-15", "journal": {"name": "Processes"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2056491743", "name": "Abdelaziz A.
