This process separates the software development project from the software deployment phase and it represents a critical obstacle for software performance on the software developer side and deployment effectiveness from the software execution side. Although the automation of this process is an active research topic for almost half a century, the standardized procedures that would enable full automation across various software projects, but also across time, are still missing. The main reason lies in the variety of methods and tools used in software development and their evolution. Therefore, many researchers and practitioners report a low build success rate. Researchers have investigated this problem from software development, integrator, and software evolution perspectives. In this paper, a study is set up in order to contribute to the overall understanding of the level of standardization among FOSS software repositories and automation abilities. A rich source of information lies in FOSS repositories and mining these repositories with joined developers and deployment perspective would bring valuable knowledge into the software engineering profession.", "venue": "SQAMIA", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2140647537", "name": "Dalibor Fonovi\u0107"}, {"authorId": "3334073", "name": "Tihana Galinac Grbac"}], "citations": []}
