In terms of the role as learning material providers, academic libraries were investigated the most and radio frequency identification (RFID) was mainly adopted. In terms of the role as inquiry context providers, special libraries were explored the most; adopted sensing technologies were more diverse (e.g. QR code, augmented reality, RFID and Global Positioning System). Only special libraries played a role as knowledge-sharing platforms, adopting augmented reality. Most research on library-supported mobile learning mainly focused on investigating the affective domain during mobile learning.\n\n\nPractical implications\nFive potential applications of educational roles in library-supported mobile learning are suggested based on the findings of the present study.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThe current study provides insights relevant to the educational roles of library-supported mobile learning. The findings and suggestions can serve as references for researchers and school teachers conducting library-supported mobile learning.\n", "venue": "Electronic library", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Sociology"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2020-08-14", "journal": {"name": "Electron.
