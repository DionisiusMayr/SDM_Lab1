Also, they are in a large scale in two dimensions: first, they are capable of processing big data (e.g., both in terms of volume and velocity) mainly through employing massive parallelism, and second, they can run over (powerful) distributed infrastructures. This article focuses on edge computing and its confluence with big data analytics workflows, which nowadays place special emphasis on deep learning and data quality.", "venue": "IEEE Internet Computing", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-01-01", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Internet Computing", "pages": "61-69", "volume": "27"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1698942", "name": "A.
