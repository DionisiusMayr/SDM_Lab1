In this context, data replication technique is frequently used to ensure a Quality of service, e.g., performance. However, most of the existing data replication strategies just reproduce the same number of replicas on some nodes, which is certainly not enough for more accurate results. To solve these problems, we propose a new data Replication and Placement strategy based on popularity of User Requests Group (RPURG). It aims to reduce the tenant response time and maximize benefit for the cloud provider while satisfying the Service Level Agreement (SLA). We demonstrate the validity of our strategy in a performance evaluation study. The result of experimentation shown robustness of RPURG.", "venue": "Multiagent and Grid Systems", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "Multiagent Grid Syst.", "pages": "159-177", "volume": "17"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "115161550", "name": "Abdenour Lazeb"}, {"authorId": "1962762", "name": "R.
