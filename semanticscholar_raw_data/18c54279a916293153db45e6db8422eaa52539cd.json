We present a biased view, focusing on work done by our own group, while citing related work in each area. In particular, we discuss in detail the properties of continual learning, providing engaging content, and being well-behaved -- and how to measure success in providing them. We end with a discussion of our experience and learnings, and our recommendations to the community.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-06-22", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2006.12442"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3849208", "name": "Stephen Roller"}, {"authorId": "2656573", "name": "Y-Lan Boureau"}, {"authorId": "145183709", "name": "J.
