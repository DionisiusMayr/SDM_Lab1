We built a prototype, HadoopDB, and demonstrated that it can deliver the high SQL query performance and e\ufb03ciency of parallel database management systems while still providing the scalability, fault tolerance, and \ufb02ex-ibility of large-scale data processing systems. Subsequently, HadoopDB grew into a commercial product, Hadapt, whose technology was eventually acquired by Teradata. In this paper, we provide an overview of HadoopDB\u2019s original design, and its evolution during the subsequent ten years of research and development e\ufb00ort. We describe how the project inno-vated both in the research lab, and as a commercial product at Hadapt and Teradata. We then discuss the current vibrant ecosystem of software projects (most of which are open source) that continued HadoopDB\u2019s legacy of implementing a systems level integration of large-scale data processing systems and parallel database technology.", "venue": "Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2019-08-01", "journal": {"name": "Proc.
