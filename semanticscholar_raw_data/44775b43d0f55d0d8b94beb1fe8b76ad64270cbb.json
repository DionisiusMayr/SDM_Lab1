For computing massive random walks, recent works show that GPUs provide a good option to accelerate the performance. However, due to the limited memory space of modern GPUs, it is infeasible to have both the graph data and walk index fully reside in GPU memory when running large-scale random walks. Thus, it necessitates an out-of-GPU-memory design, but this inevitably induces large amounts of CPU-GPU data transmission traffic and thus hinders the overall performance. In this paper, we develop LightTraffic, which optimizes the data transmission between CPU and GPU memory under the constraint of GPU memory capacity with various system designs, including a memory-efficient scheme for partition-based management and multiple scheduling techniques. LightTraffic is a fully out-of-GPU-memory design, so it supports running large-scale random walks on GPUs. Experiments on our prototype show that LightTraffic outperforms various state-of-the-art CPU-based in-memory systems which also support large-scale random walks. For example, compared to the CPU-based systems FlashMob and ThunderRW, which are highly optimized for random walks, LightTraffic achieves 1.7\u22125.0\u00d7 and 1.4 \u2212 12.8\u00d7 performance speedup, respectively. It also achieves up to an order of magnitude speedup when compared to the GPU-based system Subway which also supports large-scale random walks with an out-of-GPU-memory design for graph data.", "venue": "IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-04-01", "journal": {"name": "2023 IEEE 39th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE)", "pages": "882-895"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "46201569", "name": "Yipeng Xing"}, {"authorId": "2110412112", "name": "Yongkun Li"}, {"authorId": "2223887012", "name": "Zhiqiang Wang"}, {"authorId": "2145205129", "name": "Yinlong Xu"}, {"authorId": "145462046", "name": "John C.S.
