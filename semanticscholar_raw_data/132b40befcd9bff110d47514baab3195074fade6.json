This raises the challenge of implementing high-performance software systems that can effectively scale from a single core to multicore to the globe. Conventional wisdom says that software designed for one scale point needs to be rewritten when scaling up by <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$10-100\\times$</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:mrow><mml:mn>10</mml:mn><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>100</mml:mn><mml:mo>\u00d7</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href=\"wu-ieq1-2898401.gif\"/></alternatives></inline-formula> <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"ref1\">[1]</xref> . In contrast, we explore how a system can be architected to scale across many orders of magnitude by design. We explore this challenge in the context of a new key-value store system called Anna: a partitioned, multi-mastered system that achieves high performance and elasticity via wait-free execution and coordination-free consistency. Our design rests on a simple architecture of coordination-free actors that perform state update via merge of lattice-based composite data structures. We demonstrate that a wide variety of consistency models can be elegantly implemented in this architecture with unprecedented consistency, smooth fine-grained elasticity, and performance that far exceeds the state of the art.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2019-02-12", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering", "pages": "344-358", "volume": "33"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "144329773", "name": "Chenggang Wu"}, {"authorId": "145963370", "name": "Jose M.
