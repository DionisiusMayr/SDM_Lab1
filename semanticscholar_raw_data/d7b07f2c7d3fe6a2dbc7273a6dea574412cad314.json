Considering this situation, large-scale processing has become a very important issue in document clustering, due to its capability to organize large numbers of documents as few meaningful and consistent clusters. In this study, a dataset consisting of 390 English textbooks with a total size of 7.61 GB, has been used for the clustering task. Locality sensitive hashing and k-shingles methods have been used to obtain clusters with high quality. Clusters have been evaluated using cluster validity indices. According to the experimental results, high-quality clusters have been obtained, with 0.88 and 0.79 for Silhouette and Davies\u2013Bouldin scores, respectively.", "venue": "International Conference on Music and Artificial Intelligence", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book"], "publicationDate": "2021-03-19", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 2021 6th International Conference on Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2125213029", "name": "Kevser \u00d6zdem"}, {"authorId": "143804800", "name": "M.
