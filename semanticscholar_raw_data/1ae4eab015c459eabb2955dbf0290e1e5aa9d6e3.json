Although this sector faces a hard challenge in COV\u0393D-19 pandemic, it has been predicted that it will rebound and will continue in growing as in previous periods. Tourist experience should become important to be improved regarding the service level for visitors such as the improvement of hotel customer accommodation. The aim of this study is classifying the hotel customer based on Support Vector Machine (SVM). This classification conducted through classification of satisfaction level and the related factors. The result of the study presented a good accuracy and precision of SVM in conducting customer hotel classification at 93% accuracy level with error level of prediction result for about 0.27 based on Root Mean Squared Error (RSME) function. The features of customer satisfaction at this study are proposed to be important preferences for improvement of customer services in hospitality.", "venue": "2021 International Conference on Advanced Mechatronics, Intelligent Manufacture and Industrial Automation (ICAMIMIA)", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2021-12-08", "journal": {"name": "2021 International Conference on Advanced Mechatronics, Intelligent Manufacture and Industrial Automation (ICAMIMIA)", "pages": "102-107"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2058415609", "name": "C.
