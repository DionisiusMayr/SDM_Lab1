In this paper, we present a strategy for organizing IIoT data to facilitate data processing, storage, analysis, and visualization based on a typical oil combat operation scenario. A web-based system has been implemented and deployed and real-time data streams from the oil detectors are presented interactively, satisfying different users' needs.", "venue": "Oceans", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2017-06-01", "journal": {"name": "OCEANS 2017 - Aberdeen", "pages": "1-5"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3133311", "name": "Ottar L.
