This enables far richer search modalities such as images, speaker, content, topic, and emotion. A key element for this process is highly rapid, flexible, search to support large archives, which in MVSE is facilitated by representing video attributes by embeddings. This work aims to mitigate any performance loss from this rapid archive search by examining reranking approaches. In particular, zero-shot reranking methods using large language models are investigated as these are applicable to any video archive audio content. Performance is evaluated for topic-based retrieval on a publicly available video archive, the BBC Rewind corpus. Results demonstrate that reranking can achieve improved retrieval ranking without the need for any task-specific training data.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-09-14", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2309.07606"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "10769548", "name": "Mengjie Qian"}, {"authorId": "50397234", "name": "Rao Ma"}, {"authorId": "2190750613", "name": "Adian Liusie"}, {"authorId": "2791396", "name": "Erfan Loweimi"}, {"authorId": "145962472", "name": "K.
