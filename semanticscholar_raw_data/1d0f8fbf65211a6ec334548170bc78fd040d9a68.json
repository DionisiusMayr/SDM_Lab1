Public Private Partnerships (PPP) play a significant role in this control but are exposed to 12 several risks. This study proposes a new risk classification prediction model for water treatment PPP 13 projects to address these risks more effectively than traditional methods. The proposed model includes 14 four key areas of risk: natural environment, ecological environment, socio-economic, and engineering 15 entity. The study examines the correlation between these risk factors and project risk levels and develops 16 an ensemble learning model based on Stacking for risk prediction. This model improves performance by 17 using a weighted voting mechanism to adjust the importance of base learners. This model was tested 18 using data from Phase I of the Jiujiang City water environment system project, demonstrating its 19 effectiveness and accuracy. The proposed model outperforms other traditional machine learning models 20 in terms of accuracy, macro-average precision, recall, and F1-score. Thus, it provides an effective method 21 for risk classification prediction in water treatment PPP projects.", "venue": "", "year": null, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2213837235", "name": "Ruijia Yang"}, {"authorId": "2287779180", "name": "Jingchun Feng"}, {"authorId": "2287412876", "name": "Yong Sun"}], "citations": []}
