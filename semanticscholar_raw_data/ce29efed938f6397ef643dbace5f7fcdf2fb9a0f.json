It can be used to determine the whole genome of a target virus in a biological sample. Its Read Until feature allows us to skip sequencing a majority of non-target reads (DNA/RNA fragments), which constitutes more than 99% of all reads in a typical sample. However, it does not have any on-board computing, which significantly limits its portability. We analyze the performance of a Read Until metagenomic pipeline for detecting target viruses and identifying strain-specific mutations. We find new sources of performance bottlenecks (basecaller in classification of a read) that are not addressed by past genomics accelerators. We present SquiggleFilter, a novel hardware accelerated dynamic time warping (DTW) based filter that directly analyzes MinION\u2019s raw squiggles and filters everything except target viral reads, thereby avoiding the expensive basecalling step. We show that our 14.3W 13.25mm2 accelerator has 274 \u00d7 greater throughput and 3481 \u00d7 lower latency than existing GPU-based solutions while consuming half the power, enabling Read Until for the next generation of nanopore sequencers.", "venue": "Micro", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Biology"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2021-08-14", "journal": {"name": "MICRO-54: 54th Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "40040568", "name": "Timothy W.
