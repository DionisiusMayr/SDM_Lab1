It is also a basic problem applied to solve other problems such as the betweenness centrality problem, the closeness centrality problem... Therefore, in all graph processing platforms, there is a way to solve this problem. Apache Spark GraphX is also. However, the shortest path finding algorithm in GraphX has some drawbacks to discuss more. Therefore, in this paper we analyze some issues in finding the shortest path in GraphX, then we propose two new algorithms to improve for better performance, and finally we compare the performance between the shortest path finding algorithm in GraphX and proposed algorithms.", "venue": "International Conference on Machine Learning and Soft Computing", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2018-02-02", "journal": {"pages": "67-71"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2053733955", "name": "T.
