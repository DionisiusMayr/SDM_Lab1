Linked Data reveals the need for big semantic data processing. The underlying literature already discusses numerous attempts at leveraging the relational engines of Big Data frameworks like Apache Spark to run SPARQL queries at scale. However, the choice of a relational schema to store RDF data may signi\ufb01cantly impact the query performance and hence various alternatives exist. In this paper, we investigate the improvement of two recent proposals, i.e., Extended Vertically Partitioned Tables and Wide Property Tables , w.r.t. the baseline approaches Vertically Partitioned Tables and Property Tables . To generalize our results, we observe how the two schemas behave together with di\ufb00erent RDF partitioning techniques and HDFS storage data formats. We run our experiments using SparkSQL over a 100-million triples dataset generated using SP 2 Bench .", "venue": "International Workshop on the Semantic Web", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"pages": "30-34"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2065777089", "name": "Mohamed Ragab"}, {"authorId": "50271459", "name": "Riccardo Tommasini"}, {"authorId": "1783693", "name": "Sherif Sakr"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "1848fd7dc64e9cd99ebe7a67dd3672907ca851fb", "title": "PAPAYA: A library for performance analysis of SQL-based RDF processing systems"}]}
