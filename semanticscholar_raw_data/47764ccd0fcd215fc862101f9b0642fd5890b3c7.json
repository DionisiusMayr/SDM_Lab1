As the amount of vector data grows continuously, it becomes important to support updates to vector index, the enabling technique that allows for efficient and accurate ANNS on vectors. Because of the curse of high dimensionality, it is often costly to identify the right neighbors of a new vector, a necessary process for index update. To amortize update costs, existing systems maintain a secondary index to accumulate updates, which are merged with the main index by globally rebuilding the entire index periodically. However, this approach has high fluctuations of search latency and accuracy, not to mention that it requires substantial resources and is extremely time-consuming to rebuild. We introduce SPFresh, a system that supports in-place vector updates. At the heart of SPFresh is LIRE, a lightweight incremental rebalancing protocol to split vector partitions and reassign vectors in the nearby partitions to adapt to data distribution shifts. LIRE achieves low-overhead vector updates by only reassigning vectors at the boundary between partitions, where in a high-quality vector index the amount of such vectors is deemed small. With LIRE, SPFresh provides superior query latency and accuracy to solutions based on global rebuild, with only 1% of DRAM and less than 10% cores needed at the peak compared to the state-of-the-art, in a billion scale disk-based vector index with a 1% of daily vector update rate.", "venue": "Symposium on Operating Systems Principles", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-10-23", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 29th Symposium on Operating Systems Principles"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2254108989", "name": "Yuming Xu"}, {"authorId": "2256480429", "name": "Hengyu Liang"}, {"authorId": "2253896161", "name": "Jin Li"}, {"authorId": "2253867834", "name": "Shuotao Xu"}, {"authorId": "2254026795", "name": "Qi Chen"}, {"authorId": "2108076499", "name": "Qianxi Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2244595439", "name": "Cheng Li"}, {"authorId": "2254136087", "name": "Ziyue Yang"}, {"authorId": "145338263", "name": "Fan Yang"}, {"authorId": "2108623481", "name": "Yuqing Yang"}, {"authorId": "2237779961", "name": "Peng Cheng"}, {"authorId": "2253823993", "name": "Mao Yang"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "86711aa590fbbaa22e991e1affceb61f745ae4f2", "title": "Efficient Data Access Paths for Mixed Vector-Relational Search"}]}
