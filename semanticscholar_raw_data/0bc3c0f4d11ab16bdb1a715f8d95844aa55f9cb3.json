As the amount of data continues to grow up, companies need to be able to process it rapidly, ef\ufb01ciently, and securely. Since sensitive information is often included among the company's data, safeguarding this sensitive data has always been a challenging requirement for many organizations. Therefore, the proposed Dynamic Data Sensitivity Access Control (D2SAC) framework in [1] focuses on protecting sensitive data in Hadoop Platform. To continue improving our framework, in this paper, we concentrate on the Sensitivity Estimator Module (SEM) which is responsible for calculating the data sensitivity value. For this reason, we propose a mathematical model based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method in order to derive the priority vector of data attributes then the empirical average is used to calculate the \ufb01nal data sensitivity value a way to provide an automated calculation of sensitivity without any intervention of the Data Owner.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "65820337", "name": "Hafsa Ait Idar"}, {"authorId": "9218544", "name": "H.
