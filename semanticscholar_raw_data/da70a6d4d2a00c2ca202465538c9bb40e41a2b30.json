It can help them understand their customers better, improve their products and services, and increase their profits. This study aims to use Big Data technology to design personalized loyalty programs that can enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty in the context of Society 5.0, a vision of a human-centered society that integrates physical and digital realms. The study builds on utility theory, firm theory, welfare economics, and Big Data theory to develop a conceptual framework for information-centric loyalty programs. These programs can use Big Data to analyze customer behavior, preferences, income, and mobility in real time and offer customized incentives and discounts. The study also explores the benefits and challenges of using Big Data technology for businesses in emerging markets, as well as its role in crisis management and recovery. The study suggests that Big Data technology is essential for businesses to gain a competitive edge and survive in the dynamic and uncertain environment of Society 5.0.", "venue": "M3E2-MLPEED", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"pages": "82-94"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2237786458", "name": "Piotr Kulyk"}, {"authorId": "2219208158", "name": "Viktoriia Hurochkina"}, {"authorId": "2121184330", "name": "Bohdan Patsai"}, {"authorId": "2237785796", "name": "Olena Voronkova"}, {"authorId": "119160829", "name": "O.
