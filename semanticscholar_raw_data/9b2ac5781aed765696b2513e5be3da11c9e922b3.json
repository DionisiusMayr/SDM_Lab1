Given a schema, it allows the column-oriented storage of nested data such as JSON. As a column-oriented format, it naturally plays well with compression techniques such as run-length encoding, whose efficiency is known to be affected by the row order. In this paper, we investigate the extent to which the information contained in a schema with many optional nodes is sufficient to perform column- and row-reordering effectively. We show that the frequently used increasing-cardinality heuristic is suboptimal in this use case and propose a novel block-based heuristic that reduces the run count by an additional factor of two and can lead to smaller file sizes despite working on fewer data.", "venue": "BiDEDE@SIGMOD", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book"], "publicationDate": "2023-06-18", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the International Workshop on Big Data in Emergent Distributed Environments"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "101865458", "name": "P.
