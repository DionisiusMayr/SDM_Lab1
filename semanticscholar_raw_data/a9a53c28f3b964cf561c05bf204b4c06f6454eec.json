This paper introduces the bipartite-play method, a dialogue collection method for automating dialogue system evaluation. It addresses the limitations of existing dialogue collection methods: (i) inability to compare with systems that are not publicly available, and (ii) vulnerability to cheating by intentionally selecting systems to be compared. Experimental results show that the automatic evaluation using the bipartite-play method mitigates these two drawbacks and correlates as strongly with human subjectivity as existing methods.", "venue": "AACL", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-11-19", "journal": {"pages": "8-16"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1661093124", "name": "Shiki Sato"}, {"authorId": "2185502963", "name": "Yosuke Kishinami"}, {"authorId": "1873769", "name": "Hiroaki Sugiyama"}, {"authorId": "31487889", "name": "Reina Akama"}, {"authorId": "3450697", "name": "Ryoko Tokuhisa"}, {"authorId": "144042991", "name": "Jun Suzuki"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "ec9edb906a259aec3b3855f9933bf584fe3fac00", "title": "Approximating Online Human Evaluation of Social Chatbots with Prompting"}, {"paperId": "511901aa2aeba02c555045f8841275a74964400a", "title": "Approximating Human Evaluation of Social Chatbots with Prompting"}]}
