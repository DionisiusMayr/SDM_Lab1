However, great opportunity comes with great challenges: Hive query performance is impacted by many factors which makes capacity planning and tuning for Hive cluster extremely difficult. These factors include system software stacks (Hive, MapReduce framework, JVM and OS), cluster hardware configurations (processor, memory, storage, and network) and HIVE data models and distributions. Current planning methods are mostly trial-and-error or very high-level estimation based. These approaches are far from efficient and accurate, especially with the increasing software stack complexity, hardware diversity, and unavoidable data skew in distributed database system. In this paper, we propose a Hive simulation framework based on CSMethod, which simulates the whole hive query execution life cycle, including query plan generation and MapReduce task execution. The framework is validated using typical query operations with varying changes in hardware, software and workload parameters, showing high accuracy and fast simulation speed. We also demonstrate the application of this framework with two real-world use cases: helping customers to perform capacity planning and estimate business query response time before system provisioning.", "venue": "IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science", "year": 2014, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2014-12-15", "journal": {"name": "2014 IEEE 6th International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science", "pages": "475-482"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "48884711", "name": "Kebing Wang"}, {"authorId": "2492588", "name": "Zhaojuan Bian"}, {"authorId": "2157954146", "name": "Qian Chen"}, {"authorId": "153537265", "name": "Ren Wang"}, {"authorId": "145702311", "name": "Gen Xu"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "498dc915d93766b11415b34e873f730f8f9e9890", "title": "KPIs-Based Clustering and Visualization of HPC Jobs: A Feature Reduction Approach"}, {"paperId": "ad86b4e8370ced6a123a059cc7b79f289730bd7e", "title": "Predicting Performance of Heterogeneous AI Systems with Discrete-Event Simulations"}, {"paperId": "21e7023c4ed4448137e6f2f8f41e1adcc3ddcfb2", "title": "Simulation-Based Performance Prediction of HPC Applications: A Case Study of HPL"}, {"paperId": "7cbdc8cbd4e389a541a1761cf5fae977ba255041", "title": "A Survey of Big Data Machine Learning Applications Optimization in Cloud Data Centers and Networks"}, {"paperId": "b946b08e8585220024d280c5eeb5cce99fe1ca4b", "title": "Analysis of Aadhaar Card Dataset Using Big Data Analytics"}, {"paperId": "f8c7757c27546f8a041f323fec67abf27f43a4d8", "title": "An Investigation of Hadoop Parameters in SDN-enabled Clusters"}, {"paperId": "29dcf1612e8c504af89b0dbb8eb985b6173c5403", "title": "DeepSim: Cluster Level Behavioral Simulation Model for Deep Learning"}, {"paperId": "bdf0018d33daf98c2b48ef366878368ba18434d4", "title": "Planning Your SQL-on-Hadoop Deployment Using a Low-Cost Simulation-Based Approach"}, {"paperId": "f0bbd99c0a25c797ca9f3c590a7a5f514f2c2f67", "title": "Millipedes: Distributed and Set-Based Sub-Task Scheduler of Computing Engines Running on Yarn Cluster"}, {"paperId": "164cad425332142b149671e0c6622419e0fd40e3", "title": "Essential Learning Components from Big Data Case Studies"}]}
