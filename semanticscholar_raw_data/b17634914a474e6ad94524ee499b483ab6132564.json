It has the characteristics of large amount of data, high concurrency, strong reading and writing ability, flexible use, simple data structure and good scalability. Non relational database can solve the problem of data cache and reduce the connection of tables. Based on the analysis of the performance of non relational database, this paper compares the performance of several non relational databases. Firstly, this paper introduces the concept of non relational database and the classification of non relational database. Then the read and write performance of commonly used non-relational databases MongDB and Redis are compared in detail. Finally, the performance of four non-relational databases in different usage scenarios is compared.", "venue": "2021 IEEE 23rd Int Conf on High Performance Computing & Communications; 7th Int Conf on Data Science & Systems; 19th Int Conf on Smart City; 7th Int Conf on Dependability in Sensor, Cloud & Big Data Systems & Application (HPCC/DSS/SmartCity/DependSys)", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2021-12-01", "journal": {"name": "2021 IEEE 23rd Int Conf on High Performance Computing & Communications; 7th Int Conf on Data Science & Systems; 19th Int Conf on Smart City; 7th Int Conf on Dependability in Sensor, Cloud & Big Data Systems & Application (HPCC/DSS/SmartCity/DependSys)", "pages": "2278-2282"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2157052257", "name": "Jingbo Li"}, {"authorId": "2435068", "name": "Rongli Gai"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "b4a7e6dd8775ed96006d16fa520cfe268716af86", "title": "Database Management System: A Study of Increasing Impact of NoSQL Databases"}, {"paperId": "89543389c6d537ee94caad951415669d522de4f8", "title": "Performance Improvement on a Learning Assessment Web Application Using AWS DynamoDB as a Cache Database"}]}
