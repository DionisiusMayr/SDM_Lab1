As an NP-complete problem, accelerating computation performance is the main target for current optimizations. Due to excellent performance, state-of-the-art graph mining systems mainly rely on pattern-aware algorithms. Despite previous efforts, complex control flows introduced by pattern-aware algorithms bring significant overhead and also impede further acceleration on heterogeneous hardware. To address these challenges, we propose a set-based equivalent transformation approach to optimize pattern-aware graph mining applications, which can leverage classic set properties to eliminate most control flows and reduce computation overhead exponentially. We further implement a high-performance pattern-aware graph mining system supporting both CPU and GPU, namely GraphSet, to automatically apply these transformations. Evaluation results show that GraphSet outperforms state-of-the-art cross-platform and hardware-specific graph mining frameworks by up to 3384.1x and 243.2x (18.0X and 10.2x on average), respectively.", "venue": "International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-11-11", "journal": {"name": "SC23: International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis", "pages": "1-15"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "40864057", "name": "Tianhui Shi"}, {"authorId": "2467444", "name": "Jidong Zhai"}, {"authorId": "2262527866", "name": "Haojie Wang"}, {"authorId": "2262448550", "name": "Qiqian Chen"}, {"authorId": "1962334303", "name": "Mingshu Zhai"}, {"authorId": "2262455622", "name": "Zixu Hao"}, {"authorId": "2262759000", "name": "Haoyu Yang"}, {"authorId": "2262468726", "name": "Wenguang Chen"}], "citations": []}
