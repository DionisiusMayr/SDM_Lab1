Datalog can be efficiently implemented using relational algebra primitives such as join, projection and union. While there exist several multi-threaded and multi-core implementations of Datalog, targeting CPU-based systems, our work makes an inroad towards developing a Datalog implementation for GPUs. We demonstrate the feasibility of a high-performance relational algebra backend for a subset of Datalog applications that can effectively leverage the parallelism of GPUs using cuDF. cuDF is a library from the Rapids suite that uses the NVIDIA CUDA programming model for GPU parallelism. It provides similar functionalities to Pandas, a popular data analysis engine. In this paper, we analyze and evaluate the performance of cuDF versus Pandas for two graph-mining problems implemented in Datalog, (1) triangle counting and (2) transitive-closure computation.", "venue": "Workshop on Irregular Applications: Architectures and Algorithms", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-11-01", "journal": {"name": "2022 IEEE/ACM Workshop on Irregular Applications: Architectures and Algorithms (IA3)", "pages": "41-45"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "35567165", "name": "Ahmedur Rahman Shovon"}, {"authorId": "2186576677", "name": "Landon Dyken"}, {"authorId": "1723013", "name": "Oded Green"}, {"authorId": "2920296", "name": "Thomas Gilray"}, {"authorId": "1500379929", "name": "Sidharth Kumar"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "ab7eac8eacf50dcb03a5b4a0776f1a248811826e", "title": "Communication-Avoiding Recursive Aggregation"}, {"paperId": "2b8c29e2d9f6ae8969ecb5462eae1d19de091b40", "title": "Towards Iterative Relational Algebra on the GPU"}]}
