Further, when data transmission or storage has to be minimized, as in edge computing and cyber-physical systems, it can help in identifying the source data to be prioritized. The memory and processing costs of fine-grained data provenance, possibly afforded by high-end servers, can be prohibitive for the resource-constrained devices deployed in edge computing and cyber-physical systems. Motivated by this challenge, we present GeneaLog, a novel fine-grained data provenance technique for data streaming applications. Leveraging the logical dependencies of the data, GeneaLog takes advantage of cross-layer properties of the software stack and incurs a minimal, constant size per-tuple overhead. Furthermore, it allows for a modular and efficient algorithmic implementation using only standard data streaming operators. This is particularly useful for distributed streaming applications since the provenance processing can be executed at separate nodes, orthogonal to the data processing. We evaluate an implementation of GeneaLog using vehicular and smart grid applications, confirming it efficiently captures fine-grained provenance data with minimal overhead.", "venue": "International Middleware Conference", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book"], "publicationDate": "2018-11-26", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 19th International Middleware Conference"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1403617104", "name": "Dimitris Palyvos-Giannas"}, {"authorId": "1912583", "name": "Vincenzo Gulisano"}, {"authorId": "1752071", "name": "M.
