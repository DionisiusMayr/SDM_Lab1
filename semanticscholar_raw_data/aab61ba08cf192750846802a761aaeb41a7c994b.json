After a brief introduction to the process and the governing physics, we give a short overview of the methodology. The ROM is then used to predict temperature distribution within a plastics profile inside the calibration/cooling unit of the extrusion process. The simulation based model predictions are compared with sensor data captured by an infrared camera. Finally, we give an outlook on how both ROM and measurement data can be used to enable a digital shadow of industrial processes.", "venue": "Pamm", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-05-01", "journal": {"name": "PAMM", "volume": "23"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2159203147", "name": "Daniel Hilger"}, {"authorId": "119112430", "name": "J.
