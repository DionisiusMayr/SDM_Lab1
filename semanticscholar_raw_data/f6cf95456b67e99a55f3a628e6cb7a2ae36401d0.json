Current serverless work\ufb02ow engines rely on master-side patterns which hinder the interaction between serverless functions, causing performance issues. In this paper, a decentralized worker-side pattern is proposed that provides enhanced performance by allowing each work\ufb02ow function to schedule itself from the current node to the next without having to interact with the master controller. It treats the serverless work\ufb02ow as a whole unit and uses a locality strategy to optimize performance. A new high-performance work\ufb02ow engine called BriskChain has been implemented to demonstrate the e\ufb00ectiveness of this approach. Experiments on a real-world application show that BriskChain is able to achieve 2.5 times better performance than a state-of-the-art serverless work\ufb02ow engine.", "venue": "", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2157404298", "name": "Jing Ma"}, {"authorId": "2254489055", "name": "Kan Wang"}, {"authorId": "2253466056", "name": "Edmund M-K Lai"}], "citations": []}
