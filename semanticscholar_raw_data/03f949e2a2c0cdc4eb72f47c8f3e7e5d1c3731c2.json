These streams often have a spatiotemporal component and include multidimensional features of interest. Processing such data in an offline fashion using batch systems or data warehouses is costly from both a storage and computational standpoint, and in many situations the insights derived from the data streams are useful only if they are timely. In this study, we propose Synopsis, an online, distributed sketch that is constructed from voluminous spatiotemporal data streams. The sketch summarizes feature values and inter-feature relationships in memory to facilitate real-time query evaluations and to serve as input to computations expressed using analytical engines. As the data streams evolve, Synopsis performs targeted dynamic scaling to ensure high accuracy and effective resource utilization. We evaluate our system in the context of two real-world spatiotemporal datasets and demonstrate its efficacy in both scalability and query evaluations.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2017-11-01", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering", "pages": "2552-2566", "volume": "29"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3438590", "name": "Thilina Buddhika"}, {"authorId": "2528759", "name": "Matthew Malensek"}, {"authorId": "145069202", "name": "S.
