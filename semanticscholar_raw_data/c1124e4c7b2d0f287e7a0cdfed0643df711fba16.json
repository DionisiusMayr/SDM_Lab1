Unfortunately, the meaning of such rules has been a significant challenge, leading to many different conflicting semantics. \nThis paper describes a unified semantics for recursive rules with aggregation, extending the unified founded semantics and constraint semantics for recursive rules with negation. The key idea is to support simple expression of the different assumptions underlying different semantics, and orthogonally interpret aggregation operations straightforwardly using their simple usual meaning.", "venue": "Symposium on Logical Foundations of Computer Science", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-07-26", "journal": {"name": "J.
