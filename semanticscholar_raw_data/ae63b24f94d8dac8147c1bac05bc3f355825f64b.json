At the same time, the integrated development of the power big data and AI techniques gives out the new opportunity. Thanks to the above description, power equipment portrait technology develops rapidly and has broad application prospects in the state estimation and fault diagnosis of power equipment. This paper first introduces the framework of power equipment portrait, and then introduces the research status of power equipment portrait data collection and processing methods from four aspects, and then introduces the establishment method of power equipment label system and the analysis method and application scenarios of power equipment portrait. Finally, the future research direction of power equipment portrait is proposed.", "venue": "2022 IEEE 5th International Electrical and Energy Conference (CIEEC)", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-05-27", "journal": {"name": "2022 IEEE 5th International Electrical and Energy Conference (CIEEC)", "pages": "2035-2040"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2118339346", "name": "Yisong Zhu"}, {"authorId": "67230731", "name": "Ling-hua Ju"}, {"authorId": "2206031070", "name": "Jin Wang"}, {"authorId": "2128700048", "name": "Zhenyang Liu"}, {"authorId": "2124911720", "name": "Juheng Wang"}, {"authorId": "48744911", "name": "K.
