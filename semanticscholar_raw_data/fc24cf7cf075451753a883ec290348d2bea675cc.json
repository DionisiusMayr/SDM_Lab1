Furthermore, while observing the diverse techniques and frameworks of data analysis of SEM, the authors propose a novel framework for SEM by using gamification approach for enhancing the involvement of consumers to conserve energy and improve efficiency.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nA few research strategies have been accounted for analyzing the raw data, yet at the same time, a considerable measure of work should be done in making these commercially reasonable. Data analytic tools and integrated data analyzing approaches are used on SEMs. Furthermore, while observing the diverse techniques and frameworks of data analysis of SEM, the authors propose a novel framework for SEM by using gamification approach for enhancing the involvement of consumers to conserve energy and improve efficiency. Advantages of SEM\u2019s are additionally discussed for inspiring consumers, utilities and their respective partners.\n\n\nFindings\nConsumers, utilities and researchers can also take benefit of the recommended framework by planning their routine activities and enjoying rewards offered by gamification approach. Through gamification, consumers\u2019 commitment enhances, and it changes their less manageable conduct on an intentional premise. The practical implementation of such approaches showed the improved energy efficiency as a consequence.\n", "venue": "International Journal of Energy Sector Management", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Economics"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2019-06-03", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Energy Sector Management"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "35203058", "name": "Kiran Ahuja"}, {"authorId": "145582317", "name": "A.
