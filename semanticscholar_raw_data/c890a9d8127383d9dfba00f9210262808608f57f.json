Owing to their strong invasiveness and harmful effects on agricultural production and ecosystems, they have attracted considerable attention. However, less research has been conducted on the whole picture of the current research status and development trends in the ASs field. For this purpose, we conducted a bibliometric analysis based on a total of 1028 publications regarding ASs published between 1900 and 2021 using VOSviewer 1.6.18 and CiteSpace 6.1.R3 software. The results suggest that ASs research has received increasing attention in recent years. The most productive country has been the USA, while the institution with the most publications was Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas y T\u00e9cnicas Conicet. \u201cZoology\u201d was the category of the most popular subject, Journal of Molluscan Studies was the primary journal, and P.R. Martin was the most outstanding author in ASs field. Invasive alien species, alarm response, copper (Cu) exposure, taxonomy and phylogenetic analysis, Angiostrongylus cantonensis (parasite), control (including molluscicidal activity), growth and reproduction, and feeding preferences were the main research hotspots. Further, \u201cPomacea maculata\u201d, \u201cEvolution\u201d, \u201cBiology\u201d, \u201cDigestive gland\u201d, \u201cPhylogeny\u201d, \u201cIdentification\u201d, \u201cPomacea canaliculata caenogastropoda\u201d, \u201cDiversity\u201d, and \u201cNonnative apple snail\u201d have been emerging active topics in recent years. These findings can help researchers in this area to better understand the direction and advances of ASs research and are valuable for future research and agricultural practice of apple snail control.", "venue": "Agronomy", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-06-21", "journal": {"name": "Agronomy"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2150423246", "name": "Fucheng Yao"}, {"authorId": "2143351578", "name": "Yingtong Chen"}, {"authorId": "2222327300", "name": "Jimin Liu"}, {"authorId": "47124895", "name": "Z.
