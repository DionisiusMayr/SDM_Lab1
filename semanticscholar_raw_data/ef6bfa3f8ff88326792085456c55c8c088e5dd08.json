The basic protocol for sending data over the Internet network and many other computer networks is the Internet Protocol (IP).The protocol specifies that each IP packet must have a header which contains (among other things) the IP address of the sender of the packet. Software defined networking (SDN) technology is an approach to network management that enables dynamic, programmatically efficient network configuration in order to improve network performance and monitoring making it more like cloud computing than traditional network management. In this we use SDN architecture for implementing control for IP spoofing by certain algorithm to maintain the flow of Non-used IP by shortest path.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "90274824", "name": "Priyadharshini"}], "citations": []}
