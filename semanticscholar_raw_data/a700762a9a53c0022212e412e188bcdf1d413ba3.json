It works by taking the centroid of the points and the value of the cluster is the sum of distances from the centroid to each point in the cluster. The aim in this paper is to introduce an alternative way to assign a value to a cluster. Motivation is provided. Moreover, whereas the k\u2013means algorithm does not have a natural way to determine k if it is unknown, we can use our method of evaluating a cluster to find good clusters in a sequential manner. The idea uses optimizations over permutations and clusters are set by the cyclic groups; generated by the Hungarian algorithm.", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-08-04", "journal": {"name": "PLoS ONE", "volume": "16"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2887387", "name": "A.
