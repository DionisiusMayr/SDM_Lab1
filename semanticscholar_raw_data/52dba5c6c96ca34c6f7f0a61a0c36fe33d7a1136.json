Augmented reality technology is a technology that is upgraded on the basis of virtual reality technology. Through this technology, scenes in the real world can be perfectly integrated into the virtual world, so that the two scenes can complement each other, for the better implementation, the Unity3d should be combined. As the innovative aspect, this paper proposes the interactive mode with the analysis of the flow data. The data mining section is optimized with the complex data structure. The system is implemented and tested on the collected data. It is reflected from the results that the proposed framework is efficient.", "venue": "International Conference on Communication and Electronics Systems", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2021-07-08", "journal": {"name": "2021 6th International Conference on Communication and Electronics Systems (ICCES)", "pages": "1721-1724"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "50088406", "name": "Xufeng Ma"}], "citations": []}
