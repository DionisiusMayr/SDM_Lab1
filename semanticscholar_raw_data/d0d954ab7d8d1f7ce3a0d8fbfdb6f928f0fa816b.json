Cloud computing providers such as AWS, GCP, and Azure offer immense computing power on demand, but tapping into that power from a robot is non-trivial. In this paper, we present FogROS 2, an easy-to-use, open-source platform to facilitate cloud and fog robotics that is compatible with the emerging Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) standard. FogROS 2 provisions a cloud computer, deploys and launches ROS 2 nodes to the cloud computer, sets up secure networking between the robot and cloud, and starts the application running. FogROS 2 is completely redesigned and distinct from its predecessor to support ROS 2 applications, transparent video compression and communication, improved performance and security, support for multiple cloud-computing providers, and remote monitoring and visualization. We demonstrate in example applications that the performance gained by using cloud computers can overcome the network latency to signi\ufb01cantly speed up robot performance. In examples, FogROS 2 reduces SLAM latency by 50%, reduces grasp planning time from 14s to 1.2s, and speeds up motion planning 28x. When compared to alternatives, FogROS 2 reduces network utilization by up to 3.8x.
