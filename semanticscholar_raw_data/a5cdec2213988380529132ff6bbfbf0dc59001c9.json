The need for high-speed, distributed, manageability, open-source leads to introducing NoSQL databases. Therefore, relational database may not good with the developing necessities that need more accomplished system. So, choose Redis and MongoDB databases from NoSQL family because they are robust open source databases. But still needs to investigate which NoSQL database is best in reading and writing operations and check the performance from processing time. The relational database does not support to store data in variety of formats because it has inflexible storage structure like table in database. These limitations are only tackling with NoSQL databases and offer preferred storage option for semi-structured data. The results have shown that Redis database has good runtime performance as compared to MongoDB database in performing read and write operations.", "venue": "International Journal for Research in Applied Science and Engineering Technology", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2018-06-30", "journal": {"name": "International Journal for Research in Applied Science and Engineering Technology"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "71282491", "name": "Gurpreet Kaur Spal"}], "citations": []}
