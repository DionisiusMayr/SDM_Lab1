Graphs and the software systems used to work with them are highly diverse. Algorithms interact with hardware in different ways and which graph solution works best on a given platform changes with the structure of the graph. This makes it difficult to decide which graph programming framework is the best for a given situation. In this paper, we try to make sense of this diverse landscape. We evaluate five different frameworks for graph analytics: SuiteS-parse GraphBLAS, Galois, the NWGraph library, the Graph Kernel Collection, and GraphIt. We use the GAP Benchmark Suite to evaluate each framework. GAP consists of 30 tests: six graph algorithms (breadth-first search, single-source shortest path, PageRank, betweenness centrality, connected components, and triangle counting) on five graphs. The GAP Benchmark Suite includes high-performance reference implementations to provide a performance baseline for comparison. Our results show the relative strengths of each framework, but also serve as a case study for the challenges of establishing objective measures for comparing graph frameworks.", "venue": "IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-10-01", "journal": {"name": "2020 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC)", "pages": "216-227"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3032988", "name": "A.
