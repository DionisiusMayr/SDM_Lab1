The problem of generating repairs is typically expressed as an optimization problem, i.e., a single repair is returned that is optimal wrt. to some criterion such as minimizing the repair\u2019s side effects. However, such an optimization objective may not concretely model a user\u2019s (often hard to formalize) notion of which repair is \u201ccorrect\u201d. In this paper, we motivate hybrid explanations and repairs, i.e., that fix both the query and the data. Instead of returning one \u201coptimal\u201d repair, we argue for an approach that empowers the user to explore the space of possible repairs effectively. We also present a proof-of-concept implementation and outline open research problems.", "venue": "The Web Conference", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-04-30", "journal": {"name": "Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "121945033", "name": "Seok-Gyun Lee"}, {"authorId": "1798930", "name": "Boris Glavic"}, {"authorId": "144030084", "name": "Adriane P.
