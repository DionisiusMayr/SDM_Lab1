Accurate forecasting of cyclones with high lead times is an important problem. We propose a framework to predict tropical cyclogenesis (i.e. cyclone formation). This framework executes along with a parallel weather simulation model (WRF) and analyzes the simulation output as soon as they are generated. Our framework has two major components \u2013 a trigger function and a deep predictive model. The trigger function acts as a basic filter to identify cyclones from non-cyclones. The proposed deep learning model is based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The best track data from Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) is used as a reference for labeling data points into disturbances and tropical cyclones. The framework achieves a probability of detection (POD) value of approximately 95% with a false alarm ratio (FAR) of 21.69% overall. The predictions made by the framework have a lead time of up to 150 hours from the time that a disturbance transforms into a tropical cyclone.", "venue": "International Conference on High Performance Computing", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-12-01", "journal": {"name": "2022 IEEE 29th International Conference on High Performance Computing, Data, and Analytics (HiPC)", "pages": "166-175"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "46405788", "name": "Abir Mukherjee"}, {"authorId": "1832035", "name": "Preeti Malakar"}], "citations": []}
