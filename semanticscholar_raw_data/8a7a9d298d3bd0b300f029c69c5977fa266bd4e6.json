This research is being conducted to predict heart disorders by using available data to make predictions for the future.\u00a0The approach is carried out in several stages, such as pre-processing the data, extracting relevant features, and classifying the data. all of these steps are essential for predicting heart disease. The deep learning models is already proposed by the researches for the heart disease prediction. This work introduces a hybrid deep learning model that combines convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) to predict heart disease. The proposed model has been implemented in python, and its accuracy, precision, and recall have been evaluated.", "venue": "Indonesian Journal of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-01-01", "journal": {"name": "Indonesian Journal of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2279666434", "name": "Shubham Gupta"}, {"authorId": "2279795340", "name": "Pooja Sharma"}], "citations": []}
