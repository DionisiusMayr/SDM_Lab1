Our methodology of creating, storing and using summaries has been designed for the purpose of developing an approximate database engine that is currently deployed commercially in the area of cyber- security data analytics. However, a similar idea of approximate data processing operations can be considered also in other fields, including machine learning whereby heuristic calculations are a component of many methods. In this paper, we focus on investigation of one possible source of inaccuracy of our previ\u00acously proposed approach to approximating mutual information - that is, neglecting a kind of column domain drift during distributed summary-based computations. We illustrate it using an artificially created benchmark data set and we discuss how to cope this particular challenge in the future.", "venue": "International Symposium on High Performance Computing Systems and Applications", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2018-07-01", "journal": {"name": "2018 International Conference on High Performance Computing & Simulation (HPCS)", "pages": "852-859"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "145514740", "name": "D. \u015al\u0119zak"}, {"authorId": "144420834", "name": "J.
