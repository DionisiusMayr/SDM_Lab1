In this paper, based on the Visual Analytics framework, we present a spatiotemporal dimension reduction method based on a real world case of oil combat operation. With our prototype, we show that how dimension reduction of spatiotemporal data will improve visualisation and ease analysis.", "venue": "Oceans", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2017-09-01", "journal": {"name": "OCEANS 2017 \u2013 Anchorage", "pages": "1-8"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3133311", "name": "Ottar L.
