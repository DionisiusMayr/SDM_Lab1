Memory problems lead to excessive GC effort and out-of-memory errors, significantly hurting system performance and scalability. This paper proposes a systematic approach that can help data-parallel tasks survive memory pressure, improving their performance and scalability without needing any manual effort to tune system parameters. Our approach advocates interruptible task (ITask), a new type of data-parallel tasks that can be interrupted upon memory pressure---with part or all of their used memory reclaimed---and resumed when the pressure goes away. To support ITasks, we propose a novel programming model and a runtime system, and have instantiated them on two state-of-the-art platforms Hadoop and Hyracks. A thorough evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of ITask: it has helped real-world Hadoop programs survive 13 out-of-memory problems reported on StackOverflow; a second set of experiments with 5 already well-tuned programs in Hyracks on datasets of different sizes shows that the ITask-based versions are 1.5--3x faster and scale to 3--24x larger datasets than their regular counterparts.", "venue": "Symposium on Operating Systems Principles", "year": 2015, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2015-10-04", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 25th Symposium on Operating Systems Principles"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2153680310", "name": "Lu Fang"}, {"authorId": "2055541087", "name": "Khanh Nguyen"}, {"authorId": "38394648", "name": "G.
