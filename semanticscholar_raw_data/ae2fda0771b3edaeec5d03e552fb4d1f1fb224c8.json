The solution presented is based on extended Kalman filter using RSS coming from different transmitters in the environment. This approach was chosen because the Cellbot platform has two Wi-Fi receivers, therefore combining the two range-only sensors improves the precision of the system. The system considers that a robot navigates in an unknown environment where it receives different Wi-Fi signals from a known source. Through the odometry and Wi-Fi signals, the robot localizes itself and the position of each Wi-Fi transmitter. The results show the viability of the application, and an increase of 38% in precision of the robot pose by using proposed approach.", "venue": "IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2019-10-01", "journal": {"name": "2019 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics (SMC)", "pages": "1030-1035"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1453019776", "name": "R.
