One of the modern tools for solving this problem is the so-called data lakes. Many implementations of data lakes use Apache Hadoop as a basic platform. Hadoop does not have a default data storage format, which leads to the task of choosing a data format when designing a data processing system. To solve this problem, it is necessary to proceed from the results of the assessment according to several criteria. In turn, experimental evaluation does not always give a complete understanding of the possibilities for working with a particular data storage format. In this case, it is necessary to study the features of the format, its internal structure, recommendations for use, etc. The article describes the features of both widely used data storage formats and the currently gaining popularity.
