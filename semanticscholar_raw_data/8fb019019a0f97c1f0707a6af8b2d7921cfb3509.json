However, IoT devices have long been challenged by various vulnerabilities and pose unique security challenges compared to other devices. This paper aims to redefine the process of entering the Home IoT environment by leveraging Decentralized Identifier(DID) authentication, and proposes a comprehensive approach to using Verifiable Credential(VC) and Verifiable Presentation(VP) to control access from outsiders like visitors. Through security analysis, this paper also highlights how these authentication and permission controls address traditional vulnerabilities and provide improved security over traditional IoT authentication methods. The results of this study shed light on the significant impact this methodology can have on the security of the Home IoT environment.", "venue": "International Conference on Ubiquitous and Future Networks", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-07-04", "journal": {"name": "2023 Fourteenth International Conference on Ubiquitous and Future Networks (ICUFN)", "pages": "94-99"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2231119294", "name": "Jae-Ho Choi"}, {"authorId": "2134430856", "name": "Junhong Im"}, {"authorId": "2228333581", "name": "Hae-Jun Song"}, {"authorId": "2185056181", "name": "Ki-Hyung Kim"}], "citations": []}
