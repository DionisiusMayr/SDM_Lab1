While queries that retrieve examples based on mask properties are valuable to practitioners, existing systems do not support them efficiently. In this paper, we formalize the problem and propose MaskSearch, a system that focuses on accelerating queries over databases of image masks while guaranteeing the correctness of query results. MaskSearch leverages a novel indexing technique and an efficient filter-verification query execution framework. Experiments with our prototype show that MaskSearch, using indexes approximately 5% of the compressed data size, accelerates individual queries by up to two orders of magnitude and consistently outperforms existing methods on various multi-query workloads that simulate dataset exploration and analysis processes.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-05-03", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2305.02375"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2064928598", "name": "Dong He"}, {"authorId": "47540245", "name": "Jieyu Zhang"}, {"authorId": "102780514", "name": "Maureen Daum"}, {"authorId": "143711421", "name": "Alexander J.
