An increasing number of SASs have been proposed, requiring a comparison among them. However, existing comparisons in the literature provide a system\u2010centric view based on performance evaluations. Thus, there is a lack of comparisons based on the user\u2010centric view, that is, comparisons that help users to understand how the characteristics of SASs are useful to meet the specific requirements of their spatial applications. In this article, we provide a user\u2010centric comparison of the following SASs based on Hadoop and Spark: Hadoop\u2010GIS, SpatialHadoop, SpatialSpark, GeoSpark, GeoMesa Spark, SIMBA, LocationSpark, STARK, Magellan, SparkGIS, and Elcano. This comparison employs an extensive set of criteria related to the general characteristics of these systems, to the aspects of spatial data handling, and to the aspects inherent to distributed systems. Based on this comparison, we introduce guidelines to help users to choose an appropriate SAS. We also describe two case studies based on real\u2010world applications to illustrate the use of these guidelines. Finally, we discuss chronological tendencies related to SASs and identify limitations that SASs should address to improve user experience.", "venue": "Software, Practice & Experience", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-08-31", "journal": {"name": "Software: Practice and Experience", "pages": "2121 - 2144", "volume": "50"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "66548827", "name": "J.
