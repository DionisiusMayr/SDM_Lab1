First, we propose to extract the database information according to the submitted query keyword. Then, we establish a real-time model of distributed database demand information query and a real-time information classification model, using a distributed multivariate hash algorithm model and a query of real-time information. When there is a query keyword, the proposed method directly reads the data above the hash ring based on the keyword to improve query efficiency. Extensive experimental results indicate that our proposed method reduces the number of queries, query pressure, and processing time of information queries in the distributed database. Moreover, the distributed database\u2019s real-time processing rate and amount have increased.", "venue": "Mathematical Problems in Engineering", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-08-26", "journal": {"name": "Mathematical Problems in Engineering"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2183144198", "name": "Qingjia Luo"}], "citations": []}
