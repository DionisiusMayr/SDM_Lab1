In this work, we build an autonomous database framework and integrate our proposed learning-based database techniques into an open-source database system openGauss . We propose effective learning-based models to build learned optimizers (including learned query rewrite, learned cost/cardinality estimation, learned join order selection and physical operator selection) and learned database advisors (in-cluding self-monitoring, self-diagnosis, self-configuration, and self-optimization). We devise an effective validation model to validate the effectiveness of learned models. We build effective training data management and model management platforms to easily deploy learned models. We have evaluated our techniques on real-world datasets and the experimental results validated the effectiveness of our techniques. We also provide our learnings of deploying learning-based techniques.", "venue": "Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-07-01", "journal": {"name": "Proc.
