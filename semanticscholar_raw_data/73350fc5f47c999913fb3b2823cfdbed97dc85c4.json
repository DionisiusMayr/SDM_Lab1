Hence, the present study aims to identify the impact of using such organizers in virtual classrooms on the development of students\u2019 integrated science process skills. The present study was applied to 64 students who were studying for their Master\u2019s degree in the vocational education techniques in the \u201dResearch Project\u201d course. Participants were randomly divided into two equal experimental groups with 32 students in each. An assessment card of five main domains was used to evaluate students\u2019 skills in research procedural definition, identification and control of the research variables, questions and/or hypotheses, procedures and experimentation besides research interpretation of the results. Data analysis showed that the use of advance organizers in virtual classes was of great effect on the development of participants\u2019 integrated science process skills because skills of students in the first experimental group were better mastered than the skills of their peers in the second experimental group in accordance with the subskills in the five domains.", "venue": "PeerJ Computer Science", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-04-05", "journal": {"name": "PeerJ Computer Science"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "30774329", "name": "Abdellah Ibrahim Mohammed Elfeky"}, {"authorId": "2295420416", "name": "Ali Hassan Najmi"}, {"authorId": "2295422226", "name": "Marwa Yasien Helmy Elbyaly"}], "citations": []}
