However, state-of-the-art approaches mainly advocate either cloud-or fog-based data processing solutions, and they also lack a common framework for programming over the fog-cloud continuum. In this paper, we propose a distributed, fog-cloud data processing and orchestration framework, which is capable of exploiting the semantics of both fog platforms and the Cloud. Our framework can create on-demand process engine data flow (PEDF) spanning multiple device layers with various resource constraints. This will considerably help the developers rapidly develop and deploy data processing applications over the fog-cloud continuum. Our proposed framework is validated in a real-world scenario---IoT data streaming analytics for the smart green wall in a smart city---which demonstrates efficient resource usage and latency reduction.", "venue": "ACM Symposium on Applied Computing", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-03-22", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 36th Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "51043175", "name": "Dapeng Lan"}, {"authorId": "2146399382", "name": "Yu Liu"}, {"authorId": "2848485", "name": "Amirhosein Taherkordi"}, {"authorId": "1743900", "name": "F.
