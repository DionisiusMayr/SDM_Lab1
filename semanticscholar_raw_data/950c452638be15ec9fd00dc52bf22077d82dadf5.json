They push the storage requirements to provide suitable performance for large queries. In this paper we present the changes we made to our distributed time series database, Hawkular-Metrics, and how it stores data more effectively in the Cassandra. We show that using our methods provides significant space savings ranging from 50 to 95% reduction in storage usage, while reducing the query times by over 90% compared to the nominal approach when using Cassandra. We also provide our unique algorithm modified from Gorilla compression algorithm that we use in our solution, which provides almost three times the throughput in compression with equal compression ratio.", "venue": "", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2017-12-11", "journal": {"name": "", "volume": ""}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2549889", "name": "M.
