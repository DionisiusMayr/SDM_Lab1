A large number of Sentinel-1 SAR images have been acquired and archived, allowing for the generation of thousands of interferograms, covering millions of square kilometers. In such a large-scale interferometry scenario, many applications actually aim at monitoring localized deformation sparsely distributed in the interferogram. Thus, it is not effective to apply the time-series InSAR analysis to the whole image and identify the deformed targets from the derived velocity map. Here, we present a strategy facilitated by the deep learning networks to firstly detect the localized deformation and then carry out the time-series analysis on small interferogram patches with deformation signals. Specifically, we report following-up studies of our proposed deep learning networks for masking decorrelation areas, detecting local deformation, and unwrapping high-gradient phases. In the applications of mining-induced subsidence monitoring and slow-moving landslide detection, the presented strategy not only reduces the computation time, but also avoids the influence of large-scale tropospheric delays and unwrapping errors. The presented detection-first strategy introduces deep learning to the time-series InSAR processing chain and makes the mission of operationally monitoring localized deformation feasible and efficient for the large-scale InSAR.", "venue": "Remote Sensing", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-04-27", "journal": {"name": "Remote.
