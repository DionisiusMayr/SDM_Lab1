In such large\u2010scale, heterogeneous, and complex networks, the volume of transferred data, as big data, is considered a challenge causing different networking inefficiencies. To overcome these challenges, various techniques are introduced to monitor the performance of networks, called Network Traffic Monitoring and Analysis (NTMA). Network Traffic Prediction (NTP) is a significant subfield of NTMA which is mainly focused on predicting the future of network load and its behavior. NTP techniques can generally be realized in two ways, that is, statistical\u2010 and Machine Learning (ML)\u2010based. In this paper, we provide a study on existing NTP techniques through reviewing, investigating, and classifying the recent relevant works conducted in this field. Additionally, we discuss the challenges and future directions of NTP showing that how ML and statistical techniques can be used to solve challenges of NTP.", "venue": "Transactions on Emerging Telecommunications Technologies", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2021-11-13", "journal": {"name": "Transactions on Emerging Telecommunications Technologies", "volume": "33"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1978738974", "name": "Iraj Lohrasbinasab"}, {"authorId": "143730558", "name": "A.
