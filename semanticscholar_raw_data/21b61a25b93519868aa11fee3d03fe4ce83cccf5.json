The protection of individual privacy is the primary task for every data mining services. Privacy-based data mining process is fundamental for various services like Military applications, Banking, and Medical research. Data security is one of the significant concerns due to the high availability of individual data as well as the extensive growth of information generated in a day to day life. To guarantee the privacy of sensitive information, an OABE (Optimal Attribute-Based Encryption) scheme over big data implemented. Initially, input data clustered using the PFCM (probabilistic fuzzy c-means) algorithm. After the clustered data fed into the map-reduce framework. For optimization, the proposed method utilizes Rider Optimization Algorithm (ROA), and the proposed scheme's outcome is evaluated through clustering accuracy, error value, memory, and time. The experimental results show that our proposed scheme has achieved maximum accuracy and attains minimum information loss compared to the existing techniques.", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "144652286", "name": "Ajmeera Kiran"}, {"authorId": "2286555423", "name": "D.
