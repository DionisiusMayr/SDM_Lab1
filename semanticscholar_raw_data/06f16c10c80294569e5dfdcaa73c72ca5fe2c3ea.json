Firstly, the paper analyzes the technical characteristics of the backbone transmission network of power communication, and gives the general operation and management framework; then, the big data characteristics of basic data in the operation and management process of power communication backbone transmission network are described, and the typical big data architecture is given; finally, combined with the general operation management framework of power communication and typical big data architecture, the operation management architecture of power communication backbone transmission network is designed. The research results have reference value for the application of big data and machine learning technology in the operation and management of power communication backbone transmission network.", "venue": "Other Conferences", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2021-11-10", "journal": {"pages": "1205010 - 1205010-5", "volume": "12050"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2107944892", "name": "Shujuan Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2144156320", "name": "Lixia Zhang"}, {"authorId": "3323723", "name": "Hui-sheng Gao"}, {"authorId": "2154901458", "name": "Yang Li"}, {"authorId": "2118662607", "name": "M.
