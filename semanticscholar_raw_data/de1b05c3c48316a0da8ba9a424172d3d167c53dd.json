Advances in these systems follow different approaches, such as the integration of new protocols and standards, combination with artificial intelligence algorithms, application of big data processing methodologies, among others. These new systems and applications also should face different challenges when applying this kind of technology into health areas, such as the management of personal data sensed, integration with electronic health records, make sensing devices comfortable to wear, and achieve an accurate acquisition of the sensed data. The objective of this chapter is to present the state of the art, indicating the most current IoT trends applied to the health field, their contributions, technologies applied, and challenges faced.", "venue": "", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "1404214885", "name": "Francisco Luna-Perej\u00f3n"}, {"authorId": "1404302491", "name": "Javier Civit-Masot"}, {"authorId": "2159397523", "name": "Elena Escobar-Linero"}], "citations": []}
