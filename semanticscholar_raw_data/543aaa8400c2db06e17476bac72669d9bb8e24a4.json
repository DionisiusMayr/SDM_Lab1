In this study, we present a review of modern machine and deep learning. We provide a high-level overview for the latest advanced machine learning algorithms, applications, and frameworks. Our discussion encompasses parallel distributed learning, deep learning as well as federated learning. As a result, our work serves as an introductory text to the vast field of modern machine learning.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-12-05", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2312.03120"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2270673260", "name": "Omer Subasi"}, {"authorId": "2270673493", "name": "Oceane Bel"}, {"authorId": "2270681933", "name": "Joseph Manzano"}, {"authorId": "2269969429", "name": "Kevin Barker"}], "citations": []}
