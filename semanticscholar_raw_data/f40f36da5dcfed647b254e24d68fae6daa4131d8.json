This paper reviews research and recent trends on spatial join evaluation. The complexity of different data types, the consideration of different join predicates, the use of modern commodity hardware, and support for parallel processing open the road to a number of interesting directions for future research, some of which we outline in the paper.", "venue": "SIGSPACIAL", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2019-08-05", "journal": {"name": "ACM SIGSPATIAL Special", "pages": "13-21", "volume": "11"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2850971", "name": "Panagiotis Bouros"}, {"authorId": "1718168", "name": "N.
