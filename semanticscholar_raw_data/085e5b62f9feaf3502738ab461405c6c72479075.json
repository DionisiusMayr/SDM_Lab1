In this project, we developed a device with an uploaded edge machine learning algorithm that can detect the onset of freezing of gait symptoms in a Parkinson's patient. The algorithm achieved an accuracy of 83.7% in a validation using data from ten patients. The model was deployed in a microcontroller Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense Board model and validated in real-time operation with data streamed to the microcontroller from a computer.", "venue": "", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-11-13", "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2190751521", "name": "Purnoor Ghuman"}, {"authorId": "2190751642", "name": "Tyama Lyall"}, {"authorId": "2190751515", "name": "Usama Mahboob"}, {"authorId": "2190751433", "name": "Alia Aamir"}, {"authorId": "38284363", "name": "Xilin Liu"}], "citations": []}
