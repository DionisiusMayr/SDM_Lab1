Thus, analyzing the typical characteristics of the wind speed diurnal variation is helpful for forecasting pollutant diffusion. Based on the K-means clustering method, the diurnal variation characteristics of the wind speed in Beijing during 2008\u20132017 are studied, and the spatiotemporal characteristics of the wind speed diurnal variations are analyzed. The results show that there are mainly five to seven clusters of typical characteristics of the wind speed diurnal variation at different stations in Beijing, and the number of clusters near the city is smaller than that in the suburbs. The typical number of the wind speed diurnal variation during 2013\u20132015 is smaller than that in other periods, which means the anomalous clusters of the diurnal variation are reduced. Besides, the numbers of different clusters in different years are often switched. Especially, the switch between clusters five and six and the switch between clusters six and seven are frequent. Based on the second cluster analysis of the clustering results at the Beijing station, we find 12 clusters of the diurnal variation, including nine clusters of \u201clarge in the daytime, while small at night,\u201d two clusters of \u201cmonotonous,\u201d and one cluster of \u201cstrong wind.\u201d Furthermore, the low-speed clusters of wind mainly locate in the city with a significant increasing trend, while the high-speed clusters and the monotonous clusters of wind locate in the suburbs with a decreasing trend.", "venue": "Frontiers of Physics", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2021-06-01", "journal": {"volume": "9"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "50562123", "name": "P.
