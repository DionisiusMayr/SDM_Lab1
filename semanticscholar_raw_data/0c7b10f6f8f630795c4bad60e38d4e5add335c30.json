Outcomes beyond 3\u2009years have not been previously described. We describe the safety signals of the entire UNIFI Australian population beyond 3\u2009years.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis retrospective multicenter observational cohort study recruited from all Australian UNIFI centers. The primary outcome was safety via adverse events. Secondary outcomes included the clinical relapse rate on ustekinumab, and the need to switch from ustekinumab to an alternate agent.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere were 14 patients [11 male, mean age 47 (\u00b114) years], with a median diagnosis of 10.8 (\u00b14.5) years prior to UNIFI enrollment. Median follow-up was 298\u2009weeks (5.7\u2009years) (Interquartile range (IQR): 220-311\u2009weeks). Within the long-term extension, there were 3 serious adverse events and 1 minor event. 42.9% (6/14) patients had clinical relapses, of which clinical remission was recaptured in 83.3% (5/6). 85.7% (12/14) persisted on ustekinumab in the long-term, with 7.1% (1/14) electively ceasing ustekinumab and 7.1% (1/14) changed from ustekinumab due to clinical relapse.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nFor moderate-to-severe UC in Australia, ustekinumab maintained efficacy beyond 3\u2009years with a high persistence rate and no new safety signals.\n\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nThe trial is registered at ANZCTR (identifier: ACTRN12622001332718).", "venue": "Expert Opinion on Drug Safety", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-11-01", "journal": {"name": "Expert opinion on drug safety"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2264583731", "name": "JD.
