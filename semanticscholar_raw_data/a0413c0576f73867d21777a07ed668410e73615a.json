In particular, this work proposes a set of accelerator designs called Abakus that offer varying degrees of tradeoffs in terms of performance, efficiency, and hardware implementation complexity. The key to these designs is a set of domain-specific hardware extensions to accelerate the key operations for k-mer counting at various levels of the SSD hierarchy, with the goal of enhancing the limited computing capabilities of conventional SSDs, while exploiting the parallelism of the multi-channel, multi-way SSDs. Our evaluation suggests that Abakus can achieve 8.42 \u00d7, 6.91 \u00d7, and 2.32 \u00d7 speedup over the CPU-, GPU-, and near-data processing solutions.", "venue": "ACM Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization (TACO)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-11-21", "journal": {"name": "ACM Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3218500", "name": "Lingxi Wu"}, {"authorId": "2245386983", "name": "Minxuan Zhou"}, {"authorId": "2139549579", "name": "Weihong Xu"}, {"authorId": "1735007", "name": "A.
