However, the energy management system of these buildings has become an emerging area of research due to the rapid implementation of PV systems. The objective of this article is to propose an intelligent controller to share power generation of two PV sources for energy supply in buildings. The control is implemented using an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system. The proposed methodology is developed with two different rooftop PV systems to achieve sharing of generated power as per the load profiles. The proposed design has better utilization of PV system installed in a residential area, and the results depict the maximum utilization of solar power.", "venue": "IEEE transactions on industry applications", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2021-07-29", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications", "pages": "6327-6338", "volume": "57"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1491247264", "name": "Mohammad Jasim Usmani"}, {"authorId": "38306553", "name": "A.
