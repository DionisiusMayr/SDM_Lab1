The challenge arises because the optimal weight matrix structure in popular neural network models is obscure in most cases and may vary from layer to layer even in the same network. Prior structured matrices proposed for efficient DNNs were mostly hand-crafted without a generalized framework to systematically learn them. To address this issue, we propose a generalized and differentiable framework to learn efficient structures of weight matrices by gradient descent. We first define a new class of structured matrices that covers a wide range of structured matrices in the literature by adjusting the structural parameters. Then, the frequency-domain differentiable parameterization scheme based on the Gaussian-Dirichlet kernel is adopted to learn the structural parameters by proximal gradient descent. On the image and language tasks, our method learns efficient DNNs with structured matrices, achieving lower complexity and/or higher performance than prior approaches that employ low-rank, block-sparse, or block-low-rank matrices.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Engineering"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-10-29", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2310.18882"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2262523049", "name": "Changwoo Lee"}, {"authorId": "2262448316", "name": "Hun-Seok Kim"}], "citations": []}
