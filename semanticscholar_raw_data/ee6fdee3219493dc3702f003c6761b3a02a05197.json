Data reading by sensors is prone to errors due to various variables that the problem cannot accommodate. One method to overcome this problem is the time redundancy algorithm, where the sensor takes data and its best value several times. In this study, the sensors used to calculate the water levels are ultrasonic sensors and resistance. At the river monitoring point, data is sent using the UDP (User Datagram Protocol) protocol that previous studies have used. This research has been done as a prototype with a maximum distance between sensor nodes of one meter. The results of sending data using UDP were successful, with an average delay of 3293 microseconds. And the ultrasonic sensor that has been tested based on transient fault against time redundancy has an accuracy of 94.5% based on a sampling delay of 1000ms.", "venue": "Journal of Information Technology and Computer Science", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-04-30", "journal": {"name": "Journal of Information Technology and Computer Science"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "9718765", "name": "M.
