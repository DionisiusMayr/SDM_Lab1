Smart meters play a critical role in modern load forecasting due to the high granularity of the measurement data. Federated Learning can enable accurate residential load forecasting in a distributed manner. In this regard, to compensate for the variability of households, clustering them in groups with similar patterns can lead to more accurate forecasts. Usually, clustering requires a central server that has access to the entire dataset, which collides with the decentralized nature of federated learning. In order to complement federated learning, this study proposes a decentralized Peer-to-Peer strategy that employs agent-based modeling. We evaluate it in comparison to a typical centralized k-means clustering. To create clusters, we compare Euclidian and Dynamic time warping distances. We employ these clusters to build short-term load forecasting models using federated learning. Our results reveal the possibility of using Peer-to-Peer clustering along with simple Euclidean distances and Federated Learning to obtain highly performant load forecasting models in a fully decentralized setting.", "venue": "2023 IEEE Belgrade PowerTech", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2023-06-25", "journal": {"name": "2023 IEEE Belgrade PowerTech", "pages": "1-6"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2115310983", "name": "Joaqu\u00edn Delgado Fern\u00e1ndez"}, {"authorId": "2148494136", "name": "Sergio Potenciano Menci"}, {"authorId": "33045696", "name": "I.
