The presented analyses were made considering the possibility of their use in implementation networks and measurement and control networks used for monitoring building structures. The paper\u2019s subject was a horizontal network established on the Morasko campus (Pozna\u0144). While creating it, the practical needs and economics of measurements were taken into account. The obtained results of numerical analyzes confirmed the benefits of using the methods of estimating strengths in the equalization process, which give satisfactory results in the case of outliers.", "venue": "Civil and Environmental Engineering Reports", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2021-12-01", "journal": {"name": "Civil and Environmental Engineering Reports", "pages": "167 - 183", "volume": "31"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2151012264", "name": "Martyna Kulupa"}, {"authorId": "2151012480", "name": "Paulina Magda"}, {"authorId": "69489610", "name": "M.
