IoT cybersecurity aims to lower cybersecurity risk for businesses and users by safeguarding IoT resources and privacy. IoT security management could be improved by using new cybersecurity technology and solutions. However, efficient IoT cyber risk management frameworks are lacking for organizations. This paper presents the most significant proposals of cybersecurity in IoT by describing their objectives, working principles, applications, features, and approaches referred. The paper also presents cybersecurity in IoT using five optimization algorithms such as particle swarm optimization, ant colony optimizations, an artificial bee colony, genetic algorithm, and AdaBoost algorithm. The paper concludes with research gaps and limitations, which urge for further study for subsequent research work.", "venue": "International Conference on Contemporary Computing", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-08-03", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 2023 Fifteenth International Conference on Contemporary Computing"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2248239288", "name": "Kumar Vaibhav Bhatnagar"}, {"authorId": "21647018", "name": "Rashmi Kushwah"}], "citations": []}
