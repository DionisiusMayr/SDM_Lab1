The encryption round operation of AES algorithm is used for the encryption round operation result. Based on the encryption round operation result of AES algorithm, the secret key data matrix is generated. When data is encrypted, the data matrix is traversed at any node of the encryption end, and the key data matrix is generated again. On this basis, Zigzag permutation method is used for data transmission to complete data encryption transmission. Experimental results show that the security factor and execution efficiency of the proposed method are higher than those of traditional methods, and the energy consumption of data encryption transmission is the lowest, which indicates that the proposed method can ensure the quality of sensitive data encryption transmission in energy big data center.", "venue": "Other Conferences", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2021-12-22", "journal": {"pages": "121560M - 121560M-6", "volume": "12156"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2090028437", "name": "Rui Ma"}, {"authorId": "2115995823", "name": "Dongge Zhu"}, {"authorId": "2136137772", "name": "Jiangbo Sha"}, {"authorId": "2108773165", "name": "Jia Liu"}, {"authorId": "2029655443", "name": "Qingping Zhang"}], "citations": []}
