Hadoop as an ecosystem provides very powerful tools for working with big data. The environment itself is free, and with the availability of appropriate hardware for its installation, familiarization with such frameworks is very useful for students. This report presents the advantages and disadvantages of using Hadoop in student education and how the use of these modern environments can improve the educational process, expand the practical skills of students and prepare them for their future professional challenges in the field of processing and analysis of big data.", "venue": "International Conference on Applied Informatics", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-10-05", "journal": {"name": "2023 International Conference Automatics and Informatics (ICAI)", "pages": "470-475"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2115004618", "name": "Irena Valova"}], "citations": []}
