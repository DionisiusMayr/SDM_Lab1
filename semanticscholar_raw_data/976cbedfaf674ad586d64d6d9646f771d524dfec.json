Instead of working with tables of tuples, the query processing then operates on bubbles but leaves the traditional query processing paradigms conceptually applicable. We believe this is a natural and viable approach to render approximate query processing feasible for large data in disaggregated cloud settings or in resource-limited scenarios. Bubbles are tunable regarding the compactness of enclosed tuples as well as the granularity of statistics and the way they are instantiated. For improved accuracy, we put forward a \ufb01rst working solution that represents bubbles via Bayesian networks, per table, or along foreign-key joins. To underpin the viability of the approach, we report on an experimental evaluation considering the state-of-the- art competitors, where we show clear bene\ufb01ts when assessing the estimation accuracy, execution time, and required disk space.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-12-20", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2212.10150"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1720829503", "name": "Damjan Gjurovski"}, {"authorId": "48786878", "name": "S.
