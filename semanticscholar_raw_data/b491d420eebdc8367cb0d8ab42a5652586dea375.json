These efforts include offering subawards to collaborative research groups, financial support to graduate students for their participation in collaborative research, performing need assessment to understand the needs of the community so as to guide our project implementation, and providing data science training to enhance the data analytics skills of the RCMI investigators, staff, medical residents, and graduate students. This paper presents the progress of this project, which clearly indicates its positive impact on the local community.", "venue": "2022 International Conference on Computational Science and Computational Intelligence (CSCI)", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-12-01", "journal": {"name": "2022 International Conference on Computational Science and Computational Intelligence (CSCI)", "pages": "2143-2144"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2109183965", "name": "Qingguo Wang"}, {"authorId": "50073547", "name": "Aize Cao"}, {"authorId": "2007251024", "name": "Vibhuti Gupta"}, {"authorId": "2211195893", "name": "Ashutosh Singhal"}, {"authorId": "39254145", "name": "Todd Gary"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "90ee3db54514c8ffe7c6069d2f5b3714eb136310", "title": "ChatGPT to Enhance Learning in Dental Education at a Historically Black Medical College"}, {"paperId": "77be07da0a48072c5e03a0de08ab6d567c20ea71", "title": "ChatGPT to enhance learning in dental education at a historically black medical college"}]}
