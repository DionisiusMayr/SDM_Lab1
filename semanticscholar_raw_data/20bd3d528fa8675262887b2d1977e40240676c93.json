A Systematic Review", "abstract": "Despite a growing body of research on the smart city framework for disaster resilience, a comprehensive systematic literature review from urban planning perspectives has never been attempted. In this review of smart and resilient cities, we distill vital learning and shared concepts, identify research trends and limitations, and suggest avenues for future research. The results reveal that reviewed articles primarily focused on methodological approaches addressing how to adapt technologies for disaster resilience, yet rarely discussed the sociological approaches to environment, economy, and governance. This study will provide a reference to trace existing research and suggest equitable smart resilience.", "venue": "Journal of planning literature", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-09-05", "journal": {"name": "Journal of Planning Literature"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "119671504", "name": "Kijin Seong"}, {"authorId": "2238296416", "name": "Junfeng Jiao"}], "citations": []}
