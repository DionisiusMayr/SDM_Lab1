However, with the characteristics of mobile devices, saving energy is always a problem of study. In this study, we propose an energy-efficient routing protocol which uses a cost function integrating the hop count and the node's energy states as a metric for decision-making on route selection. Then, we evaluate the performance of the proposed protocol on NS2 simulation software version 2.34. Experimental results show that our proposed protocol increases the network lifetime, as well as the performance of the network, compare with known traditional routing protocols.", "venue": "Journal of Communications", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "J.
