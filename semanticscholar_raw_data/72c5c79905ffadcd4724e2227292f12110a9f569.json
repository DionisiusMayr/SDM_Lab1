This survey systematically assesses and classifies the state-of-the-art algorithms applied to data-driven maintenance in recent literature. The taxonomy provides a so far not existing overview and decision aid for research and practice regarding suitable AI approaches for each maintenance application. Moreover, we consider trends and further research demand in this area. Finally, a newly developed holistic maintenance framework contributes to a practice-oriented implementation of AI and considers crucial managerial aspects of an efficient maintenance system.", "venue": "ACM Computing Surveys", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-09-08", "journal": {"name": "ACM Computing Surveys", "pages": "1 - 33", "volume": "56"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2181533141", "name": "Marcel Andr\u00e9 Hoffmann"}, {"authorId": "2238213736", "name": "Rainer Lasch"}], "citations": []}
