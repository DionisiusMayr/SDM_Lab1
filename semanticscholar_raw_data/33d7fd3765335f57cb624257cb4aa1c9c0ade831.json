This research aims to assess the level of user satisfaction with the Akhlaqu Application using the System Usability Scale (SUS). The results showed a high level of usability, measured by a System Usability Scale (SUS) score of 89.7, indicating a \u201cvery good\u201d quality application that meets high usability standards. In addition, the implementation of text indexes on MongoDB has a positive impact on the speed of transaction data search, especially on complex data searches, improving the efficiency and responsiveness of the application. The implications of this research involve recommendations to continue to improve the usability and performance of the Akhlaqu Application, by maintaining the use of MongoDB index techniques as a reliable solution for optimizing the database. The study concludes that the Akhlaqu Application is an effective tool for managing students\u2019 memorization and recommends further improvements to enhance its usability and performance.", "venue": "Jurnal Sistem Informasi dan Informatika (Simika)", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-02-21", "journal": {"name": "Jurnal Sistem Informasi dan Informatika (Simika)"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2292617710", "name": "Mochammad Fauzan Fadilah"}, {"authorId": "67048863", "name": "Nining Rahaningsih"}, {"authorId": "65836898", "name": "Raditya Danar Dana"}], "citations": []}
