Apache Spark is a fast and efficient in-memory parallel-processing software framework. By retaining the data in memory, it speeds up the execution of a wide variety of applications. It maintains fault-tolerance by storing information required to recompute the data in case of failure in stable storage. However, for Big Data, recomputing large amounts of data will lead to a performance penalty. In addition, because Apache Spark runs on commodity hardware, the increased likelihood of failure strengthens the need for a fault-tolerance mechanism. In order to reduce the impact of failures on the processing of these workflows, we propose a framework called OCTWAS (Online Check-pointer for Workflows on Apache Spark). OCTWAS makes use of knowledge of how the data is used in a workflow and takes into account the gain in time obtained when the data is checkpointed at a particular stage and a failure occurs. The framework is designed to be lightweight so that the performance does not degrade when there are no failures. OCTWAS decides the check-points and writes the data to the disks at these checkpoints while the workflow is being executed. OCTWAS has been tested by simulating failures at fixed intervals. A sample workflow has been designed for Apache Spark for", "venue": "", "year": 2015, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2015-10-07", "journal": {"name": "", "volume": ""}, "authors": [{"authorId": "34468423", "name": "A.
