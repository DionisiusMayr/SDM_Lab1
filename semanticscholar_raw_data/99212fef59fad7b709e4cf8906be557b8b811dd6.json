Full benchmark suites take up to multiple hours or days to execute, rendering frequent checks, e.g., as part of continuous integration (CI), infeasible. However, altering benchmark configurations to reduce execution time without considering the impact on result quality can lead to benchmark results that are not representative of the software\u2019s true performance. We propose the first technique to dynamically stop software microbenchmark executions when their results are sufficiently stable. Our approach implements three statistical stoppage criteria and is capable of reducing Java Microbenchmark Harness (JMH) suite execution times by 48.4% to 86.0%. At the same time it retains the same result quality for 78.8% to 87.6% of the benchmarks, compared to executing the suite for the default duration. The proposed approach does not require developers to manually craft custom benchmark configurations; instead, it provides automated mechanisms for dynamic reconfiguration. Hence, making dynamic reconfiguration highly effective and efficient, potentially paving the way to inclusion of JMH microbenchmarks in CI.", "venue": "ESEC/SIGSOFT FSE", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book"], "publicationDate": "2020-11-07", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 28th ACM Joint Meeting on European Software Engineering Conference and Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "10420961", "name": "Christoph Laaber"}, {"authorId": "2008294892", "name": "Stefan W\u00fcrsten"}, {"authorId": "50355692", "name": "H.
