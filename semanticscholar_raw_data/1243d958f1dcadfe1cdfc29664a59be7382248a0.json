Massive IoT devices produce innumerable data which need to be analyzed in joint cloud computation (JointCloud) with diversified services. However, due to the weak security of IoT devices, the existing JointCloud architecture hardly provides a secure trusted trade environment for users, which affects severely the application in the IoT network. In this article, we propose a hierarchical trust networking architecture based on permissioned blockchain to implement JointCloud (HTJC). The proposed Hyperledger fabric-based architecture has a better performance than those based on Ethereum in latency. By introducing the credit bonus-penalty strategy (CBPS), HTJC can solve the trust problem and provide users with a secure trusted trade environment. The availability of the proposed architecture is evaluated and compared to the existing models. The numerical results show that the HTJC can defend distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and provide users with a trusted and effective trade platform.", "venue": "IEEE Internet of Things Journal", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-03-01", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Internet of Things Journal", "pages": "1667-1677", "volume": "7"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "145514155", "name": "Hui Yang"}, {"authorId": "49706753", "name": "Jiaqi Yuan"}, {"authorId": "1885487", "name": "Haipeng Yao"}, {"authorId": "2958128", "name": "Q.
