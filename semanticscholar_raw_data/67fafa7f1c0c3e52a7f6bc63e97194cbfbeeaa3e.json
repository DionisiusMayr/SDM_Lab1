This has affected many aspects of life, including education and learning. Education 5.0 refers to the fifth industrial revolution in education by leveraging digital technologies to eliminate barriers to learning, enhance learning methods, and promote overall well-being. The concept of Education 5.0 represents a new paradigm in the field of education, one that is focused on creating a learner-centric environment that leverages the latest technologies and teaching methods. This paper explores the key requirements of Education 5.0 and the enabling technologies that make it possible, including artificial intelligence, blockchain, and virtual and augmented reality. We analyze the potential impact of these technologies on the future of education, including their ability to improve personalization, increase engagement, and provide greater access to education. Additionally, we examine the challenges and ethical considerations associated with Education 5.0 and propose strategies for addressing these issues. Finally, we offer insights into future directions for the development of Education 5.0, including the need for ongoing research, collaboration, and innovation in the field. Overall, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of Education 5.0, its requirements, enabling technologies, and future directions, and highlights the potential of this new paradigm to transform education and improve learning outcomes for students.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-07-29", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2307.15846"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2109858467", "name": "Shabir Ahmad"}, {"authorId": "51980106", "name": "Sabina Umirzakova"}, {"authorId": "2203426330", "name": "Ghulam Mujtaba"}, {"authorId": "2217300240", "name": "M.
