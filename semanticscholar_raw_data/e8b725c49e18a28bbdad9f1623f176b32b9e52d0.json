In this paper, we propose a middleware that primarily focuses on (1) non-invasively integrating Velox into the TinkerPop framework to provide unified vectorized engine acceleration for all graph databases supporting the TinkerPop specification; (2) conducting graph queries based on the relational data storage model, eliminating the overhead of transforming the storage model into a graph storage model; (3) validating the acceleration effect of the vectorized engine on interactive workload of graph queries under a single-node environment.", "venue": "2023 3rd International Conference on Electronic Information Engineering and Computer (EIECT)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-11-17", "journal": {"name": "2023 3rd International Conference on Electronic Information Engineering and Computer (EIECT)", "pages": "318-322"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2288110030", "name": "Zihao Li"}, {"authorId": "2267149200", "name": "Liyang Xu"}, {"authorId": "2287942331", "name": "Ruochun Jin"}, {"authorId": "2289301115", "name": "Huan Chen"}, {"authorId": "2170489673", "name": "Yuhua Tang"}], "citations": []}
