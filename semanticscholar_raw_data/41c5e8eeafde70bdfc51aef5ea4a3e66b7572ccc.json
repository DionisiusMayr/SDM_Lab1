In this visionary paper, we embark on a comprehensive exploration of representative architectures to address the requirement. We highlight three pivotal paradigms: The state-of-the-artDL-Centricarchitecture offloadsDL computations to dedicated DL frameworks. The potential UDF-Centric architecture encapsulates one or more tensor computations into User Defined Functions (UDFs) within the database system. The potentialRelation-Centricarchitecture aims to represent a large-scale tensor computation through relational operators. While each of these architectures demonstrates promise in specific use scenarios, we identify urgent requirements for seamless integration of these architectures and the middle ground between these architectures. We delve into the gaps that impede the integration and explore innovative strategies to close them. We present a pathway to establish a novel database system for enabling a broad class of data-intensive DL inference applications.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-10-07", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2310.04696"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2256989979", "name": "Alexandre Eichenberger"}, {"authorId": "2256983700", "name": "Qi Lin"}, {"authorId": "2256983271", "name": "Saif Masood"}, {"authorId": "2263978478", "name": "Hong Min"}, {"authorId": "2165305224", "name": "Alexander Sim"}, {"authorId": "2257249774", "name": "Jie Wang"}, {"authorId": "2257112757", "name": "Yida Wang"}, {"authorId": "2238407326", "name": "Kesheng Wu"}, {"authorId": "2257005360", "name": "Binhang Yuan"}, {"authorId": "1995831806", "name": "Lixi Zhou"}, {"authorId": "2237786723", "name": "Jia Zou"}], "citations": []}
