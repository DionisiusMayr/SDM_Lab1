It can be achieved by using heuristic or meta-heuristic optimization techniques. Many techniques have been developed for cloud workload management and scheduling. However, a combination of both the approaches has received far less attention in previous work. A hybrid technique can improve the performance of the system by selecting the best resources from the available ones. This paper proposes a Hybrid Approach for Cloud Load Balancing (HA-CLB) using a combination of heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms for workflow scheduling to reduce makespan and cost while improving the resource utilization.", "venue": "2022 2nd International Conference on Advance Computing and Innovative Technologies in Engineering (ICACITE)", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-04-28", "journal": {"name": "2022 2nd International Conference on Advance Computing and Innovative Technologies in Engineering (ICACITE)", "pages": "548-552"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2176920035", "name": "Suman Lata"}, {"authorId": "144178916", "name": "Dheerendra Singh"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "8f527c550233f2cb7a2a7e18c85f9411087968ee", "title": "A review on dynamic load balancing algorithms"}]}
