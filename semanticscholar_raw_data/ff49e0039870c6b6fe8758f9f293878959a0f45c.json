However, processing large amounts of data imposes a computing power barrier for practical application. Machine learning\u2010assisted self\u2010powered sensors based on TENG have been widely used in data\u2010driven applications due to their excellent characteristics such as no additional power supply, high sensing accuracy, low cost, and good biocompatibility. This work comprehensively reviews the latest progress in machine learning (ML)\u2010assisted TENG\u2010based sensors. The future challenges and opportunities are discussed. First, the fundamental principles including the working mode of ML\u2010assisted TENG\u2010based sensor and common algorithms are systematically and comprehensively illustrated, which emphasizes the algorithm definition and principle. Subsequently, the progress of ML methods in the field of TENG\u2010based sensors is further reviewed, summarizing the advantages and disadvantages of various algorithms in practical examples, and providing guidance and suggestions on how to choose the appropriate methods. Finally, the prospects and challenges of ML\u2010assisted TENG\u2010based sensors is summarized. Directions and important insights for the future development of TENG and AI integration is provided.", "venue": "Advanced Materials & Technologies", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2024-02-06", "journal": {"name": "Advanced Materials Technologies"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2202079604", "name": "Ruzhi Shang"}, {"authorId": "2138726739", "name": "Huamin Chen"}, {"authorId": "2149649363", "name": "Xu Cai"}, {"authorId": "2274923634", "name": "Xin Shi"}, {"authorId": "2283511319", "name": "Yanhui Yang"}, {"authorId": "2283448316", "name": "Xuan Wei"}, {"authorId": "2283353254", "name": "Jun Wang"}, {"authorId": "2145128581", "name": "Yun Xu"}], "citations": []}
