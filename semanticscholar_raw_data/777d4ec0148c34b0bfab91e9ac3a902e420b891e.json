One key factor in improving the performance of LLMs is alignment with humans achieved with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), as for many LLMs such as GPT-4, Bard, etc. In addition, recent studies are investigating the replacement of human feedback with feedback from other LLMs named Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF). We examine the biases that come along with evaluating LLMs with other LLMs and take a closer look into verbosity bias -- a bias where LLMs sometimes prefer more verbose answers even if they have similar qualities. We see that in our problem setting, GPT-4 prefers longer answers more than humans. We also propose a metric to measure this bias.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-10-16", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2310.10076"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2258786071", "name": "Keita Saito"}, {"authorId": "41036308", "name": "Akifumi Wachi"}, {"authorId": "2007365532", "name": "Koki Wataoka"}, {"authorId": "2258718252", "name": "Youhei Akimoto"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "aae01e933690e1f060b8bc5e3ecbef785630d0f9", "title": "Aligning with Human Judgement: The Role of Pairwise Preference in Large Language Model Evaluators"}, {"paperId": "e53aa81923958e8e247bb9d09250b8ccf0848513", "title": "Arithmetic Control of LLMs for Diverse User Preferences: Directional Preference Alignment with Multi-Objective Rewards"}, {"paperId": "f3748aea92332bc999527deef2971370bcb5010d", "title": "Shai: A large language model for asset management"}, {"paperId": "7a9ac0618daeccca047592f9ca85f1e27c10fb70", "title": "Large language models can enhance persuasion through linguistic feature alignment"}, {"paperId": "b931b242f40a032b9ae7dae9d9fc10c6ab90695e", "title": "Peering Through Preferences: Unraveling Feedback Acquisition for Aligning Large Language Models"}]}
