These big data repositories are generated from web systems built on top of big datasets, as in several real-life examples such as web interfaces to social networks, e-government systems, smart city tools (e.g., for weather forecasting), and so forth. The problem of extracting actionable knowledge insights from big web knowledge bases is a relevant challenge at now. In line with this emerging research field, the paper proposes models, issues and research trends in the context of multidimensional big data analytics over big web knowledge bases, along with a reference architecture that impersonates this paradigm.", "venue": "IEEE International Conference on Multimedia Big Data", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-12-01", "journal": {"name": "2022 IEEE Eighth International Conference on Multimedia Big Data (BigMM)", "pages": "1-6"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "145046124", "name": "A.
