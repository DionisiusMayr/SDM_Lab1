Deep learning methods are used for load forecasting with different devices for smart grids in advanced metering infrastructure (AMI). Scattered and large amounts of energy consumption data are used for information and communication technologies (ICT) using centralized model training. Therefore, federated learning (FL) shares weights without transmitting data. However, FL requires enough operation time to train multiple nodes. The proposed method in this study used a Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) framework which is lower-cost FL operations on the visual interface. With this method, developers can implement FL conveniently. The experimental results showed that only a small amount of code writing was required to obtain the training results. This greatly reduced the communication cost and computation complexity and improved the efficiency of retraining and code deployment. The productivity of operation, then, can be reduced significantly.", "venue": "2023 IEEE 5th Eurasia Conference on IOT, Communication and Engineering (ECICE)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-10-27", "journal": {"name": "2023 IEEE 5th Eurasia Conference on IOT, Communication and Engineering (ECICE)", "pages": "284-289"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2145303044", "name": "Huan Chen"}, {"authorId": "2279240562", "name": "Chi-Ting Liu"}, {"authorId": "2279223129", "name": "Hsin-Yao Hsu"}, {"authorId": "150148683", "name": "Jia-You Hsieh"}], "citations": []}
