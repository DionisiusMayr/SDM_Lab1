The mushrooming of IoT devices and usage is increasing day by day. Huge amount of data will be generated by these connected devices. Thus, there is an indispensable need to process such heavy volume of data in a quick and efficient manner. In request to meet the above standards. In this paper the research challenges of fog and Edge computing, the role of fog computing in IoT, the working model and benefits of edge computing are given in a novel approach after a detailed review, study and scrutiny. This enables and paves way to the researcher for a smoother and sustainable research scope in the fog and edge computing environment.", "venue": "2022 4th International Conference on Smart Systems and Inventive Technology (ICSSIT)", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-01-20", "journal": {"name": "2022 4th International Conference on Smart Systems and Inventive Technology (ICSSIT)", "pages": "18-21"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2285450696", "name": "V.Sindhu Assistant Professor"}, {"authorId": "147846773", "name": "P.
