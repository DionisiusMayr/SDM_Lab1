Enterprises are recently adopting a multi store system with combined use of Bigdata stores and RDBMS. Bigdata stores are used for exploratory queries and gathering business insights. RDBMS is used for business reporting. Though, Multi storage systems improves the query processing capability by executing it over multiple stores it is challenging to optimize the query execution considering queries on both structured and unstructured data for big data analytics. This work surveys the existing methods for query optimization in multi storage systems. The objective is to identify the challenges and shortcoming in the existing methods on query optimization over multi data stores.", "venue": "2022 2nd Asian Conference on Innovation in Technology (ASIANCON)", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-08-26", "journal": {"name": "2022 2nd Asian Conference on Innovation in Technology (ASIANCON)", "pages": "1-5"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2187599630", "name": "Radha R"}, {"authorId": "2187599831", "name": "Selvarani R"}], "citations": []}
