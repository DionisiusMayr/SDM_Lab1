Various factors of natural conditions, especially the absolute height of the relief, slope, aspect, horizontal and vertical fragmentation, have been widely studied since the 20th century. Nowadays, these factors are studied through geographic information technologies, on the basis of satellite images and Remote Sensing materials. Therefore, our research is dedicated to the actual topic. We also conducted analyses based on modern methods in the Great Caucasus natural region, which is our research area. At this time, we have analyzed the absolute height of the relief, aspect and inclination of the slopes using the Digital Elevation Model of the area. As a result of the conducted researches, we have determined that desert and semi-desert landscapes were formed in areas with low absolute height and inclination, and forest, alpine, subalpine, nival and subnival landscapes were formed in areas with high absolute height and inclination. Forests are mostly found on the northern slopes, and semi-desert and desert landscapes are widespread on the southern slopes.", "venue": "Proceedings of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-02-29", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2280222693", "name": "A.
