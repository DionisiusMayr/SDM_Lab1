Computer Vision (CV) has recently achieved signi\ufb01cant improvements, thanks to the evolution of deep learning. Along with advanced architectures and optimisations of deep neural networks, CV data for (cross-datasets) training, validating, and testing contributes greatly to the performance of CV models. Many CV datasets have been created for di\ufb00erent tasks, but they are available in heterogeneous data formats and semantic representations. Therefore, it is challenging when one needs to combine di\ufb00erent datasets either for training or testing purposes. This paper proposes a uni\ufb01ed framework using the Semantic Web technology that provides a novel way to interlink and integrate labelled data across di\ufb00erent data sources. We demonstrate its advantages via various scenarios with the system framework accessible both online and via APIs. 4", "venue": "International Workshop on the Semantic Web", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "144936086", "name": "A.
