These days, every sector like Industry, education, hospitals, companies and devices like IOT and Sensors are generating huge amount of data in the order of terabytes, petabytes, yottabytes etc. It is a difficult task to store and analyze the data using traditional RDMS and programming languages. Storing and analyzing big data requires special tools to process the data in an effective manner. Hadoop is one such tool to store and process big data in an efficient way. Map Reduce is a programming model under Hadoop framework which processes the data using < key, value> pairs. But the difficulty level of the programming in the Map Reduce approach, users needs another easy and effective solution to handle big data. Hive is such a solution that processes large amounts the structured data. The environment and commands of hive provide facility to the users easy and flexible query interaction of analyzing big data. But the problem associated with hive is lack of optimization of queries. In this paper, initially, we formulate the approach of map reducer for analyzing big data then discuss problems and difficulty associated with the map reducers. We then discuss implementation and evaluation of Hive queries and then how to create Hive tables with optimized. The results are evaluated using Hadoop Ubuntu Virtual Machine.", "venue": "", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "67057981", "name": "K.
