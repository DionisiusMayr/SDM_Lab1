The existing solutions are highly multidisciplinary security embedded, but still, there are openings to solve the upcoming Hadoop technology like Apache Ozone which is scalable, redundant, and more importantly a distributed object storage for Hadoop. With the growing information and technology, the volume of data traffic is transmitted over storage that requires extensive security measures and privacy in the environment of big data. In this paper, we describe our efforts towards the traditional way of securing the data and compare different methods to secure the data in Hadoop technology and suggested an optimum solution.", "venue": "2020 Global Conference on Wireless and Optical Technologies (GCWOT)", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2020-10-06", "journal": {"name": "2020 Global Conference on Wireless and Optical Technologies (GCWOT)", "pages": "1-6"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2069491775", "name": "Shiraz Ali Wagan"}, {"authorId": "2059667745", "name": "M.
