As a consequence, it is dif\ufb01cult to select the right allocations for storage backends when moving data-heavy applications to the cloud. Mimir is a tool for automatically \ufb01nding a cost-ef\ufb01cient virtual storage cluster (VSC) con\ufb01guration for a customer\u2019s storage workload and performance requirements. Importantly, since no single allocation type is best for all workloads, Mimir considers all allocation types and even heterogeneous mixes of them. In our experiments, compared to state-of-the-art approaches that consider only one allocation type, Mimir \ufb01nds VSC con\ufb01gurations that reduce cost by up to 81% for substantial storage workloads.
