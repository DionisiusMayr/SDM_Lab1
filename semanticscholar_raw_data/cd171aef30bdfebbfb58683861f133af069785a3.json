This is due to the difficulty of having a high-performance scheduler that optimizes cost and time while meeting the demands of the users. In this research, we propose a new Parametric Scheduling Algorithm (PSA) that, depending on the user's needs, reduces the monetary cost, the execution time, or both simultaneously. Our suggested algorithm is based on the Slime Mould Algorithm (SMA) with some modifications and improvements. The WorkflowSim simulator is utilized to compare the performance of our proposed system with the Genetic Algorithm, which is widely used to handle workflow scheduling problems, and the original Slim Mould Algorithm. The simulation results show that our suggested PSA algorithm outperforms the other algorithms.", "venue": "2022 International Symposium on iNnovative Informatics of Biskra (ISNIB)", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-12-07", "journal": {"name": "2022 International Symposium on iNnovative Informatics of Biskra (ISNIB)", "pages": "1-6"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2003211179", "name": "Sarra Hammouti"}, {"authorId": "9420113", "name": "Belabbas Yagoubi"}, {"authorId": "2213388331", "name": "Sid Ahmed Makhlouf"}], "citations": []}
