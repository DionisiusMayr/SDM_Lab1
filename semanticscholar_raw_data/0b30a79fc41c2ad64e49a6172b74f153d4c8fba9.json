Apache Hadoop has emerged as a leading framework for storing and processing Big Data in a timely fashion. Hadoop is used in various sectors that often include private and sensitive data, which must be protected from unauthorized access. This paper proposes a new access control model called the Role-Attribute Based Access Control for Hadoop, referred to as H-RABAC, which inherits full advantages of RBAC and ABAC models. This hybrid model enforces access control policies dynamically based on user roles and data attributes. We further outline the necessary modi\ufb01cation to XACML authorization policies to meet the security and privacy needs of Hadoop. In addition, we present a real-world use case and application of the H-RABAC model in the banking domain, followed by experimental results that show that the overhead imposed by our framework is minimal and acceptable for enforcing access control policies and protecting sensitive data in Hadoop.", "venue": "", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "65820337", "name": "Hafsa Ait Idar"}, {"authorId": "9218544", "name": "H.
