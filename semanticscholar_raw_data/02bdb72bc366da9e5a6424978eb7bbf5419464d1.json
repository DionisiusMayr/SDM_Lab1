The data set related to this, mainly open source databases, is a rapidly changing data set, so its analysis only shows the current state, but if the data set is large enough and considered mass data, it may be suitable for drawing new connections and conclusions for the future. A geospatial analysis system applicable to security geographic analysis is under development, which is continuously collecting data by taking predefined variables into account for a specific area of interest. The geospatial crisis index can be obtained from these local data following a professional analysis procedure based on predefined algorithms. This new index is a unitless numerical value issued by the geospatial evaluation and analysis system used to analyse crisis zones. It is a benchmark allowing areas to be compared in terms of a fixed risk factor or factors to be ranked in a hierarchy by fixing the area. This helps shape the order of the analysis, speeds up the actual text and map evaluation, reduces the need for human resources, and supports commanders in decision-making.", "venue": "", "year": null, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2287581880", "name": "P\u00e9ter Balog"}], "citations": []}
