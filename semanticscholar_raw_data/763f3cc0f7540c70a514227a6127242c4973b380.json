However, the privacy concerns introduced by individualized activity recognition may counteract potential benefits. As an example, consider a public health official gauging their message\u2019s efficacy. Machine learning and data mining methods may help them understand how their local population\u2019s behavior changes, but aggressive surveillance can severely hinder individual privacy and cause disproportionate harm to disadvantaged groups. In this work, we benchmark a series of machine learning algorithms predicting high-risk behaviors\u2014going to bars and gyms, attending parties, and riding on buses\u2014given only low-level smartphone sensor data. We find that models trained to perform these challenging tasks are largely unreliable and should be avoided in practice, though their predictions are significantly better than random.", "venue": "", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "32452740", "name": "Thomas Hartvigsen"}], "citations": []}
