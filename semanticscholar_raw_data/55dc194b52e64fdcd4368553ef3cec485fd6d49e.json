However, this shift was so sudden and drastic that unrevealed puzzles exist regarding the public\u2019s authentic opinion towards online classes, even though three years have passed. Many experts and policymakers have conducted qualitative and quantitative research to explore effective pedagogies, the satisfaction of different stakeholders, and factors influential on learners\u2019 performance. However, scant studies have examined personal opinions and concerns toward online classes hidden behind people\u2019s anonymous posts on social media. This research investigates the sentiments, concerns, and their variance with time regarding online classes by learners and educators on Reddit, which is a dominant social network among them. Data were collected via the official API from identified relevant subreddits and keyword search results across Reddit. Sentiment analysis was applied to reveal their emotions and their changes. Topic modeling was conducted to discover the concerns hidden in the posts. The results revealed the concerns about online classes, such as severe cheating behaviors, and showed doubts about previous strategies to solve disadvantages in online classes. In addition, the results verified the habitual difference and motivations of social media usage between educators and learners.", "venue": "Applied Sciences", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2023-02-09", "journal": {"name": "Applied Sciences"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2205362427", "name": "Shanghao Li"}, {"authorId": "2205343957", "name": "Zerong Xie"}, {"authorId": "2058851364", "name": "Dickson K.
