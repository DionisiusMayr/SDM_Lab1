Firstly, we designed a data page structure for row-column hybrid storage based on HDFS. Then we proposed and implemented an adaptive lightweight data compression strategy based on MapReduce to compress and store data as the proposed storage structure. Finally, we provided a query strategy which directly execute on the compressed data of the given storage structure. The experiments conducted on the large-scale datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed strategy on reducing the amount of storage and improving query performance for structured data.", "venue": "2015 Third International Conference on Digital Information, Networking, and Wireless Communications (DINWC)", "year": 2015, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2015-03-05", "journal": {"name": "2015 Third International Conference on Digital Information, Networking, and Wireless Communications (DINWC)", "pages": "160-164"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1982034", "name": "Xiangwu Ding"}, {"authorId": "2064522699", "name": "B.
