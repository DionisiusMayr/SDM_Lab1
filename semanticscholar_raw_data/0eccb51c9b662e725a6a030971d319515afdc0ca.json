In this work, we are focusing on stream processing and reasoning using the graph-based RDF data model. We are aiming to explore the ability of modern distributed computing frameworks to process highly expressive knowledge inference queries over Big Data streams. To do so, we consider queries expressed as a positive fragment of a temporal logic framework based on Answer Set Programming and propose solutions to process such queries, based on the two main execution models adopted by major parallel and distributed execution frameworks: Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP) and Recordat-A-Time (RAT). We implement our solution named BigSR and conduct a series of experiments with 15 queries from 4 different datasets. Our experiments show that BigSR achieves high throughput beyond million-triples per second using a rather small cluster of machines.", "venue": "2018 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2018-12-01", "journal": {"name": "2018 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "pages": "811-820"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3464627", "name": "Xiangnan Ren"}, {"authorId": "2141773", "name": "Olivier Cur\u00e9"}, {"authorId": "3045686", "name": "Hubert Naacke"}, {"authorId": "47490276", "name": "Guohui Xiao"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "eb518f48e9424884c99ac35f98f104f32c4037fc", "title": "ZodiacEdge: a Datalog Engine With Incremental Rule Set Maintenance"}, {"paperId": "b17716bafe30d11e6588b2cb5c08627d6b521fe1", "title": "Context-aware query derivation for IoT data streams with DIVIDE enabling privacy by design"}, {"paperId": "1885d5a5550729790cb98ab76bcf14d8e3f0f929", "title": "A Formal Comparison between Datalog-based Languages for Stream Reasoning"}, {"paperId": "7283fb3ce0e9a51e56e9768d7f6ca275c827b7b6", "title": "I-DLV-sr: A Stream Reasoning System based on I-DLV"}, {"paperId": "57bae65367a828ce46872bf316fcd7c5eca24152", "title": "DSCEP: An Infrastructure for Decentralized Semantic Complex Event Processing"}, {"paperId": "f2b70ccb3fe0b5e3325b5c0c42595098bf77c4ef", "title": "DSCEP: An Infrastructure for Distributed Semantic Complex Event Processing"}, {"paperId": "fe657e5d12b6508d779bc5bc19e12a234395227e", "title": "Gestion de m\u00e9ga-donn\u00e9es : passage \u00e0 l'\u00e9chelle et qualit\u00e9 pour divers cas d'usage.
