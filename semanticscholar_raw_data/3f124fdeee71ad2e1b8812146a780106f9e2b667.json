The study used descriptive methods. It focuses on finding the main potential parameters that effect the concentration of CO2 emissions based on energy resources in Italy. Sequential Minimal Optimization regression (SMOreg), Linear Regression, and Simple Linear Regression are used. Based on the analysis, the Liquid Fuel sector has had the highest rate of increase in CO2 emission 56.8%. R. Linear Regression algorithm gives us a better performance of the prediction for the CO2 emissions than the second algorithm Simple Linear Regression. These results are in line with the present condition in Italy due to the Italian National Program on Climate Change which focuses on reducing carbon dioxide emissions.", "venue": "M\u00fchendislik Bilimleri ve Ara\u015ft\u0131rmalar\u0131 Dergisi", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Environmental Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2021-02-08", "journal": {"name": "M\u00fchendislik Bilimleri ve Ara\u015ft\u0131rmalar\u0131 Dergisi"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2101055079", "name": "Saleh Y.
