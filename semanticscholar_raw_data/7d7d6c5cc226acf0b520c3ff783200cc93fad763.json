Ubiquitous surveillance is also a precondition for most dystopian societies, both real and fictional. How our personal data is processed and consumed in an ever more connected world must imperatively be made transparent, and more effective technical solutions than those currently on offer, to manage personal data must urgently be investigated.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2019-03-30", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/1904.00156"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3176695", "name": "Thomas Pasquier"}, {"authorId": "1784358", "name": "D.
