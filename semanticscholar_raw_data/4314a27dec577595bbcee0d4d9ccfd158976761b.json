Cybercrimes, data security breaches and privacy violations reflect voracity and represent the dark side of the Big Data ecosystem. Losing the confidentiality, integrity or availability of data because of a data security breach poses threat to IC and value creation. Thus, cyberthreats compromise the social value of Big Data, impacting on stakeholders\u2019 and society\u2019s interests.\n\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nBecause of the interpretative nature of this study, other researchers may not draw the same conclusions from the evidence provided. It leaves some open questions for a wide research agenda about the societal, ethical and managerial implications of Big Data.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThis paper introduces the risks of data security and the challenges of Big Data to stimulate new research paths for IC and accounting research.\n", "venue": "Meditari Accountancy Research", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2018-07-30", "journal": {"name": "Meditari Accountancy Research"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "122988786", "name": "Matteo La Torre"}, {"authorId": "33272905", "name": "John Dumay"}, {"authorId": "51044941", "name": "M.
