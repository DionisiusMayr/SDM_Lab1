This data is opening new scientific and commercial investigations in fields such as pollution monitoring and patient health monitoring. Parallel to this development, deep learning has matured into a powerful analytics technique to support these investigations. However, computing and resource requirements of deep learning remain a challenge, often forcing analysis to be carried at remote third-party data centers. In this paper, we describe an alternative computing as a service model where available smart devices opportunistically form micro-data centers that can support deep learning-based investigations of data streams generated by sensors. Our model enables smart homes, smart buildings, smart offices, and other types of smart spaces to become providers of powerful computation as a service, enabling edge analytics, and other applications that require pervasive (in-space) decisioning.", "venue": "IEEE pervasive computing", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2019-07-01", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Pervasive Computing", "pages": "40-48", "volume": "18"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2120346", "name": "Eemil Lagerspetz"}, {"authorId": "51217525", "name": "Jonatan Hamberg"}, {"authorId": "2153899655", "name": "Xin Li"}, {"authorId": "2533364", "name": "Huber Flores"}, {"authorId": "2583077", "name": "Petteri Nurmi"}, {"authorId": "144396244", "name": "N.
