However, despite the rapid advancement of low-power communication technologies, the deployment of IoT networks still faces many challenges. In this article, we propose a hybrid, low-power, wide-area network (LPWAN) structure that can achieve wide-area communication coverage and low-power consumption on IoT devices by utilizing both sub-GHz long-range radio and 2.4-GHz short-range radio. Specifically, we constructed a low-power mesh network with LoRa, a physical-layer standard that can provide long-range (kilometers) point-to-point communication using custom time-division multiple access (TDMA). Furthermore, we extended the capabilities of the mesh network by enabling ANT, an ultralow-power, short-range communication protocol to satisfy data collection in dense device deployments. Third, we demonstrate the performance of the hybrid network with two real-world deployments at the Purdue University campus and at the university-owned farm. The results suggest that both networks have superior advantages in terms of cost, coverage, and power consumption vis-\u00e0-vis other IoT solutions, like LoRaWAN.", "venue": "IEEE Internet of Things Journal", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-06-22", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Internet of Things Journal", "pages": "901-915", "volume": "8"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1557288165", "name": "Xiaofan Jiang"}, {"authorId": null, "name": "Heng zhang"}, {"authorId": "19231229", "name": "E.
