All these applications require reasoning about the relevance of facts in a KG to downstream applications. In this work, we describe our efforts in building a solution to reason about the importance of facts over continuously updated industry-scale KGs. We focus on the problem of fact ranking and evaluate to what extent modern knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models provide a representation for addressing this problem. To this end, we discuss unique challenges associated with solving this task in industrial settings and evaluate how accurately different KGE models and text-based embedding models can solve the problem of fact ranking.", "venue": "", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "40046694", "name": "Hongyu Ren"}, {"authorId": "143661472", "name": "A.
