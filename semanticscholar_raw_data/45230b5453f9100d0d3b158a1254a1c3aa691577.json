This survey paper explores the integration of AI within the OR process (AI4OR) to enhance its effectiveness and efficiency across multiple stages, such as parameter generation, model formulation, and model optimization. By providing a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art and examining the potential of AI to transform OR, this paper aims to inspire further research and innovation in the development of AI-enhanced OR methods and tools. The synergy between AI and OR is poised to drive significant advancements and novel solutions in a multitude of domains, ultimately leading to more effective and efficient decision-making.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2024-01-06", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2401.03244"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2279279797", "name": "Zhenan Fan"}, {"authorId": "1821932", "name": "Bissan Ghaddar"}, {"authorId": "2278609744", "name": "Xinglu Wang"}, {"authorId": "2278433905", "name": "Linzi Xing"}, {"authorId": "2278652068", "name": "Yong Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2243665091", "name": "Zirui Zhou"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "6c78bf485367b4cf0968504a0595550e65389327", "title": "From Large Language Models and Optimization to Decision Optimization CoPilot: A Research Manifesto"}]}
