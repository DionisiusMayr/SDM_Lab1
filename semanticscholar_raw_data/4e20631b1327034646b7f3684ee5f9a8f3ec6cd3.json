However, existing metadata catalog solutions have limitations, such as being domain-specific or using document-oriented databases that limit their scalability and flexibility. To address these issues, we introduce the Airavata Data Catalog - a multi-tenanted schema-free metadata catalog service that supports multiple domain-specific metadata schemas and access control mechanisms. This paper describes our approach to modeling the relational attributes of data products and their access control while supporting a schema-free, document-oriented approach to storing and searching metadata. Our approach offers significant improvements over existing solutions and demonstrates the feasibility of a scalable, flexible metadata catalog for scientific datasets.", "venue": "Practice and Experience in Advanced Research Computing", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book"], "publicationDate": "2023-07-23", "journal": {"name": "Practice and Experience in Advanced Research Computing"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "38153888", "name": "Marcus A.
