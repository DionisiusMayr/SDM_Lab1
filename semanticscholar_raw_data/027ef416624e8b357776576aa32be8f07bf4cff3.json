There is a need to analyze this data efficiently and produce results quickly. Data science offers a formal methodology for processing and analyzing data. The goal of processing and analyzing data is to produce actionable insights from this data. The insight gathered from the data enables individuals and businesses to make informed and important decisions. Data science involves a workflow with multiple stages, such as data collection, data wrangling, statistical analysis, and machine learning. The first part of this thesis evaluates data analytics systems that support the data science work-flow by introducing a data science benchmark, Sanzu. Further, we believe that data analysts and scientists would want to use a single system that can perform both data analysis tasks and SQL querying, without requiring data movement between different systems. Ideally, this system would have adequate performance, scalability, built-in data analysis functionality, and usability. Currently, relational databases and big data frameworks are used for SQL querying and complex data analysis respec-", "venue": "", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "", "volume": ""}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2114412139", "name": "A.
