To this end, this paper proposes a self-supervised learning scheme inspired by the self-correction and interpretability provided by a standard TM. The proposed architecture uses a twin of Label-Critic Tsetlin Automata (TAs). The Label-TA learns the individual samples\u2019 correct labels guided by a self-corrected TM logical clause. At the same time, the Critic-TA validates the learning and approves the Label-TA reward. Our empirical results on synthetic and real data show promising capabilities for self-supervised learning and interpretable clustering. Furthermore, the Label-Critic TM architecture demonstrates how propositional logic-based learning provides self-correction with the absence of the ground truths in data.", "venue": "2022 International Symposium on the Tsetlin Machine (ISTM)", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-06-01", "journal": {"name": "2022 International Symposium on the Tsetlin Machine (ISTM)", "pages": "41-48"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "30850620", "name": "Ahmed Abouzeid"}, {"authorId": "2493161", "name": "Ole-Christoffer Granmo"}, {"authorId": "49052946", "name": "Morten Goodwin"}, {"authorId": "70185984", "name": "C.
