The authors have shown that for the formation of the software and hardware infrastructure of a digital storage of spatial data, it is advisable to follow an organized technological process. At the same time, spatial data warehouses should provide system integration of data with spatial and temporal reference. The solution to the problems of visualization and dissemination of spatial data should be based on the effective use of geoportal systems. It is concluded that the development of databases of digital SDIs and geoportal systems is associated with the development of methods and algorithms for the conjugate analysis of the peculiarities of the interaction of natural, social and production systems, complex interpretation of large arrays of spatial data and forecasting the development of natural and natural-man-made processes.", "venue": "E3S Web of Conferences", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "E3S Web of Conferences"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "52351251", "name": "A.
