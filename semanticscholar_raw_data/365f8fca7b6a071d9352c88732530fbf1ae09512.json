The data and related APIs provided to the virtual reality application are based on a separate web application which provides REST APIs in order to get and further manipulate existent data. The algorithm pipeline is managed by using the Unity Game Engine, which provides a means to express control and logic over the sensory inputs of the Leap Motion controller. The application is built by using the Unity Game Engine and it is streamed on any Android phone through RiftCat Vridge software solution for streaming application over WiFi, while interpreting the phone\u2019s sensor input and translating it into virtual head movements. The issues from the standpoint of a corporate need for a more interactive and natural experience in viewing and interacting with big data.
