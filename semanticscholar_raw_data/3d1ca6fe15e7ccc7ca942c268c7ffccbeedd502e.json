The proposed method includes an indexing method for effective retrieval in addition to the parallel ingestion method of spatiotemporal data. In this paper, a dynamic multilevel grid index scheme is proposed to maximize parallelism and to adapt to the skewed spatiotemporal data. Finally, through experiments in a cluster environment, it is shown that the ingestion and query throughput increase as the number of nodes increases.", "venue": "Applied Sciences", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2019-10-11", "journal": {"name": "Applied Sciences"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2107883430", "name": "Sangdeok Park"}, {"authorId": "120493097", "name": "Daesik Ko"}, {"authorId": "1703191", "name": "Seokil Song"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "b5647bb207ed49c0fd7dc391e03f23f90026b70f", "title": "Exploiting hashing for concurrent query processing and indexing of current location of moving objects"}, {"paperId": "1d21c82c7452d5860f233950f43a67418ca90775", "title": "Performance Comparison of Big Data Processing Utilizing SciDB and Apache Accumulo Databases"}, {"paperId": "8ddcbb5084b73097b2d605fdc23a0d38dba4a942", "title": "Knowledge Discovery Web Service for Spatial Data Infrastructures"}, {"paperId": "7605fb39bd40b9c8fd420f059b7d82846a36d6e0", "title": "A Space-Interconnection Algorithm for Satellite Constellation Based on Spatial Grid Model"}, {"paperId": "f3662eb1dee000dbc11cecae8b5f59997fa34232", "title": "SwapQt: Cloud-based in-memory indexing of dynamic spatial data"}]}
