Then comes the problem of network security, privacy theft, malicious attacks and other illegal acts still exist, a qualified software system will log the key operation behavior of the software. Therefore, log analysis has become an important means of anomaly detection. Based on log analysis, this paper consulted the related literature on anomaly detection, elaborated the research status of anomaly detection based on log analysis from the aspects of template matching, rule self-generation and outlier analysis, and analyzed the challenges faced by anomaly detection based on log analysis.", "venue": "International Journal of Advanced Network, Monitoring, and Controls", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Geology"], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2020-01-01", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Advanced Network, Monitoring and Controls", "pages": "40 - 49", "volume": "5"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "30697337", "name": "Xu-Kang Wu"}], "citations": []}
