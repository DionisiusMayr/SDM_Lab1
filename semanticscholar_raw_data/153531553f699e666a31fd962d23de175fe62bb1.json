Tehri, a region in the Himalayas is no different. Current research aids in the construction of ensemble models of DLNN and SVM, which are then compared with various SVM kernels. Landslide susceptibility mapping in the Tehri region of the Himalayas has been worked upon using a deep learning (DLNN), four machine learnings (SVM-RBF, SVM-Linear, SVM-Polynomial, SVM-Sigmoid), and their novel ensembles i.e., DLNN with SVM-RBF, DLNN with SVM-Linear, DLNN with SVM-Polynomial and DLNN with SVM-Sigmoid. 16 geo-environmental landslide conditioning factors (LCFs) have been considered. These models were trained using 70% of inventory landslides and tested using 30% of the same. The results revealed the superiority of DLNN, DLNN-SVM (RBF), DLNN-SVM (Linear) models which quantified 28.32, 26.96 and 22.41% of the area highly susceptible for landslide, respectively.", "venue": "Geocarto International", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-09-02", "journal": {"name": "Geocarto International", "pages": "17018 - 17043", "volume": "37"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "79392261", "name": "S.
