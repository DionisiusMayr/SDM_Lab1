Manual compliance with these requests is error-prone and imposes costly burdens especially on smaller organizations, as non-compliance risks steep \ufb01nes. K9db is a new, MySQL-compatible database that complies with privacy laws by construction. The key idea is to make the data ownership and sharing semantics explicit in the storage system. This requires K9db to capture and enforce applications\u2019 complex data ownership and sharing semantics, but in exchange simpli\ufb01es privacy compliance. Using a small set of schema annotations, K9db infers storage organization, generates procedures for data retrieval and deletion, and reports compliance errors if an application risks violating the GDPR. Our K9db prototype successfully expresses the data sharing semantics of real web applications, and guides developers to getting privacy compliance right. K9db also matches or exceeds the performance of existing storage systems, at the cost of a modest increase in state size.", "venue": "", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2286651278", "name": "Kinan Dak"}, {"authorId": "2286633183", "name": "Ishan Albab"}, {"authorId": "2286563007", "name": "Justus Sharma"}, {"authorId": "2286592378", "name": "Benjamin Adam"}, {"authorId": "2286651403", "name": "Aaron Kilimnik"}, {"authorId": "2286354116", "name": "Jeyaraj Raj"}, {"authorId": "2286561244", "name": "Artem Paul"}, {"authorId": "2286622428", "name": "Leonhard Agvanian"}, {"authorId": "2286603220", "name": "Spiegelberg Malte"}, {"authorId": "2286651281", "name": "Schwarzkopf"}, {"authorId": "2286602621", "name": "Albab Ishan"}, {"authorId": "2286623676", "name": "Sharma Justus"}, {"authorId": "2286651405", "name": "Adam Benjamin Kilimnik"}, {"authorId": "101168553", "name": "Aaron R.
