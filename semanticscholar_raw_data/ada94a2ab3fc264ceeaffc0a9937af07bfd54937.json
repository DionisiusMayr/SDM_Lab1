Some design choices in the engine, especially those concerning streaming of intermediate results, can result in suboptimal executions for query patterns that have common expressions. In this paper we build upon recent work and introduce new optimizations in Athena that handle some common expression scenarios without materializing intermediate results or duplicating work. We describe commonalities and differences with previous work, and provide experimental results that validate our approach on TPC-DS data.", "venue": "IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-05-01", "journal": {"name": "2022 IEEE 38th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE)", "pages": "1610-1620"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2362833", "name": "Nicolas Bruno"}, {"authorId": "2180288942", "name": "Johnny Debrodt"}, {"authorId": "2116334776", "name": "Chujun Song"}, {"authorId": "2152412921", "name": "Wei Zheng"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "6d892169ba8ad60cbc1d127d8b3c74cbe9ba7237", "title": "Query Rewriting via Large Language Models"}, {"paperId": "8424c68702ad3852378ca95ea4deb68785dca763", "title": "Using Cloud Functions as Accelerator for Elastic Data Analytics"}, {"paperId": "9c9a6a89396be6b1faa808df108b10f0bb2b65ec", "title": "Predictive Price-Performance Optimization for Serverless Query Processing"}]}
