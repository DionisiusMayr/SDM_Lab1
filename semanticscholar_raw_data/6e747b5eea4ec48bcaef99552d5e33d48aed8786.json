Simulation is one of the major tools for assessing coordination mechanisms (e.g. intersection control), especially when considering autonomous vehicles. This study proposes a simulation framework for researching MAS-based coordination mechanisms. The framework includes three main components for accurately replicating the scenario, namely a traffic simulator for modeling vehicle dynamics and interactions, a network simulator modeling vehicular networks and a BDI-based agent simulator for modeling cognitive decision-making abilities. We perform a preliminary analysis of the framework to assess its capability to cope with average complexity coordination mechanisms in connected and autonomous vehicle settings.", "venue": "2023 IEEE 26th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-09-24", "journal": {"name": "2023 IEEE 26th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)", "pages": "6158-6164"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2284081868", "name": "Francisco Filipe"}, {"authorId": "2854736", "name": "Zafeiris Kokkinogenis"}, {"authorId": "1397510083", "name": "P.
