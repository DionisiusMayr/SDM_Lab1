In view of the low level of exploitation of this wealth, the State of Cameroon has committed since 2010 to the redevelopment of sites, access roads and places of recreation. For an effective and efficient dissemination of its tourism offer, a webmapping application was implemented in 2012. However, it could not be published due to a number of shortcomings, in particular the use of a mono scale map at 1: 500,000 and the lack of interactivity with the map. In this article we propose an improved version of this application and through a software development process, a new platform has been implemented and allows on the OSM multi-scale basemap, interactive access to tourism offers on Cameroon in providing descriptive information and illustrative photos on request.", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2021-01-02", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Innovation and Applied Studies", "pages": "882-890", "volume": "31"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2123146887", "name": "Clarice Fotso"}, {"authorId": "2123147896", "name": "C\u00e9sar Senoua"}, {"authorId": "2100157723", "name": "L.
