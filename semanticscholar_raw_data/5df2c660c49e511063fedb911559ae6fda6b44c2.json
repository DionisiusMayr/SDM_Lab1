There are different platforms available, in which cyber-attacks are performed, data servers one of the most laid-back targets. Due to these attacks users important information leaked such as personal documents and other private documents. Due to this problem researchers are focused on secure and privacy preserved image transmission system, in which images are send to cloud server in encrypted form and avoid the privacy linking problems in cloud services. There are different types of services provide by cloud IaaS, PaaS and,SaaS all required a trustful and secure method for the encryption of users data. In this survey paper discuss the different privacy preserving methods in Image Cloud, also compare these methods. In the last decade different methods was presented, in this survey discuss few of them. Most of the methods are focused on data security; few of them focus on privacy preservation. Also discuss the major issues of privacy preserving in clouds.", "venue": "International Journal of Scientific Research in Science and Technology", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-10-01", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Scientific Research in Science and Technology"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2266538088", "name": "Priyanka Valmiki"}, {"authorId": "2265866698", "name": "Dr. Arvind Kaurav"}, {"authorId": "2265869768", "name": "Prof. Nehul Mathur"}], "citations": []}
