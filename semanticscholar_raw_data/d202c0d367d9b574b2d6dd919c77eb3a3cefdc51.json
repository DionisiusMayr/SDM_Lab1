In this column, we propose a set of desirable properties of such algorithms and use this as a guide for surveying results from the authors\u2019 recent papers published in PODS 2023, IJCAI 2023, and Inf. Proc. Letters 2024. In particular, we explain and compare several concrete fitting algorithms, and we discuss complexity and size bounds for constructing fitting CQs with desirable properties.", "venue": "", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2018-06-01", "journal": {"name": "Sigmod Record", "pages": "3-4", "volume": "47"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2178387374", "name": "Juliana Freire"}, {"authorId": "1743316", "name": "Ihab F.
