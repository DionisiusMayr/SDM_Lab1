When a smart building is commissioned there is no historical data that could be used to train these algorithms. On-line Re-inforcement Learning (RL) algorithms have shown signi\ufb01cant promise, but their deployment carries a signi\ufb01cant risk, because as the RL agent initially explores its action space it could cause signi\ufb01cant discomfort to the building residents. In this paper we present ReLBOT, a new technique that uses transfer learning in conjunction with deep RL to transfer knowledge from an existing, optimized smart building, to the newly commissioning building, to reduce the adverse impact of the reinforcement learning agent\u2019s warm-up period. We demonstrate improvements of up to 6.2 times in the duration, and up to 132 times in prediction variance for the reinforcement learning agent\u2019s warm-up period.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2305.00365"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2027316023", "name": "Mikhail Genkin"}, {"authorId": "145788042", "name": "J.
