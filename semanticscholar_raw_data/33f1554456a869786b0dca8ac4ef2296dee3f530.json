Yet, how legislatures use new technology to enhance their oversight of government is neglected in the existing literature. This study developed a framework of information capacity to explain how big data technology could contribute to stronger legislative budget oversight in China. The authors select Guangzhou as a case and found that the online budget supervision system in Guangzhou provided an opportunity for local people\u2019s congresses in China to improve both their efficiency and effectiveness despite their lack of expertise and time. All things considered, the accountability of the entire budgeting system is being improved. However, China\u2019s case may not be copied elsewhere. The use of big data technology requires a favourable environment and various resources. Both technological advances and behavioural change are likely to take a long time to accomplish.", "venue": "Asia Pacific Journal of Public Administration", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2020-10-01", "journal": {"name": "Asia Pacific Journal of Public Administration", "pages": "274 - 289", "volume": "42"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "145259314", "name": "Meili Niu"}, {"authorId": "79396701", "name": "Muhua Lin"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "f7eb85f74a735f8c898ddfd9d5210774907fb587", "title": "\u201cBeneficial Owners\u201d Policy: Comparison of Its Efficacy in the West with Prospects for Curbing Corruption in China"}, {"paperId": "0817f11d39b83077ddeed12d67755c73767d1c19", "title": "Smart Energy Trend Observation"}]}
