The emergence of 5G technology will witness a further surge in the growth of IoT across the world but simultaneously security concerns pertinent to the IoT technology also need rigorous evaluations. This article will present a thorough survey of the security challenges in an IoT network, recent cases of attacks on IoT technology, communication protocols prevalent in IoT systems and the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in IoT security. For the first time, all the major attributes related to IoT security along with potential solutions using AI are reviewed and articulated together. This work would act as a useful resource for understanding useful perspectives in future research focused around the development of more secured IoT communication protocols as well as AI tools for handling privacy and security in IoT.", "venue": "Security and Privacy", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-11-09", "journal": {"name": "Security and Privacy", "volume": "6"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2063967586", "name": "Ali K.
