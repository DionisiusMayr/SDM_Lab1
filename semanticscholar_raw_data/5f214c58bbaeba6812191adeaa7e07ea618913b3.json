For IDSVM to be deployed in embedded systems, moving window architecture is needed to limit the number of support vectors in the model. This increases the complexity of the system as data need to be unlearned while learning new data. This work proposes an interleaved IDSVM (IIDSVM) architecture that performs incremental and decremental learning simultaneously. This work targets embedded system platform with limited on-chip memory. The proposed solution is able to get an improvement of 60% \u2013 70% in terms of speed while producing similar accuracy with IDSVM.", "venue": "International Symposium on Circuits and Systems", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2019-05-01", "journal": {"name": "2019 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)", "pages": "1-5"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3289143", "name": "Jeevan Sirkunan"}, {"authorId": "1401354701", "name": "N.
