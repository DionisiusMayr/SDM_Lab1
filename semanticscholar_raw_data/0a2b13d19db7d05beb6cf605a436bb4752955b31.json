Such layering introduces significant performance and management costs. In this paper we propose a single system called Pangea that can manage all data---both intermediate and long-lived data, and their buffer/caching, data placement optimization, and failure recovery---all in one monolithic distributed storage system, without any layering. We present a detailed performance evaluation of Pangea and show that its performance compares favorably with several widely used layered systems such as Spark.", "venue": "Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2018-08-18", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/1808.06094"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "144551417", "name": "Jia Zou"}, {"authorId": "144239384", "name": "A.
