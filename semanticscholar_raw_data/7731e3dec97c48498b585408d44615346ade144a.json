We extend this type of study by employing BERT to characterize variation in the senses of words as well, analyzing two months of English comments in 474 Reddit communities. The specificity of different sense clusters to a community, combined with the specificity of a community\u2019s unique word types, is used to identify cases where a social group\u2019s language deviates from the norm. We validate our metrics using user-created glossaries and draw on sociolinguistic theories to connect language variation with trends in community behavior. We find that communities with highly distinctive language are medium-sized, and their loyal and highly engaged users interact in dense networks.", "venue": "Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-02-12", "journal": {"name": "Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics", "pages": "538-556", "volume": "9"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "15983089", "name": "Li Lucy"}, {"authorId": "2168134", "name": "David Bamman"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "5465f9e89bbdf3090d3e4ca793723a56098347db", "title": "Toward Informal Language Processing: Knowledge of Slang in Large Language Models"}, {"paperId": "3c448b8dbd00d459e4b5b861302a2ce2398faa7c", "title": "Semantic change and socio-semantic variation: the case of COVID-related neologisms on Reddit"}, {"paperId": "4339ca216cbe904e760f1feb20219bc6e876c648", "title": "Polysemy and the sociolinguistics of policy ideas: resilience, sustainability and wellbeing 2000\u20132020"}, {"paperId": "30b7406cc05dc6cac3241af826d535eec56c37f8", "title": "DisCGen: A Framework for Discourse-Informed Counterspeech Generation"}, {"paperId": "f26c2685000da2bb2acc647819ac65c8270d2089", "title": "Social Meme-ing: Measuring Linguistic Variation in Memes"}, {"paperId": "a1d0425b05010feca795c70c023b14ccaa01f093", "title": "Sentiment Analysis in Digital Spaces: An Overview of Reviews"}, {"paperId": "46d0a5495cee7181e0aca5dfcffe409f6856a274", "title": "Syntactic Variation Across the Grammar: Modelling a Complex Adaptive System"}, {"paperId": "464770587aece80cc9e3451050058e30c2aa6666", "title": "Scaling Expert Language Models with Unsupervised Domain Discovery"}, {"paperId": "80901cab5dbe8f193a197540d407f3dad999c797", "title": "Words as Gatekeepers: Measuring Discipline-specific Terms and Meanings in Scholarly Publications"}, {"paperId": "7f5801f8036e71658a12d16203617b2ab25ef14f", "title": "Discovering Differences in the Representation of People using Contextualized Semantic Axes"}, {"paperId": "6243c8f4d426e368b8ccbc8a7fb396438488dc99", "title": "Tracing Semantic Variation in Slang"}, {"paperId": "b64f5f422979576796c34bc8999c53efafac5856", "title": "Stability of Syntactic Dialect Classification over Space and Time"}, {"paperId": "f113216e0c31c4aa343533bc4c4f6f669fb44b22", "title": "Geolocation of multiple sociolinguistic markers in Buenos Aires"}, {"paperId": "8b3a67c7e5289eed160d2acfd04d71cfb552c67d", "title": "Branch-Train-Merge: Embarrassingly Parallel Training of Expert Language Models"}, {"paperId": "7ae4508eb6334a9cfea24a28f95dfa03dc87df7e", "title": "What company do words keep?
