It was found through repeated observations that when animals were fed fermentable fibers, they were prevented from steatosis induced by a high-fat diet, probably because propionate when absorbed from the portal vein, can alter hepatic metabolic processes to reduce lipid content (15). In addition, it has been found that propionate may reduce atherosclerosis through immune-dependent regulation of intestinal cholesterol metabolism (16). Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, as a progressive form of NAFLD, is marked by inflammation and hepatocellular damage (17).
