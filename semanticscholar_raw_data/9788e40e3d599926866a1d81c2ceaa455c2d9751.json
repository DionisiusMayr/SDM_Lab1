Such computations pose great challenges to both system builders and theoreticians: first, to derive simple yet powerful abstractions for these computations; second, to define and study the semantics for the abstractions; third, to devise optimization techniques for these computations. In recent work we presented a generalization of Datalog called Datalog, which addresses these challenges. Datalog is a simple abstraction, which allows aggregates to be interleaved with recursion, and retains much of the simplicity and elegance of Datalog. We define its formal semantics based on an algebraic structure called Partially Ordered Pre-Semirings, and illustrate through several examples how Datalog can be used for a variety of applications. Finally, we describe a new optimization rule for Datalog, called the FGH-rule, then illustrate the FGH-rule on several examples, including a simple magic-set rewriting, generalized semi-na\u00efve evaluation, and a bill-of-material example, and briefly discuss the implementation of the FGH-rule and present some experimental validation of its effectiveness.", "venue": "SIGMOD record", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-07-29", "journal": {"name": "ACM SIGMOD Record", "pages": "6 - 17", "volume": "51"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "31117574", "name": "Mahmoud Abo Khamis"}, {"authorId": "2117428126", "name": "RelationalAI"}, {"authorId": "144655602", "name": "H.
