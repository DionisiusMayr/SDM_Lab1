The collected data consists of various factors which are based on demographic characteristic, satisfaction of service and purchasing behavior of the customers. The dissection of customer purchasing behavior is analyzed using frequencyand monetaryattributes of RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis. Analyzed results help supermarkets to uncover the purchasing behavior of customer. Local supermarkets use this information to establish them in a better manner by fine-tuning their marketing strategies to incorporate the customer\u2019s expectation and behavior. For arriving at this segmentation, we use a Soft Clustering method based on Expectation Maximization (EM) clustering approach. Because of this reason that the hard clustering reveals less promising results; the proposed Soft Clustering can be used more effectively than finite mixture model and we also incorporate a hard clustering method based on K-means. A comparison is made with the soft clustering method for evaluating the performance of these algorithms. Our result shows that K-means Clustering algorithm performs efficiently than EM Clustering algorithm.", "venue": "", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2084365170", "name": "G.
