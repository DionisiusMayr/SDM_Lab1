In this article, aiming to explore the security impact from the emerging and anarchistic IoT systems, we survey the state of the art of the security and privacy issues in the smart IoT world from a networking perspective. We predict that IoT systems will be extensively used by hackers to commit malicious actions given the features of IoT devices and systems. We also discuss the privacy issue caused by IoT systems. Finally, we present our understanding of counterattacks from both the application and theoretical aspects. We hope this article will shed light on the research field for interested readers.", "venue": "IEEE Communications Magazine", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2018-09-01", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Communications Magazine", "pages": "14-18", "volume": "56"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1409936228", "name": "Shui Yu"}, {"authorId": "39749807", "name": "Guojun Wang"}, {"authorId": "2110776796", "name": "Xiting Liu"}, {"authorId": "144254699", "name": "J.
