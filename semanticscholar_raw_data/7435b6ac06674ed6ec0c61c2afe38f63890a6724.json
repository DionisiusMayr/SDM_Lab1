Sensor-enabled smartphones make Human Activity Recognition progressively significant and well known. The physical sensors, gyroscope and accelerometer combinedly allow the devices to provide motion measuring capabilities in a more accurate manner. The present research work adopts a machine learning based approach for recognizing activity on the basis of data collected through the smartphone sensors (accelerometer and gyroscope). Various state-of-the-art machine learning based techniques have been employed and compared on the basis of the performance metrics, accuracy, recall, precision, and the F1-score. Of all the selected different machine learning classifiers, the best result is given by the Support Vector Machine (SVM) with \u2018RBF\u2019 kernel, which achieved an accuracy of 96.61 % in classifying the activities into the six different classes.", "venue": "2020 Sixth International Conference on Parallel, Distributed and Grid Computing (PDGC)", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2020-11-06", "journal": {"name": "2020 Sixth International Conference on Parallel, Distributed and Grid Computing (PDGC)", "pages": "167-171"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2054749858", "name": "Umra Khan"}, {"authorId": "40656843", "name": "S.
