The data of the whole life cycle of plate parts is the research object combined with research status. The characteristics and functions of the text data pool are analysed. The framework of the text data pool for plate parts is constructed. The text data pool for intelligent manufacturing of plate parts is designed. A Hadoop platform is built by using Java, hive and other components. And the modules are built to achieve text data pool data fusion. A large number of data generated in the process of plate parts design and intelligent manufacturing can be analysed, processed and extracted more clearly, such as data collection, data format conversion, text disambiguation and other fusion functions, so as to achieve the purpose of data processing. These researches not only play an important role in data storage and processing, but also improve the efficiency and accuracy of plate parts design and intelligent manufacturing.", "venue": "Journal of Physics: Conference Series", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Physics"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2020-06-01", "journal": {"name": "Journal of Physics: Conference Series", "volume": "1575"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1712225334", "name": "Guangrong Li"}, {"authorId": "104080254", "name": "Yuanguo Cao"}, {"authorId": "143767129", "name": "Sufang Zhao"}, {"authorId": "102734566", "name": "Yongqiang Bao"}, {"authorId": "2110960820", "name": "Chao Yu"}], "citations": []}
