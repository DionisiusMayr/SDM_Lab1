This method makes effective use of the region overlap between queries and the region aggregation of query sets. By clustering the query set, we divide some queries with high similarity into a group, and share a materialized view within the group, which can effectively reduce the overhead of the query set. The experimental results show that, the method proposed in this paper is superior to the traditional method. It can shorten the time of queries.", "venue": "", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2018-03-01", "journal": {"name": "", "volume": ""}, "authors": [{"authorId": "49013210", "name": "Pei Fei"}, {"authorId": "2109062767", "name": "Cai Chen"}, {"authorId": "2119122552", "name": "Yi Liang"}], "citations": []}
