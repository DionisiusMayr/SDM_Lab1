The large\u2010scale and complexity of these applications need the efficient management of data in relations. Hence, Datalog implementations require new data structures for managing relations that (1) are parallel, (2) are highly specialized for Datalog evaluation, and (3) can accommodate different workloads depending on the applications concerning memory consumption and computational efficiency. In this article, we present a data structure framework for relations that is specialized for shared\u2010memory parallel Datalog implementations such as the souffl\u00e9 Datalog compiler. The data structure framework permits a portfolio of different data structures depending on the workload. We also introduce two concrete parallel data structures for relations, designed for various workloads. Our benchmarks demonstrate a speed\u2010up of up to 6\u00d7 by using a portfolio of data structures compared with using a B\u2010tree alone, showing the advantage of our data structure framework.", "venue": "Concurrency and Computation", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-01-07", "journal": {"name": "Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience", "volume": "34"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "32809463", "name": "Herbert Jordan"}, {"authorId": "2672375", "name": "Pavle Suboti\u0107"}, {"authorId": "48805779", "name": "David Zhao"}, {"authorId": "144650318", "name": "Bernhard Scholz"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "428d0ae6be2e3e5146c2ca166fc7e64848929297", "title": "Finding Cross-rule Optimization Bugs in Datalog Engines"}, {"paperId": "95637d34079d3c4ca5bd35c57e0dc1c46ce8c493", "title": "Flan: An Expressive and Efficient Datalog Compiler for Program Analysis"}, {"paperId": "2b24030b5aa6ad601380ffc3aca63124511df48d", "title": "Bring Your Own Data Structures to Datalog"}, {"paperId": "1cc6f37d58ffc2a3771a148b083a6a0dc6aadc46", "title": "An efficient interpreter for Datalog by de-specializing relations"}]}
