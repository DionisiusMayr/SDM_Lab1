Attacks using low performance devices, the application of new technologies and data analysis to infer private data, lack of development in some aspects of security offer a wide field for improvement. The advent of Semantic Technologies for IoT offers a new set of possibilities and challenges, like data markets, aggregators, processors and search engines, which rise the need for security. New regulations, such as GDPR, also call for novel approaches on data-security, covering personal data. In this work, we present DS4IoT, a data-security ontology for IoT, which covers the representation of data-security concepts with the novel approach of doing so from the perspective of data and introducing some new concepts such as regulations, certifications and provenance, to classical concepts such as access control methods and authentication mechanisms. In the process we followed ontological methodologies, as well as semantic web best practices, resulting in an ontology to serve as a common vocabulary for data annotation that not only distinguishes itself from previous works by its bottom-up approach, but covers new, current and interesting concepts of data-security, favouring implicit over explicit knowledge representation. Finally, this work is validated by proof of concept, by mapping the DS4IoT ontology to the NGSI-LD data model, in the frame of the IoTCrawler EU project.", "venue": "Italian National Conference on Sensors", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-02-01", "journal": {"name": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "volume": "20"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1398599779", "name": "Pedro Gonzalez-Gil"}, {"authorId": "82178699", "name": "J.
