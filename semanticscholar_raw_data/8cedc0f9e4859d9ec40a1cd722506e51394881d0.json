However, this can cause new security vulnerabilities. In particular, V2X communication, to provide the safety of connected cars, can directly threaten the lives of passengers if a security attack occurs. For V2X communication security, standards such as IEEE 1609.2 define the technical functions that digital signature and encryption to provide security of V2X messages. However, it is difficult to verify the security technology by applying it to the environment with real roads because it can be made up of other safety accidents. In addition, vehicle simulation R&D is steadily being carried out, but there is no simulation that evaluates security for the V2X application level. Therefore, in this paper, a virtual machine was used to implement a V2X communication simulation environment that satisfies the requirements for the security evaluation of connected cars. Then, we proposed scenarios for cybersecurity testing and evaluation, implemented and verified through CANoe Option.Car2X. Through this, it is possible to perform sufficient preliminary verification to minimize the variables before verifying security technology in a real road environment.", "venue": "Italian National Conference on Sensors", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-01-27", "journal": {"name": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "volume": "23"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "51503994", "name": "Dae-Hwi Lee"}, {"authorId": "2203824004", "name": "Chan-Min Kim"}, {"authorId": "2112926551", "name": "Hyun-Seok Song"}, {"authorId": "2203735130", "name": "Yong-Hee Lee"}, {"authorId": "98745726", "name": "W.
