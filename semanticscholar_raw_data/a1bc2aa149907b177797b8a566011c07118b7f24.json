Therefore, how to reduce the redundancy between similar data and reduce the amount of data transmission is the current data analysis of the IoT perception layer. Data security testing for sensor networks in IoT environments is the major topic of this paper. The sensor nodes in the monitoring area can collect and further process the relevant environmental information data, and then establish the routing in the form of the single-hop or multi-hop to transmit the data information to the convergence node or the base station. This is a complex scenario and the efficient security testing toll is essential. In the designed model, the high-performance management nodes can greatly improve the performance of the system.The smart contract, the core logic part of the model, is designed using multi-level thinking. For the testing tool, Metasploit penetration attack platform is applied. The simulation proves the performance.", "venue": "2023 7th International Conference on I-SMAC (IoT in Social, Mobile, Analytics and Cloud) (I-SMAC)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-10-11", "journal": {"name": "2023 7th International Conference on I-SMAC (IoT in Social, Mobile, Analytics and Cloud) (I-SMAC)", "pages": "116-121"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2261951679", "name": "Weiwei Lang"}], "citations": []}
