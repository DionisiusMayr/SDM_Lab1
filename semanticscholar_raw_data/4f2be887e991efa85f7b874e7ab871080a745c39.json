However, it is impossible to query other data modalities, such as images, text, or video stored in modern data systems such as data lakes using these query planners. In this paper, we propose Language-Model-Driven Query Planning, a new paradigm of query planning that uses Language Models to translate natural language queries into executable query plans. Different from relational query planners, the resulting query plans can contain complex operators that are able to process arbitrary modalities. As part of this paper, we present a first GPT-4 based prototype called CEASURA and show the general feasibility of this idea on two datasets. Finally, we discuss several ideas to improve the query planning capabilities of today's Language Models.", "venue": "Conference on Innovative Data Systems Research", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-08-07", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2308.03424"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2067522077", "name": "Matthias Urban"}, {"authorId": "2691974", "name": "Carsten Binnig"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "286f6a75d6f2e9654b4d9f04bcceb4616bdbad8c", "title": "No more optimization rules: LLM-enabled policy-based multi-modal query optimizer"}]}
