This effect causes a buildup of heat in cities, mostly due to anthropogenic heat, the limiting of redistribution of heat due to the geometry of cities, and excess solar radiation captured by roads and buildings. To investigate the extent of the Urban Heat Island in Enschede, the Municipality of Enschede has enlisted the help of students and researchers at the University of Twente to build a network of sensors to measure and monitor the problem. \nThis graduation project focuses on using this sensor network to create a system that presents the temperature data, so that conclusions can be made about the extent of the problem. Research was done into possible ways of presenting the data, which lead to the creation of multiple concepts. The final system was a data visualization web application consisting of a map visualization with a heatmap, along with a line chart to display historic data. \nThe system was evaluated with multiple test users and stakeholders, and met many of the requirements. However, due to a lack of time, the system could not be connected to a database with measurements, instead it used an external data file. Many improvements still must be made to the system, however if the Urban Heat Island is a problem for the citizens of Enschede, it will be observable through these visualizations of data.", "venue": "", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "", "volume": ""}, "authors": [{"authorId": "82332573", "name": "A.
