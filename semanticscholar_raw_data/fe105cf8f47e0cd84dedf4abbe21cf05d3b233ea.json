It also highlights TCCM of big data and KM research through which it integrates a few previously reported themes and suggests some new themes.Research limitations/implicationsThis study extends advances in the previous reviews by adding a new time line, identifying new themes and helping in the understanding of complex and emerging field of linkage between big data and KM. The study outlines a holistic view of the research area and suggests future directions for flourishing in this research area.Practical implicationsThis study highlights the role of big data in KM context resulting in enhancement of organizational performance and efficiency. A summary of existing literature and future avenues in this direction will help, guide and motivate managers to think beyond traditional data and incorporate big data into organizational knowledge infrastructure in order to get competitive advantage.Originality/valueTo the best of authors\u2019 knowledge, the present study is the first study to go deeper into understanding of big data and KM research using bibliometric and TCCM analysis and thus adds a new theoretical perspective to existing literature.", "venue": "Benchmarking : An International Journal", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2024-03-29", "journal": {"name": "Benchmarking: An International Journal"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2054713183", "name": "A.
