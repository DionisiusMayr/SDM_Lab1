To satisfy this increasing demand, modern server and high-performance computing systems are increasingly deploying nodes with greater heterogeneity and integration. Both trends reduce the cost of computation: heterogeneity by increasing absolute performance, and integration by reducing cost per computation. What has not changed, however, are the stringent reliability, availability, and serviceability (RAS) requirements for nodes used in server and high-performance computing systems. A high level of RAS is required to ensure that data centers deploying nodes can correctly perform computations over their expected lifetime.This paper describes the increased RAS challenges posed by increased heterogeneity and integration. The paper motivates these challenges using data gathered from production systems and presents a case study of the RAS implementation on a highly integrated, heterogeneous node: the AMD EPYC\u2122 and AMD Instinct\u2122 MI250X heterogeneous compute node. Finally, the paper provides a call for standardization to aid in meeting these goals for future data centers.", "venue": "IEEE International Reliability Physics Symposium", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-03-01", "journal": {"name": "2022 IEEE International Reliability Physics Symposium (IRPS)", "pages": "2C.4-1-2C.4-8"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2990049", "name": "Majed Valad Beigi"}, {"authorId": "1729676", "name": "S.
