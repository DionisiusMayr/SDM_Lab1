It patches existing business process models rather than rebuilds models from scratch, which saves efforts and reacts to unforeseen changes quickly. However, the original annotation-based approach is at risk of improper annotations added that results in unexpected effects or leads to failure. To remedy this loophole, this paper proposes a syntax-directed annotation approach to guarantee sound reactions. we develop a scheme for designing domain specific languages based on abstract syntax trees and generating a syntax-directed editor automatically. As a result, all patched annotations on the process models are soundness guaranteed in terms of the domain specific language. Case studies demonstrate that proposed approach and tools can help domain experts to tackle long-tailed changes more easily guarantee the correct reactions.", "venue": "International Conference on Service Science", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2020-08-01", "journal": {"name": "2020 International Conference on Service Science (ICSS)", "pages": "162-169"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "49221582", "name": "Hongmei Cao"}, {"authorId": "2145307975", "name": "Xi Chen"}, {"authorId": "2146645257", "name": "Liang Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2146032", "name": "Tiange Zhang"}, {"authorId": "28844838", "name": "Xiaochun Xiao"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "d7244e9a0e9f86f3abf40c8913366caeeaf74877", "title": "Improving Business Process Resilience to Long-tailed Business Events via Low-code"}, {"paperId": "96915686ed3c0b06420e375c3c29bc96e041b4de", "title": "Fulfilling Functional Demands of BPM in Long-tailed Change Environments"}, {"paperId": "35701ad40b592b84a90320f7d859e89ad2f84f79", "title": "2020 International Conference on Service Science (ICSS) ICSS 2020"}]}
