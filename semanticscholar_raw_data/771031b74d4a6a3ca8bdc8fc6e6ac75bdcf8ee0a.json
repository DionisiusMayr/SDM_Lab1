The horizon of knowledge on S. aureus pathogenesis has expanded with the advancement of data-driven bioinformatics techniques. Mining information from sequenced genomes and their expression data is an economic approach that alleviates wastage of resources and redundancy in experiments. The current review covers how big data bioinformatics has been used in the analysis of S. aureus from publicly available \u2013omics data to uncover mechanisms of infection and inhibition. Particularly, advances in the past two decades in biomarker discovery, host responses, phenotype identification, consolidation of information, and drug development are discussed highlighting the challenges and shortcomings. Overall, the review summarizes the diverse aspects of scrupulous re-analysis of S. aureus proteomic and transcriptomic expression datasets retrieved from public repositories in terms of the efforts taken, benefits offered, and follow-up actions. The detailed review thus serves as a reference and aid for (i) Computational biologists by briefing the approaches utilized for bacterial omics re-analysis concerning S. aureus and (ii) Experimental biologists by elucidating the potential of bioinformatics in biological research to generate reliable postulates in a prompt and economical manner.", "venue": "Critical reviews in microbiology", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-04-25", "journal": {"name": "Critical Reviews in Microbiology", "pages": "391 - 413", "volume": "49"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2072330006", "name": "Devika Subramanian"}, {"authorId": "2355178", "name": "J.
