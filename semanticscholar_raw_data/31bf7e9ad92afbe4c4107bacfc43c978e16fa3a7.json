In addition, the implementation of 5G networks as well as WIFI 6, helps its growth and use by organizations and individuals seeking to acquire these types of devices. This leads to the growth of cyber-attackers who are only interested in exposing or compromising an organization's assets through these devices. Therefore, this article presents the basis for proposing the development of an intelligent agent that is capable of responding to any computer attack on Internet devices used by organizations and/or individuals. The development of this agent will be based on security aspects that are indicated in ISO/IEC 27001 and the COBIT 5 for Information Security and Risk framework for threat management and mitigation. In addition, this agent will allow the management and mitigation of threats, facilitating the decision making and/or creation or improvement of the controls used in the organization before any security incident.", "venue": "2020 9th International Conference On Software Process Improvement (CIMPS)", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2020-10-21", "journal": {"name": "2020 9th International Conference On Software Process Improvement (CIMPS)", "pages": "148-154"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2066896683", "name": "Einar Jhordany Serna Valdivia"}, {"authorId": "2066896982", "name": "Jezreel Mej\u00eda miranda"}], "citations": []}
