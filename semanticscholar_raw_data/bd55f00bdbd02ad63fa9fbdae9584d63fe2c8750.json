Probiotics have been shown to directly impact various immune cells, including dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, and T and B cells. By interacting with cell surface receptors, they regulate immune cell activity, produce metabolites that influence immune responses, and control the release of cytokines and chemokines.", "venue": "Immunity, Inflammation and Disease", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-10-01", "journal": {"name": "Immunity, Inflammation and Disease", "volume": "11"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2258312927", "name": "Ni Guo"}, {"authorId": "2258312163", "name": "Lu\u2010lu Lv"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "14d97bb2988e59df6183b46cf942c29a26d06367", "title": "The regulation of intestinal microbiota and the intervention of Chinese herbal medicine in the treatment of ulcerative colitis"}, {"paperId": "7f5e11616a69ab187077161bdbd34abab6877e7e", "title": "Oral Delivery of Astaxanthin via Carboxymethyl Chitosan-Modified Nanoparticles for Ulcerative Colitis Treatment"}, {"paperId": "3735c6bf8d85cadc260c4a17b792d10617b484f2", "title": "Lactiplantibacillus plantarum HY7718 Improves Intestinal Integrity in a DSS-Induced Ulcerative Colitis Mouse Model by Suppressing Inflammation through Modulation of the Gut Microbiota"}]}
