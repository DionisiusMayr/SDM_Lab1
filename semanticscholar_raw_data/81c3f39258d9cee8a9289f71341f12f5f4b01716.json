Conventional federated learning approaches are inefficient for cross-silo problems because they require the exchange of messages for gradient updates at every iteration, and raise security concerns over sharing such messages during learning. We propose a Federated Stochastic Block Coordinate Descent (FedBCD) algorithm, allowing each party to conduct multiple local updates before each communication to effectively reduce communication overhead. Under a practical security model, we show that parties cannot infer others' exact raw data (\u201cdeep leakage\u201d) from collections of messages exchanged in our framework, regardless of the number of communication to be performed. Further, we provide convergence guarantees and empirical evaluations on a variety of tasks and datasets, demonstrating significant improvement inefficiency.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Signal
