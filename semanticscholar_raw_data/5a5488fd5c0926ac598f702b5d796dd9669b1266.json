However, the involvement of specialist knowledge from various disciplines has resulted in a primarily application-specific focus (e.g., earthquakes, floods, infectious diseases) for information cascade prediction of public emergencies. The lack of a unified prediction framework poses a challenge for classifying intersectional prediction methods across different application fields. This survey paper offers a systematic classification and summary of information cascade modeling, prediction, and application. We aim to help researchers identify cutting-edge research and comprehend models and methods of information cascade prediction under public emergencies. By summarizing open issues and outlining future directions in this field, this paper has the potential to be a valuable resource for researchers conducting further studies on predicting information cascades.", "venue": "", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2024-03-28", "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2294698410", "name": "Qi Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2295288966", "name": "Guang Wang"}, {"authorId": "2227684859", "name": "Li Lin"}, {"authorId": "2227501664", "name": "Kaiwen Xia"}, {"authorId": "2294714912", "name": "Shuai Wang"}], "citations": []}
