However, network latency between geographically distributed hosts would slow down the workflow's makespan time. This paper proposes a geo-aware task allocation approach (GTAA). GTAA partitions the workflow for geo-distributed data centers(DCs) and reduces sub-workflows across DCs. GTAA aims to optimize overall workflow makespan time and improves the efficiency of workflow.", "venue": "2019 IEEE International Conference on Web Services (ICWS)", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2019-07-08", "journal": {"name": "2019 IEEE International Conference on Web Services (ICWS)", "pages": "449-451"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2057069402", "name": "Meng Niu"}, {"authorId": "145828249", "name": "B.
