Analysis of sentiments is a subtype of natural language processing that incorporates data extraction. For this purpose, numerous types of techniques and algorithms are used. In this paper used the previous twitter data for sentimental analysis and categorization. It is necessary for sentiment analysis to make use of and execute appropriate data visualization and preprocessing. For the analysis of positive or negative sentiments machine learning algorithm is used. In this work used the naive byes classifier for the analysis of the sentiments.", "venue": "2023 Second International Conference on Electronics and Renewable Systems (ICEARS)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-03-02", "journal": {"name": "2023 Second International Conference on Electronics and Renewable Systems (ICEARS)", "pages": "1425-1429"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2055615362", "name": "Vivek J.
