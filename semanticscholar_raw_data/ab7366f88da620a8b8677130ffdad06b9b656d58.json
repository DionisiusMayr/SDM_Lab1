Regression test selection (RTS) aims to reduce the required testing effort and feedback time for developers. However, existing RTS techniques are imprecise for tests with cross-language links to compiled C++ binaries or unsafe if tests use external files. This is problematic because modern software in fact involves several programming languages and (non-)code artifacts such as configuration files. In this paper, we present BinaryRTS, a novel RTS technique that leverages dynamic binary instrumentation to collect the covered functions and accessed external files for each test. BinaryRTS then selects tests depending on changes issued to C++ binaries or external (non-)code artifacts. When evaluating BinaryRTS in our large-scale industrial context, we are able to exclude on average up to 74% of tests without missing real failures. We release BinaryRTS as the first publicly available RTS tool for software involving C++ code.", "venue": "International Conference on Information Control Systems & Technologies", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-04-01", "journal": {"name": "2023 IEEE Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation (ICST)", "pages": "327-338"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2064171309", "name": "Daniel Elsner"}, {"authorId": "1891742", "name": "Severin Kacianka"}, {"authorId": "2170283628", "name": "Stephan Lipp"}, {"authorId": "144658639", "name": "A.
