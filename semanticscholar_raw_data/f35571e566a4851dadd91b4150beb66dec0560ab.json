However, with the increasingly larger data-sets, such as weather data and marketing transactions, the data organization/access becomes more challenging in selective bulk data processing with the use of current big data processing frameworks such as Spark or keyvalue stores. In this paper, we propose a method to optimize selective bulk analysis in big data processing and referred to as Oseba. Oseba maintains a super index for the data organization in memory to support fast lookup through targeting the data involved with each selective analysis program. Oseba is able to save memory as well as computation in comparison to the default data processing frameworks.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2017-07-12", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/1707.03527"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2151038169", "name": "Rui Wang"}, {"authorId": "2152810162", "name": "Jun Wang"}], "citations": []}
