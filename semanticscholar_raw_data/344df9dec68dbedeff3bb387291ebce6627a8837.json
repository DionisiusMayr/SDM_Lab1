Our purpose in organizing the first ACAIA (Approximate Computing for Affordable and Interactive Analytics) was to bridge this gap. By bringing together academic and industrial participants, roughly in a 50-50 ratio, we intended to facilitate a high-bandwidth conversation in both directions with the aim to understand practical use cases better, discuss adoption concerns for approximate analytics especially when users have different statistical capabilities and to determine the practical usefulness of recent research efforts in approximate computing. We believe that the workshop has served these goals. We expand on this aspect in the rest of this document. The attendees included several large data platforms including some start-ups focused on this topic. We invited keynotes from leading researchers in the space. The agenda included demonstrations of recent advances and descriptions of use-cases from several industrial participants.", "venue": "", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "40155297", "name": "Yongjoo Park"}, {"authorId": "1741860", "name": "Srikanth Kandula"}, {"authorId": "2066753137", "name": "S.
