Existing scheduling strategies can hardly guarantee latency under performance constraints, let alone accounting for the communication cost incurred by scheduling itself. To address these issues, we propose Lg-Stream, a latency guaranteed scheduling strategy under performance constraints. This paper discusses the Lg-Stream strategy from the following aspects: (1) We model the topology as a queuing network to evaluate the system latency; (2) For scenarios with limited resources and latency constraints, we ensure that each executor-to-component allocation optimizes the system's processing latency to the maximum, consequently altering the components\u2019 parallelism; (3) We place executors that communicate with each other on the same node as much as possible. Experimental results demonstrated that in comparison to existing state-of-the-art scheduling strategies, it reduces the average system latency up to 30%.", "venue": "International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-12-17", "journal": {"name": "2023 IEEE 29th International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems (ICPADS)", "pages": "2730-2733"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2286490425", "name": "Dawei Sun"}, {"authorId": "2293635886", "name": "Chengjun Guan"}, {"authorId": "2293772372", "name": "Yinuo Fan"}, {"authorId": "2293635003", "name": "Jia Rung"}, {"authorId": "2112310850", "name": "Shang Gao"}], "citations": []}
