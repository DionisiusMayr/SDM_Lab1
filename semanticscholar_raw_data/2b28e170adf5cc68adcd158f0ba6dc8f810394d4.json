Traditionally, SVA formulation involves expert-driven interpretation of specifications, which is timeconsuming and prone to human error. However, LLM-informed automatic assertion generation is gaining interest. We designeda novel framework called ChIRAAG, based on OpenAI GPT4, to generate SVA assertions from natural language specifications. ChIRAAG constitutes the systematic breakdown of design specifications into a standardized format, further generating assertions from formatted specifications using LLM. Furthermore, we developed testbenches to verify/validate the LLM-generated assertions. Automatic feedback of log files from the simulation tool to the LLM ensures that the framework can generate correc SVAs automatically. Only 33% of LLM-generated raw assertions had errors. Our results on OpenTitan designs shows that LLMs can streamline and assist engineers in the assertion generation process, reshaping verification workflows.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-01-31", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2402.00093"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2282139041", "name": "Bhabesh Mali"}, {"authorId": "2282139037", "name": "Karthik Maddala"}, {"authorId": "2282498820", "name": "Sweeya Reddy"}, {"authorId": "2282220875", "name": "Vatsal Gupta"}, {"authorId": "2350012", "name": "C.
