Along with: (a) SQL$_\\delta$, an SQL dialect augmented with graph pattern queries and tuple-vertex joins, such that one can extract graph properties via graph pattern matching, and\"semantically\"match entities across relations and graphs; (b) a logical representation of graphs in RDBMS, which introduces an exploration operator for efficient pattern querying, supports also browsing and updating graph-structured data; and (c) a strategy to uniformly evaluate SQL, pattern and hybrid queries that join tuples and vertices, all inside an RDBMS by leveraging its optimizer without performance degradation on switching different execution engines. A lightweight system, WhiteDB, is developed as an implementation to evaluate the benefits it can actually bring on real-life data. We empirically verified that the RG model enables the graph pattern queries to be answered as efficiently as in native graph engines; can consider the access on graph and relation in any order for optimal plan; and supports effective data enrichment.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-01-31", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2401.18019"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2282108783", "name": "Wenzhi Fu"}], "citations": []}
