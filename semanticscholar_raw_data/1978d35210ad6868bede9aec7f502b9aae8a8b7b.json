The health data are growing increasingly large, more complex, and its sources have increased tremendously to include computerized physician order entry, electronic medical records, clinical notes, medical images, cyber-physical systems, medical Internet of Things, genomic data, and clinical decision support systems. New types of data from sources like social network services and genomic data are used to build personalized healthcare systems, hence health data are obtained in various forms, from varied sources, contexts, technologies, and their nature can impede a proper analysis. Any analytical research must overcome these obstacles to mine data and produce meaningful insights to save lives. In this paper, we investigate the key challenges, data sources, techniques, technologies, as well as future directions in the field of big data analytics in healthcare. We provide a do-it-yourself review that delivers a holistic, simplified, and easily understandable view of various technologies that are used to develop an integrated health analytic application.", "venue": "IEEE Access", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2018-10-26", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Access", "pages": "65661-65678", "volume": "6"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "51990429", "name": "Gaspard Harerimana"}, {"authorId": "3235960", "name": "Beakcheol Jang"}, {"authorId": "2145246865", "name": "Jong Wook Kim"}, {"authorId": "2523615", "name": "H.
