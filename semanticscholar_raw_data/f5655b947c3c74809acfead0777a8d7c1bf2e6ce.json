The concept of Linked Data Space needs to be considered in conjunction with organizations and their provenance with respect to their origin assuming that the shared data is semantic and considering organizations' access to relevant semantic data. In this context, this study elaborates on the concept of Linked Data Space, introducing the terms Internal Data and External Data to the literature. An architecture for Linked Data Space and data management for organizations is defined in addition to these concepts. Furthermore, the study explains how organizations can access External Data in the Linked Data Space and how provenance metadata and ontologies will be created. These developed methods are illustrated in the News Aggregator Scenario, a main scenario for provenance, demonstrating how it can work in a use case.", "venue": "European Journal of Technic", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-12-26", "journal": {"name": "European Journal of Technic"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1394553168", "name": "Fatih Soygazi"}, {"authorId": "3353413", "name": "Tugkan Tuglular"}, {"authorId": "2400532", "name": "Oguz Dikenelli"}], "citations": []}
