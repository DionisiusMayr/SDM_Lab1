High\u2010throughput techniques enable the rapid generation of high\u2010dimensional multiomics data. This multiomics approach provides a more complete perspective to study biological systems compared with traditional methods. However, the quantitative analysis and integration of distinct types of high\u2010dimensional omics data remain a challenge. Here, we provide an up\u2010to\u2010date and comprehensive review of the methods used for omics data quantification and integration. We first review the quantitative analysis of not only bulk but also single\u2010cell transcriptomics data, as well as proteomics data. Current methods for reducing batch effects and integrating heterogeneous high\u2010dimensional data are then introduced. Network analysis on large\u2010scale biomedical data can capture the global properties of drugs, targets, and disease relationships, thus enabling a better understanding of biological systems. Current trends in the applications and methods used to extend quantitative omics data analysis to biological networks are also discussed.", "venue": "WIREs Computational Molecular Science", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-02-01", "journal": {"name": "Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Computational Molecular Science", "volume": "13"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "143857848", "name": "Hsueh\u2010Fen Juan"}, {"authorId": "2115636477", "name": "Hsuan-Cheng Huang"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "7ef7538f559813c62787fb46519602e625890ce0", "title": "Postmortem Minimally Invasive Autopsy in Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients at the Bedside: A Proof-of-Concept Study at the ICU"}, {"paperId": "6b235ab8759c4a6245a3d71174bc31f256050608", "title": "Combination of multiple omics techniques for a personalized therapy or treatment selection"}]}
