New and more complex architectures have been introduced in HPC systems to afford these new restrictions, and include coprocessors such as GPGPUs for intensive computational tasks. As systems increase in heterogeneity, workload distribution becomes a more core problem to achieve the maximum efficiency in every computational component. We present a Multi-Objective Dynamic Load Balancing (DLB) approach where several objectives can be applied to tune an application. These objectives can be dynamically exchanged during the execution of an algorithm to better adapt to the resources available in a system. We have implemented the Multi\u2013Objective DLB together with a generic heuristic engine, designed to perform multiple strategies for DLB in iterative problems. We also present Ull Multiobjective Framework (UllMF), an open\u2013source tool that implements the Multi-Objective generic approach. UllMF separates metric gathering, objective functions to be optimized and load balancing algorithms, and improves code portability using a simple interface to reduce the costs of new implementations. We illustrate how performance and energy consumption are improved for the implemented techniques, and analyze their quality using different DLB techniques from the literature.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-10-01", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems", "pages": "2421-2434", "volume": "31"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2064409581", "name": "A.
