The intensity and frequency of this extreme weather event are expected to increase due to significant changes in the present\u2010day climate and land use and land cover (LULC) pattern. India has a very systematic and organized structural program and policies but lacks proper implementations, and adverse effect of climate change and the extreme event goes on in society. This paper is an analysis of floods in India and hazards due to climate change and LULC change patterns. Three models, namely \u201cEco\u2010biogeography\u2010based optimization (EBO), Random forest (RF), and Support vector machine (SVM)\u201d were used to obtain the final output to prepare a \u201cFlood susceptibility map\u201d. The result was validated through the \u201cReceiver operating characteristics (ROC)\u201d with \u201cArea under curve (AUC)\u201d values. The future rainfall scenario has been estimated by considering the \u201cGeneral circulation models\u201d through different \u201cshared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs)\u201d. The values of AUC are 0.915 (EBO), 0.887 (RF), and 0.869 (SVM), respectively. After consideration of different SSPs, the result shows that there is an increasing tendency of flood hazards in the projected period. Among all the employed modelling approaches, the EBO model has notable potential in delineating the possible flood\u2010prone regions for effective flood planning and management. Decision\u2010makers can benefit from country\u2010specific information and regional planner to implement sustainable and long\u2010term measures to overcome this type of hazardous situation.", "venue": "Geological Journal", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2023-03-16", "journal": {"name": "Geological Journal", "pages": "3515 - 3543", "volume": "58"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "117960838", "name": "Indrajit Chowdhuri"}, {"authorId": "48027109", "name": "S.
