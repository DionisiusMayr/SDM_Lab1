There are various cheating approaches while traditional anti-fraud methods are only effective for specific patterns. Combining the rule-based methods with supervised classification methods, we propose an abnormal traffic detection framework on both user layer and traffic layer. On the user layer, rule-based filters are designed to detect malicious users with duplicate clicks. We extract hybrid features under multi-granular time windows and train a user classifier to filter cheaters and complex spams indirectly. On traffic layer, we apply traffic filters to detect explicit fraudulent clicks and use a prediction model to detect malicious traffic with a higher precision. Extensive experiments on ground-truth data demonstrate the effectiveness of our detection method.", "venue": "International Conference on Big Knowledge", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Engineering"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2017-08-01", "journal": {"name": "2017 IEEE International Conference on Big Knowledge (ICBK)", "pages": "236-241"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2119043921", "name": "Kun Wang"}, {"authorId": "2115723816", "name": "Guohai Xu"}, {"authorId": "50097294", "name": "Chengyu Wang"}, {"authorId": "143644849", "name": "Xiaofeng He"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "c4326e63193577b87ecbc12dbc70fde842c24b19", "title": "Fraudulent traffic detection in online advertising with bipartite graph propagation algorithm"}]}
