We propose a new classification scheme premised on the reality of imperfect data. Our computational model uses uncertain data envelopment analysis to define a classification's proximity to equitable efficiency, which is an aggregate measure of intra-similarity within a classification's categories. Our classification process has two overriding computational challenges, those being a loss of convexity and a combinatorially explosive search space. We overcome the first by establishing lower and upper bounds on the proximity value, and then by searching this range with a first-order algorithm. We overcome the second by adapting the p-median problem to initiate our exploration, and by then employing an iterative neighborhood search to finalize a classification. We conclude by classifying the thirty stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial average into performant tiers and by classifying prostate treatments into clinically effectual categories.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-09-02", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2209.01052"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2184032233", "name": "Casey Garner"}, {"authorId": "39872394", "name": "A.
