Our daily lives in today\u2018s world are The rapidly fields of science advancing engineering and technology never are producing quenching data at an exponential rate leading to Exabyte(s) of data every day. Big data helps us to explore and re-invent many areas not limited to education, health and law. The primary purpose of this paper is to provide an in-depth analysis in the area of Healthcare using the big data and analytics. The main purpose is to emphasize on the usage of the big data which is being stored all the time helping to look back in the history, but this is the time to emphasize on the Analyzation to improve the medication and services. Although, many big data implementations happen to be in-house development, this proposed. Implementation aims to propose a broader extent using Hadoop, which just happen to be the tip of the iceberg. The focus of this paper is not limited to the improvement and analysis of the data; it also focuses on the strengths and drawbacks compared to the conventional techniques available.", "venue": "", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2113791627", "name": "Sateesh kumar Sankarapu"}, {"authorId": "143873926", "name": "T.
