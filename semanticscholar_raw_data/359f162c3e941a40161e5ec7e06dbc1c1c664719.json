We find that while blocking engagement on certain tweets limited their diffusion, messages we examined with warning labels spread further on Twitter than those without labels. Additionally, the messages that had been blocked on Twitter remained popular on Facebook, Instagram, and Reddit, being posted more often and garnering more visibility than messages that had either been labeled by Twitter or received no intervention at all. Taken together, our results emphasize the importance of considering content moderation at the ecosystem level.", "venue": "Harvard Kennedy School Misinformation Review", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Political Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2021-08-24", "journal": {"name": "Harvard Kennedy School Misinformation Review"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1393027621", "name": "Zeve Sanderson"}, {"authorId": "2108812447", "name": "Megan A.
