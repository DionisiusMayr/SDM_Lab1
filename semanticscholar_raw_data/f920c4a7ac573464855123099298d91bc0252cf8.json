Join appears frequently in Spark programs, such as PageRank algorithm. Due to join operation will bring lots of Shuffle, thus it costs much time in big data processing. In this paper, we optimize each iteration and total application of PageRank algorithm using broadcast, cache and broadcast-cache in three ways respectively. Experiment data show that broadcast, cache can reduce Shuffle effectively, and thus greatly decrease running time of job. The effect is significant.", "venue": "International Conference on Innovative Computing and Cloud Computing", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2017-12-01", "journal": {"name": "2017 3rd IEEE International Conference on Computer and Communications (ICCC)", "pages": "2295-2298"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "40801599", "name": "Deyang Qiu"}, {"authorId": "91936516", "name": "Wenli Zhou"}, {"authorId": "9756930", "name": "Jun Liu"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "fb84d5ddc43200d351ff299834b9016994d4de78", "title": "Optimization of Population Mobility Model of Artificial Society Based on Big Data Analytics"}, {"paperId": "d9084c1ed5a0ee99067d0c65da97b9268bf0341a", "title": "Spark Performance Optimization Analysis With Multi-Layer Parameter Using Shuffling and Scheduling With Data Serialization in Different Data Caching Options"}]}
