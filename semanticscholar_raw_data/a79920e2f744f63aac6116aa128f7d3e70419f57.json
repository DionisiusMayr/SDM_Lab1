Young adults' food intake was greatly impacted by their social isolation, particularly female university students, who began to employ mobile-based food delivery apps (FDAs) and online meal delivery services. This study's goal was to pinpoint the variables that affect consumers' decision to use FDAs during the COVID-19 epidemic. Data were gathered from seven female users in Dhaka, and numerous categories of the elements discovered in the study were thematically evaluated. The findings demonstrated a relationship between behavior and continued desire to use mobile-based FDAs and subjective norms, attitudes, and consumer perceptions of price, delivery time, e-service quality, past experiences, food quality, payment methods, and trust. The study's findings also guarantee that consumers will use FDAs with satisfaction and loyalty. While conducting, the study encountered minor restrictions. Future research should focus on the contributions that FDAs make in various contexts, use comparisons and descriptions, and customer usage intentions throughout time to promote FDAs in the global economy.", "venue": "Asian Review of Social Sciences", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-10-28", "journal": {"name": "Asian Review of Social Sciences"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2128622530", "name": "Nusrat Parvin"}], "citations": []}
