As it is composed of many machines, its file system, called HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System), is also distributed. But as HDFS is not a traditional storage system, plenty of new file formats have been developed, to take advantage of its features. In this work we study that new formats to find out their characteristics, and being able to decide which ones can be better knowing the needs of our data. For that goal, we have made a theoretical framework to compare them, and easily recognize which formats fit our needs. Also we have made an experimental study to find out how the formats work in some specific situations, selecting two very different datasets and a set of simple queries, resolved with MapReduce jobs, written with Java or run using Hive tool. The final goal of this work is to be able to identify the different strengths and weakenesses of the file formats.", "venue": "", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "", "volume": ""}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2071288999", "name": "\u00c1lvaro Alonso Isla"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "7d2bada89453fea9e5e4a37dc21a9bd50951cbc3", "title": "A Benchmark for Suitability of Alluxio over Spark"}, {"paperId": "77967fcf7b93ad999c61fb771c23ba82e4590421", "title": "Explorando paralelismo em big data no processamento de s\u00e9ries temporais de imagens de sensoriamento remoto"}, {"paperId": "20b1cebbd515c20ff7a16db5609e42b5b2260374", "title": "Embedding Indices and Bloom Filters in Parquet files for Fast Apache Arrow Retrievals"}, {"paperId": "84cd7df443b31c60a839ade61cec9f2607ae7281", "title": "SmarT: Uso de Aprendizado de M\u00e1quina para Filtragem e Recupera\u00e7\u00e3o Eficiente de Dados Espaciais e Temporais em Big Data"}]}
