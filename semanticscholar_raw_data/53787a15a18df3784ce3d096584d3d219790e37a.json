Existing approaches primarily focus on predicting UEs using correctable errors (CEs), without fully considering the information provided by error bits. However, error bit patterns have a strong correlation with the occurrence of uncorrectable errors (UEs). In this paper, we present a comprehensive study on the correlation between CEs and UEs, specifically emphasizing the importance of spatio-temporal error bit information. Our analysis reveals a strong correlation between spatio-temporal error bits and UE occurrence. Through evaluations using real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves prediction performance by 15% in F1-score compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms. Overall, our approach effectively reduces the number of virtual machine interruptions caused by UEs by approximately 59%.", "venue": "2023 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer Aided Design (ICCAD)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-10-28", "journal": {"name": "2023 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer Aided Design (ICCAD)", "pages": "01-09"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2153795356", "name": "Qiao Yu"}, {"authorId": "2230032714", "name": "Wengui Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2268901198", "name": "Jorge Cardoso"}, {"authorId": "144754478", "name": "O.
