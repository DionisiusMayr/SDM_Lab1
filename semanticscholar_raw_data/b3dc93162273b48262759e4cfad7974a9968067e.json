Through combining the single-carrier frequency-division-multiplexed with the proposed architecture, this structure can achieve unprecedented flexibility in dealing with both mice and elephant flow in the DCN. Multiple-input multiple-output switching is experimentally demonstrated through intra- and inter-data centre switching scenarios. A numerical investigation is also performed to evaluate the performance of the fixed-grid transceivers, flex-grid transceivers and mixed-fixed/flex grid transceivers in the same switching scenario. The results show that the flex-grid transceivers significantly reduced the service latency and blocking probability compared to the fixed-grid transceivers. The proposed architecture would be better applied in the field of all-optical DCNs.", "venue": "IET Communications", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2018-09-20", "journal": {"name": "IET Commun.", "pages": "2623-2629", "volume": "12"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1830528", "name": "Qian Kong"}, {"authorId": "38924858", "name": "Y.
