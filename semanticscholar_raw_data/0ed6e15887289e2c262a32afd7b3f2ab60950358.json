Reducing the energy cost and improving its efficiency can be done at the DC level and at the server level where task scheduling takes place. Task scheduling not only focuses on improving the energy efficiency but also to allocate the resources efficiently in a timely manner by optimizing energy consumption. With the rise of new technologies in this era, one of the technologies is Blockchain. Blockchain technology has been used with the cloud in terms of security and storage. This paper proposes a heuristic approach to task scheduling in the cloud using blockchain. The work is carried out to improve the parameters such as wait time, execution time, and Service Level Agreement (SLA) that will eventually help to reduce the energy consumption and its cost. The aim of this research is to identify the benefits of blockchain in the cloud to schedule the tasks and explore its feasibility.", "venue": "", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2018-09-14", "journal": {"name": "", "volume": ""}, "authors": [{"authorId": "74843935", "name": "F.
