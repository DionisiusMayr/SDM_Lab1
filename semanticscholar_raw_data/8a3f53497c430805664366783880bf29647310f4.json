Our method is based on tools from topological data analysis: we define a new filtration on metric spaces which is a variant of the Vietoris\u2013Rips filtration that adds information about the points' nearest neighbor to the persistence diagram. We prove a stability theorem for this filtration, and evaluate our method on point cloud and graph datasets, showing that it can compete with state-of-the-art methods while being non-parametric.", "venue": "Frontiers in Applied Mathematics and Statistics", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-04-04", "journal": {"name": "Frontiers in Applied Mathematics and Statistics"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2165205423", "name": "Alexandre Bois"}, {"authorId": "103342901", "name": "Brian Tervil"}, {"authorId": "2295213226", "name": "Laurent Oudre"}], "citations": []}
