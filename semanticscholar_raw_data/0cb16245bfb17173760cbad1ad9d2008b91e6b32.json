IoTPy helps build streaming applications in four ways: (1) enables the construction of non-terminating applications that continuously process endless streams of data by encapsulating terminating programs; (2) supports computation throughout a network of nodes from sensors at the edges of the network to the cloud and back to actuators at the edge; (3) allows users to separate concerns of the logic of an application from the parallel hardware on which the application runs, and (4) supports proofs and testing of the correct behavior of a composition from the specifications of its components.", "venue": "International Conference of Distributed Computing and Networking", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2019-01-04", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Distributed Computing and Networking"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1732486", "name": "K.
