DataMingler is a prototype tool that implements a novel conceptual model, the Data Virtual Machine (DVM) and can be used for agile just-in-time modeling of data from diverse sources. The DVM provides easy-to-understand semantics and fast and \ufb02exible schema manipulations. An important and useful class of queries in analytics environments, dataframes , is de\ufb01ned in the context of DVMs. These queries can be expressed either visually or through a novel query language, DVM-QL. We demonstrate DataMingler\u2019s capabilities map relational sources and queries on the latter in a DVM schema and augment it with information from semi-structured and unstructured sources. We also show how to express on the DVM easily complex relational queries or queries on structured, semi-structured and unstructured sources combined.", "venue": "ER Demos/Posters", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"pages": "43-48"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1730475", "name": "Damianos Chatziantoniou"}, {"authorId": "1713548", "name": "Verena Kantere"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "adc1fb147394d8df689f748bb06142ad6907f091", "title": "Conceptual Modeling: Topics, Themes, and Technology Trends"}, {"paperId": "c88eccbf43fc27f24d16678446fa62fffde37660", "title": "Data Virtual Machines: Simplifying Data Sharing, Exploration & Querying in Big Data Environments"}]}
