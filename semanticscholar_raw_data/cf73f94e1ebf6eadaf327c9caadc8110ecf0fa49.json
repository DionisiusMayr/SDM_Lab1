The problem is particularly relevant for multi-stage and possibly distributed production processes in which an overview of the individual process steps must be created. Modelling of data with semantic technologies provides a solution basis for this, but has not yet been established in industry due to a lack of knowledge about the technologies and advantages of semantic modelling. This paper describes a possible concept for information modelling of production process data with ontologies of different granularity levels. Subsequently, a concept for communication between developed ontologies is presented, with which data of different levels of manufacturing can be networked.", "venue": "2022 IEEE International Conference on Technology Management, Operations and Decisions (ICTMOD)", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-11-23", "journal": {"name": "2022 IEEE International Conference on Technology Management, Operations and Decisions (ICTMOD)", "pages": "1-6"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2120175832", "name": "Aleksandra M\u00fcller"}, {"authorId": "2206766593", "name": "Vincent H\u00fctsch"}, {"authorId": "46186819", "name": "S.
