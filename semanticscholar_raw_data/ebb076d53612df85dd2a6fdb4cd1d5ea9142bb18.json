Besides, the process of E-payment has endless hidden dangers, posing a great threat to payment security. In this context, risk assessment and prediction of E-payment are particularly important. Therefore, this paper mainly studies the E-payment analysis and prediction method based on big data technology. Specifically, this paper uses the BP neural network to extract E-payment data feature and compare and analyze the characteristic of different methods; finally, the payment risks are predicted based on the features, the simulation experiments show that the best result is obtained by the method proposed in this paper, and thus the effectiveness of the new method is verified.", "venue": "Mathematical Problems in Engineering", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-06-02", "journal": {"name": "Mathematical Problems in Engineering"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "39853709", "name": "Fei Liu"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "0ea0c35187e6a074e5b615ad80747499e7257735", "title": "A Fiscal Policy Foresight Tax Model, Shadow Economy Reduction, and E-Payment Institutionalization as a Result of Knowledge Management"}]}
