The most notable feature is the diversity of the workloads it handles, including batch processing, real-time data analytics, and unstructured data analytics. To improve the overall performance for such diverse workloads, one of the major challenges is to optimize long-running complex queries without sacrificing the processing efficiency of short-running interactive queries. While existing methods attempt to utilize runtime dynamic statistics for adaptive query processing, they often focus on specific scenarios instead of providing a holistic solution.\n \n \n To address this challenge, we propose a new framework called\n Anser\n , which enhances the design of traditional distributed data warehouses by embedding a new information sharing mechanism. This allows for the efficient management of the production and consumption of various dynamic information across the system. Building on top of\n Anser\n , we introduce a novel scheduling policy that optimizes both data and information exchanges within the physical plan, enabling the acceleration of complex analytical queries without sacrificing the performance of short-running interactive queries. We conduct comprehensive experiments over public and in-house workloads to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed information sharing framework.\n", "venue": "Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-08-01", "journal": {"name": "Proc.
