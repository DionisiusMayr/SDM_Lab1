Advancements as compared to state-of-art works include: (1) \u201cvolumetric\u201d temperature monitoring instead traditional \u201cpointwise\u201d temperature information; (2) accurate temperature readings spanning an operational distance of 5 m as validated by a commercial thermometer for 3 days; and (3) capable of detecting global average temperature and local temperature events by installing networked/grid PMUT pairs. This innovative sensing technique could be applicable for the precision control of future building/living environments.", "venue": "IEEE/LEOS International Conference on Optical MEMS", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2024-01-21", "journal": {"name": "2024 IEEE 37th International Conference on Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS)", "pages": "967-970"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2273620914", "name": "Megan Teng"}, {"authorId": "2063760936", "name": "Wei Yue"}, {"authorId": "2210239339", "name": "P.
