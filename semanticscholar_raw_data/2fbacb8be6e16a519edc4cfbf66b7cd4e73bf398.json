Still, one important question remains: Can WSB\u2019s community of anonymous contributors actually provide valuable investment advice and possibly even outperform top \ufb01nancial institutions? We present a data-driven empirical study of investment recommendations of WSB in comparison to recommendations made by leading investment banks, based on more than 1.6 million WSB posts published since 2018. To this end, we extract and evaluate investment recommendations from WSB\u2019s raw text for all S&P 500 stocks and compare their performance to more than 16,000 analyst recommendations from the largest investment banks. While not all WSB recommendations prove pro\ufb01table, our results show that they achieve average returns that compete with the best banks and outperform them in certain cases. Furthermore, the WSB community has been better than almost all investment banks at detecting top-performing stocks. We conclude that WSB may indeed constitute a freely accessible, valuable source of investment advice.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Economics"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-12-31", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2301.00170"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3361431", "name": "Tolga Buz"}, {"authorId": "144608002", "name": "Gerard de Melo"}], "citations": []}
