In recent years, big data has exploded in the communications industry, especially in the 4G industry card data. However, the large amount of data and processing dimensions of 4G industry card data incur a large overhead of query performance. In order to improve its query ef\ufb01ciency, this paper studies the impact of data organization on query performance, and proposes a data organization framework suitable for 4G industry card data. The proposed framework integrates data organization patterns of Spark SQL and HBase + Phoenix, and can automatically select the appropriate data organization for different business types. The experimental results show that the proposed data organization framework improves the query ef\ufb01ciency by 35.35% on average.", "venue": "", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2221271553", "name": "Jianbo Li"}, {"authorId": "2119194980", "name": "Jianghua Luo"}, {"authorId": "2114791995", "name": "Zhiwen Song"}, {"authorId": "2114939500", "name": "Zhao Luo"}], "citations": []}
