Therefore, with the development of information technology and increasing dynamism in the business environment, it is expected that these computers will be more intensively deployed. In this paper, research was conducted in Danube region countries: Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Moldova, Montenegro, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Ukraine. The aim of the research was to determine what criteria are most significant for the introduction of high-performance computing and the real situation in each of the countries. In addition, the aim was to establish the infrastructure needed to implement such a system. In order to determine the partial significance of each criterion and thus the possibility of implementing high-performance computing, a multi-criteria model in a fuzzy environment was applied. The weights of criteria and their rankings were performed using the Fuzzy PIvot Pairwise RElative Criteria Importance Assessment\u2014fuzzy PIPRECIA method. The results indicate different values depend on decision-makers (DMs) in the countries. Spearman\u2019s and Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients were calculated to verify the results obtained.", "venue": "Sustainability", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2020-04-09", "journal": {"name": "Sustainability"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "113697719", "name": "M.
