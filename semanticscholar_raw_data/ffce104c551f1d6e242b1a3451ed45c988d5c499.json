There are several challenges in M-ITS including data integration, Interoperability, scalability, user experience, etc. To address these challenges, such a system requires an adaptive system architecture that enables M-ITS to operate as an integrated ecosystem. In this paper, we provide an adaptive, user-centric, and layered architecture for multimodal transportation systems. The proposed architecture ensures scalability for seamless interactions of various subcomponents, that are often managed by different stakeholders. Concurrently, the data architecture is detailed, covering diverse data sources, advanced analytics, and stringent governance, providing a robust basis for intelligent decision-making. We provide two example use cases of the proposed architecture, showing how the data architecture and the system architecture can be fused and serve multimodal intelligent transport services.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Engineering"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-02-13", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2402.08817"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2281947107", "name": "Muhammad Farooq"}, {"authorId": "30762366", "name": "Nima Afraz"}, {"authorId": "2267724103", "name": "Fatemeh Golpayegani"}], "citations": []}
