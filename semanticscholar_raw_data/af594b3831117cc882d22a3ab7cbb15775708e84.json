This problem has not been addressed in the past and it becomes challenging for students to connect with the right faculty of their domain. Since we have so many colleges and faculties this lies in the category of big data problem. In this paper, we present a model which works on the distributed computing environment to tackle big data. The proposed model uses apache spark as an execution engine and hive as database. The results are visualized with the help of Tableau that is connected to Apache Hive to achieve distributed computing.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2017-06-25", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/1706.08018"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "50169589", "name": "Noopur Gupta"}, {"authorId": "3399971", "name": "R.
