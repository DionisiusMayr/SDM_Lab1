Specific types of Socratic questions are employed for enabling reasoning and alternate views against the context of individual personal opinions on a topic. Socratic contexts are different from traditional question generation contexts where \u201canswer-seeking\u201d questions are generated against a given formal passage on a topic, narrative stories or conversations.We present SocratiQ, the first large dataset of 110K (question, context) pairs for enabling studies on Socratic Question Generation (SoQG). We provide an in-depth study on the various types of Socratic questions and present models for generating Socratic questions against a given context through prompt tuning. Our automated and human evaluation results demonstrate that our SoQG models can produce realistic, type-sensitive, human-like Socratic questions enabling potential applications in counseling and coaching.", "venue": "Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"pages": "147-165"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2215618416", "name": "Beng Heng Ang"}, {"authorId": "3091719", "name": "Sujatha Das Gollapalli"}, {"authorId": "1794527", "name": "See-Kiong Ng"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "1b715867e5933971e5157d1c927a0e59ee9d6bc1", "title": "Socratic Reasoning Improves Positive Text Rewriting"}, {"paperId": "5ee871537ae51e7e2e93d2a70fff5d100649a655", "title": "Mathematical Language Models: A Survey"}, {"paperId": "5f200e0d0e1c369c8f18c8846047b6acdae16f57", "title": "Transformer based Answer-Aware Bengali Question Generation"}, {"paperId": "6c5c532ed437631a59db8be4d1206ca16b7845e7", "title": "Teach Me How to Improve My Argumentation Skills: A Survey on Feedback in Argumentation"}, {"paperId": "ba81651472c6270b611ff62f030bde02ea9e1fc1", "title": "Teach Me How to Argue: A Survey on NLP Feedback Systems in Argumentation"}]}
