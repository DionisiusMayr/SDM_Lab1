The Getis-Ord statistic was utilized to create spatial models and generate map outputs for 2019 and 2020. Two distinct approaches were employed: using a census tract shapefile (provided) and creating fishnet polygons measuring 500 m by 500 m. Results showed fewer hotspots outside Edmonton's central core, while fatal collisions were concentrated close to the core. This intriguing finding suggests that COVID-19 restrictions led to more aggressive driving behaviour near the centre, contributing to a rise in fatal collision numbers. The study found a significant reduction in traffic collisions in April 2020, with a 58% decrease compared to the previous year. The research highlights the pandemic's impact on road safety, emphasizing the importance of reducing traffic volume and advocating for traffic restrictions and control strategies, multi-modal planning, and efficient pricing strategies within Vision Zero for improved road safety.", "venue": "Canadian journal of civil engineering (Print)", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-02-05", "journal": {"name": "Canadian Journal of Civil Engineering"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2273212533", "name": "Faeze Momeni Rad"}, {"authorId": "2273212818", "name": "Karim El-Basyouny"}], "citations": []}
