This scheme consists of multiple intelligent tiers: Internet of Things tier, fog service tier, and global cloud service tier supporting edge analytics for ITS services in a connected car environment. Each tier on the fog senses different contexts like location, time, available resources, and estimated response time for efficiently processing tasks to provide delay-sensitive services while optimizing virtualized resources. A preliminary prototype and a testbed for this study were built to validate the robustness of the proposed approach.", "venue": "IT Professional", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2018-11-01", "journal": {"name": "IT Professional", "pages": "35-45", "volume": "20"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1679045", "name": "Q.
