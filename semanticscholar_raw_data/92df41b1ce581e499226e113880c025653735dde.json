The goal is to \ufb01nd a proper coloring that uses few colors. (Note that the maximum degree, \u2206, is a trivial lower bound.) In this paper, we revisit this fundamental problem in two models of computation speci\ufb01c to massive graphs, the Massively Parallel Computations ( MPC ) model and the Graph Streaming model: Massively Parallel Computation. We give a randomized MPC algorithm that with high probability returns a \u2206 + e O (\u2206 3 / 4 ) edge coloring in O (1) rounds using O ( n ) space per machine and O ( m ) total space. The space per machine can also be further improved to n 1 \u2212 \u2126(1) if \u2206 = n \u2126(1) . Our algorithm improves upon a previous result of Harvey et al. [SPAA 2018]. Graph Streaming. Since the output of edge-coloring is as large as its input, we consider a standard variant of the streaming model where the output is also reported in a streaming fashion. The main challenge is that the algorithm cannot \u201cremember\u201d all the reported edge colors, yet has to output a proper edge coloring using few colors. We give a one-pass e O ( n )-space streaming algorithm that always returns a valid coloring and uses 5 . 44\u2206 colors with high probability if the edges arrive in a random order. For adversarial order streams, we give another one-pass e O ( n )-space algorithm that requires O (\u2206 2 ) colors.", "venue": "Embedded Systems and Applications", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"pages": "15:1-15:14"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "8176576", "name": "Soheil Behnezhad"}, {"authorId": "37108088", "name": "Mahsa Derakhshan"}, {"authorId": "1704161", "name": "M.
