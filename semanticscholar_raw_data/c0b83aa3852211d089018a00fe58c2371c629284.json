This new capability places additional responsibility on the query planner, which now must recommend the most cost-efficient cluster configuration for a given query. While the space of potential cluster configurations is immense, recent work has mostly focused on homogeneous clusters that consist of only one instance type. We argue that to truly leverage the flexibility of public clouds, we need to consider heterogeneous clusters consisting of multiple instance types. In this paper, we present a framework to gauge the optimality of cluster configurations, an intuitive model showcasing how heterogeneity leads to performance improvements for pipelined joins, and preliminary experimental evidence supporting the model.", "venue": "Conference on Innovative Data Systems Research", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2277575959", "name": "Ziheng Wang"}, {"authorId": "2277560905", "name": "Emanuel Adamiak"}, {"authorId": "2277502914", "name": "Alex Aiken"}], "citations": []}
