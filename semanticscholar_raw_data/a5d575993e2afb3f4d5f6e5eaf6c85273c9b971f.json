ICN promises direct retrieval of the content using its unique, persistent, and location-independent name. In ICN, all nodes work together to scale up content delivery, but security issues caused by malicious behaviors of ICN nodes cannot be avoided. To this end, in this article we develop a trust-enhanced blockchain based ICN (BICN) architecture for content delivery. In our proposed architecture, the whole process of content delivery is first traced in an implicitly trusted way by exploiting the excellent properties of the blockchain, so that the malicious ICN nodes can be located. Second, we leverage transactions to record the mapping between human-readable name and self-certifying name in BICN, which supports convenient and trusted alteration for users' requirements. Moreover, we present a case study in BICN based smart grid for energy data delivery, where we perform security analysis and conduct experiments. Numerical results show the superior performance of our proposal. Finally, we present open issues for future work.", "venue": "IEEE Network", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2019-04-11", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Network", "pages": "183-189", "volume": "33"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "46382453", "name": "Huining Li"}, {"authorId": "28014924", "name": "Kun Wang"}, {"authorId": "1718215", "name": "T.
