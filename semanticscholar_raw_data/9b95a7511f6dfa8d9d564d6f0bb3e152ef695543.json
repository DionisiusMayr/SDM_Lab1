We give nearly tight bounds for the communication complexity of this problem, and extend most of our results to larger alphabets. Finally, we prove a lower bound for the VC dimension of a family of classi\ufb01ers that are based on subsequence containment.", "venue": "", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": null, "name": "Mason DiCicco"}, {"authorId": "7240083", "name": "Daniel Reichman"}], "citations": []}
