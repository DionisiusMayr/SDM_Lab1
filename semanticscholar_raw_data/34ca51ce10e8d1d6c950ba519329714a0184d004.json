In this report, we introduce the KwaiYiiMath which enhances the mathematical reasoning abilities of KwaiYiiBase1, by applying Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforced Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), including on both English and Chinese mathematical tasks. Meanwhile, we also constructed a small-scale Chinese primary school mathematics test set (named KMath), consisting of 188 examples to evaluate the correctness of the problem-solving process generated by the models. Empirical studies demonstrate that KwaiYiiMath can achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on GSM8k, CMath, and KMath compared with the similar size models, respectively.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-10-11", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2310.07488"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "47741053", "name": "Jia-Yi Fu"}, {"authorId": "2257102249", "name": "Lei Lin"}, {"authorId": "2257340104", "name": "Xiaoyang Gao"}, {"authorId": "2257393698", "name": "Pengli Liu"}, {"authorId": "2257641962", "name": "Zhengzong Chen"}, {"authorId": "2259972854", "name": "Zhirui Yang"}, {"authorId": "2257401054", "name": "Shengnan Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2257126390", "name": "Xue Zheng"}, {"authorId": "2268314485", "name": "Yan Li"}, {"authorId": "2257123801", "name": "Yuliang Liu"}, {"authorId": "2257428108", "name": "Xucheng Ye"}, {"authorId": "2241998359", "name": "Yiqiao Liao"}, {"authorId": "2239059653", "name": "Chao Liao"}, {"authorId": "2230906921", "name": "Bin Chen"}, {"authorId": "2241686105", "name": "Chengru Song"}, {"authorId": "2257029126", "name": "Junchen Wan"}, {"authorId": "2257134389", "name": "Zijia Lin"}, {"authorId": "2257136363", "name": "Fuzheng Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2257052464", "name": "Zhongyuan Wang"}, {"authorId": "2228125963", "name": "Di Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2238953242", "name": "Kun Gai"}], "citations": []}
