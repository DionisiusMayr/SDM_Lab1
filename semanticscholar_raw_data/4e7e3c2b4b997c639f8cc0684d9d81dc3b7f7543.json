In view of the problem that the traditional cloud storage system lacks flexibility, opacity, weak robustness and cannot effectively store, manage, and maintain big data in data storage, a big data oriented cloud storage system is designed and implemented to intelligently process the business requests of the furniture system through the logic control module. The user access module is used to provide users with various functions realized at the bottom, the storage module is used to provide transparent data access function for the furniture system, and the file read/write module is used to isolate the upper logic processing from the lower storage, so as to make the designed system more robust. In the process of software design, the program code of data cloud storage is given to realize big data cloud storage. The experimental results show that the new generation of network furniture cloud storage systems has high feasibility and practicability.", "venue": "Mathematical Problems in Engineering", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-04-26", "journal": {"name": "Mathematical Problems in Engineering"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2144133216", "name": "Jiayi Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2153000584", "name": "Lin Shi"}], "citations": []}
