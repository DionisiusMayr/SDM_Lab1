Lineage information, including the source datasets, data transformation programs or scripts, or manual annotations, is rarely captured, making it difficult to infer the relationships between artifacts in a given workflow retrospectively. We demonstrate Relic, a tool to retrospectively infer the lineage of data artifacts generated as a result of typical data science workflows, with an interactive demonstration that allows users to input artifact files and visualize the inferred lineage in a web-based setting.
