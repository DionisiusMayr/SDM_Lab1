In IoT there is central server through which information and data passed between the connected devices. This will create many security and privacy issues. Phishing attack, Denial of service attack, false authentication etc are some of the security issues in IoT systems. To solve these issues, central server can be eliminated and technology like Blockchain, where there is no central authority can be adopted. In this paper various use cases of IoT and Blockchain are studied. IoT is vulnerable to many attacks. These vulnerabilities are studied and how blockchain technology and IoT can be integrated to enhance security are also discussed", "venue": "2023 Advanced Computing and Communication Technologies for High Performance Applications (ACCTHPA)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-01-20", "journal": {"name": "2023 Advanced Computing and Communication Technologies for High Performance Applications (ACCTHPA)", "pages": "1-6"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "47895795", "name": "M.
