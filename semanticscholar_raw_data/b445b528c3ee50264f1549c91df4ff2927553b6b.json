First, based on the relevant theories of Library and information management, the target data set is obtained from the data source through data collection and extraction. Then the target data is preprocessed by cleaning, integration and transformation, so as to obtain the data set required for model construction. Finally, the network analysis method is used to establish the data evaluation model and management model, and to evaluate the availability of data. Simulation experiments show that the internal consistency of the data processed by the proposed model is maintained at more than 75%, the accuracy of data classification is high, and the fit between the evaluation index and the evaluation model is maintained at more than 0.83, which can meet the requirements of practical application.", "venue": "J.
