Tree-based namespace structure leads to inefficient file path walk and expensive namespace tree traversal, underutilizing ultra-low access latency and superior sequential performance provided by non-volatile memories (NVMs). This paper proposes FlatFS+, an NVM file system that features a flat namespace architecture while providing a compatible hierarchical namespace view. FlatFS+ incorporates three novel techniques: direct file path walk model, range-optimized Br tree, and compressed index key design with scan and write dual optimization, to fully exploit flat namespace to improve file system metadata performance on ultra-fast, byte-addressable NVMs. Evaluation results demonstrate that FlatFS+ achieves significant performance improvements for metadata-intensive benchmarks and real-world applications compared to other file systems.", "venue": "ACM Transactions on Storage", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-09-06", "journal": {"name": "ACM Transactions on Storage"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2052051828", "name": "Miao Cai"}, {"authorId": "2109764566", "name": "Junru Shen"}, {"authorId": "2186318140", "name": "Bin Tang"}, {"authorId": "2238088525", "name": "Hao Huang"}, {"authorId": "3243858", "name": "Baoliu Ye"}], "citations": []}
