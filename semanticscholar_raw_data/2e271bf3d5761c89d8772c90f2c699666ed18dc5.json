Jobs are submitted one-by-one, without indicating dependencies, and the scheduler considers them independently based on priority, fairness, etc. This paper analyzes hidden inter-job dependencies in a 50k+ node analytics cluster at Microsoft, based on job and data provenance logs, \ufb01nding that nearly 80% of all jobs depend on at least one other job. Yet, even in a business-critical setting, we see jobs that fail because they depend on not-yet-completed jobs, jobs that depend on jobs of lower priority, and other dif\ufb01culties with hidden inter-job dependencies. The Wing dependency pro\ufb01ler analyzes job and data provenance logs to \ufb01nd hidden inter-job dependencies, characterizes them, and provides improved guidance to a cluster scheduler. Speci\ufb01cally, for the 68% of jobs (in the analyzed data lake) that exhibit their dependencies in a recurring fashion, Wing predicts the impact of a pending job on subsequent jobs and user downloads, and uses that information to re\ufb01ne valuation of that job by the scheduler. In simulations driven by real job logs, we \ufb01nd that a traditional YARN scheduler that uses Wing-provided valuations in place of user-speci\ufb01ed priorities extracts more value (in terms of successful dependent jobs and user downloads) from a heavily-loaded cluster. By relying completely on Wing for guidance, YARN can achieve nearly 100% of value at constrained cluster capacities, almost 2 \u00d7 that achieved by using the user-provided job priorities.", "venue": "", "year": null, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2288933101", "name": "Andrew Chung"}, {"authorId": "2289066822", "name": "\u2020.
