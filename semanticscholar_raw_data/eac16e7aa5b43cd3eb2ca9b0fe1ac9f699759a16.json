We dissect various blockchain-enabled CPS as reported in the literature in terms of their operations and the features of blockchain that have been used. We identify key common CPS operations that can be enabled by blockchain, and classify them in terms of their time sensitivity and throughput requirements. We also elaborate and classify features of blockchain in terms of different levels of benefits to CPS, including security, privacy, immutability, fault tolerance, interoperability, data provenance, atomicity, automation, data/service sharing, and trust. Finally, we point out two primary open research issues for developing blockchain-enabled CPS, namely, excessive delay in reaching consensus and limited throughput, and outline future research directions.", "venue": "IEEE Internet of Things Journal", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2020-08-06",
