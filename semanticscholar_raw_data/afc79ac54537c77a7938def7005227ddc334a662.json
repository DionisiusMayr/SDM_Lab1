People utilize Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Google+. Facebook users generate a lot of data. Photos can teach people a lot. Image analysis has traditionally focused on audience emotions. Photographic emotions are essentially subjective and vary among observers. There are numerous uses for its most popular feature. People, on the other hand, use social media and applications. They handle noise, dynamics, and size. Shared text, pictures, and videos were also a focus of network analysis study. Statistic, rules, and trend analysis are all available in massive datasets. You may use them for data manipulation and retrieval, mathematical modeling, and data pre-processing and interpretation. This chapter examines social networks, basic concepts, and social network analysis components. A further study topic is picture usage in social networks. Next, a novel method for analyzing social networks, namely semantic networks, is presented. Finally, themes and routes are defined.", "venue": "Advances in Business Information Systems and Analytics", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "Advances in Business Information Systems and Analytics"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "147590296", "name": "M.
