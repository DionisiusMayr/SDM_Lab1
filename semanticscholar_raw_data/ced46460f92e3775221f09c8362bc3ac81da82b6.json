This paper aims to develop a new framework that integrate e-participation and data science frameworks. Hopefully, this research contributes a new framework of e-Participation using data science approach. The novel framework is collaborating technological and non-technological aspects, multidisciplinary approaches and accommodating the emerging technologies nowadays. This research has implications for theory by adding the new framework into e-Participation, e-Government, Information Systems, Data Science fields. Another important practical implication is that practitioners and decision makers in government could consider elements in the framework to get successful in the technology implementation for supporting citizen participation", "venue": "", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2018-12-01", "journal": {"name": "", "volume": ""}, "authors": [{"authorId": "71955835", "name": "M.
