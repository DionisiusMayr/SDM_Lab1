This work performs the systematic mapping of research in this area and identifies the main opportunities with cellular infrastructure data to support smart city control centers. The methodological process encompasses a sequence of intricately executed stages, including formulating a research protocol, utilizing search engines, rigorous application of inclusion and exclusion criteria, meticulous selection of relevant studies, thorough data validation, and exhaustive synthesis of research outcomes. Thus, 72 papers represent use cases divided into smart services groups from ISO 37122. As a result, Mobility and Urban planning groups presented the most studies and uses, recently increasing the research in other axles, such as Economy, Environment and Climate Change, Health, Social Conditions, and Security. However, there are challenges to overcome to increase smart services to cities.", "venue": "2023 IEEE International Smart Cities Conference (ISC2)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-09-24", "journal": {"name": "2023 IEEE International Smart Cities Conference (ISC2)", "pages": "1-7"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2264489878", "name": "Eder M.
