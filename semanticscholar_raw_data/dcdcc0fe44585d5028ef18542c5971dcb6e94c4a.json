The rapid development of information technology has enabled contact with digital data through the Internet of Things (IoT), smart cities, and the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). Sensor-based urban smart cities are a new paradigm. A smart city monitors the physical world in real time and provides smart services to residents in healthcare, transportation, the environment, and energy. Therefore, there is an increasing requirement for a computationally efficient and secure approach for the sensor-based urban city paradigm. We proposed an efficient lossless data-hiding scheme based on histogram transformation using dynamic quadtree ${N}$ -bit localization for urban sensing networks. The proposed scheme is ideally suited for the security, privacy, and exchange of information in urban sensing networks. The system\u2019s valuation and the comparative study with the existing scheme show that the proposed method is secure and more efficient and obtains high visual qualities (52.23 dB), structural similarity index (SSIM), and embedding capacity ratios.", "venue": "IEEE Sensors Journal", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-03-01", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Sensors Journal", "pages": "5549-5560", "volume": "24"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "145642427", "name": "Rashid Abbasi"}, {"authorId": "47311590", "name": "A.
