It is critical in real-time big data analytics to process data at the point where they are arriving at a quick reaction and good decision making, necessitating the development of a novel architecture that allows for real-time processing at high speed and low latency. Processing and anlayzing a data stream in real-time is critical for a variety of applications; however, handling a large amount of data from a variety of sources, such as sensor networks, web traffic, social media, video streams, and other sources, is a considerable difficulty. The main goal of this paper is to give an overview of the current architecture for real time big data analytics, real-time data stream processing methods available, including their system architectures Lambda, kappa, and delta large data stream processing.", "venue": "European Journal of Information Technologies and Computer Science", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-07-25", "journal": {"name": "European Journal of Information Technologies and Computer Science"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "146085037", "name": "Alaa Hassan"}, {"authorId": "2179794717", "name": "Tarig Mohammed Hassan"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "7c0e410ce1f7532fea82a848bf64c7dcb2ce7231", "title": "The Intertwined Role of Big Data with Business Intelligence and Real Time Analysis: A Finance Sector Perspective"}]}
