This study employs UAV images as data sources to interpret the typical alpine valley area of Beichuan County. Eight environmental factors including a digital elevation model (DEM) are extracted to establish a pixel-wise dataset, along with interpreted landslide data. Two landslide susceptibility models were built, each with a deep neural network (DNN) and a support vector machine (SVM) as the learner, and the DNN model was determined to have the best pre-training performance (accuracy = 88.6%, precision = 91.3%, recall = 94.8%, specificity = 87.8%, F1-score = 93.0%, and area under curve = 0.943), with higher parameters in comparison to the SVM model (accuracy = 77.1%, precision = 80.9%, recall = 87.8%, specificity = 73.9%, F1-score = 84.2%, and area under curve = 0.878). The susceptibility model of Beichuan County is then transferred to Mao County (which has no available dataset) to realize cross-regional landslide susceptibility prediction. The results suggest that the model predictions accomplish susceptibility zoning principles and that the DNN model can more precisely distinguish between high and very-high susceptibility areas in relation to the SVM model.", "venue": "Remote Sensing", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-01-15", "journal": {"name": "Remote.
