Using the differences between the positions and geometric structures of point cloud clusters scanned by the same target in adjacent frame point clouds, the motion states of the point cloud clusters are comprehensively evaluated. To enable the automatic precision pairing of point cloud clusters from adjacent frames of the same target, a double registration algorithm is proposed for point cloud cluster centroids. The iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm is employed for approximate interframe pose estimation during coarse registration. The random sample consensus (RANSAC) and four-parameter transformation algorithms are employed to obtain precise interframe pose relations during fine registration. These processes standardize the coordinate systems of adjacent point clouds and facilitate the association of point cloud clusters from the same target. Based on the paired point cloud cluster, a classification feature system is used to construct the XGBoost decision tree. To enhance the XGBoost training efficiency, a Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficient-bidirectional search for a dimensionality reduction algorithm is proposed to expedite the optimal classification feature subset construction. After preliminary outcomes are generated by XGBoost, a double Boyer\u2013Moore voting-sliding window algorithm is proposed to refine the final LiDAR dynamic target detection accuracy. To validate the efficacy and efficiency of our method in LiDAR dynamic target detection, an experimental platform is established. Real-world data are collected and pertinent experiments are designed. The experimental results illustrate the soundness of our method. The LiDAR dynamic target correct detection rate is 92.41%, the static target error detection rate is 1.43%, and the detection efficiency is 0.0299 s. Our method exhibits notable advantages over open-source comparative methods, achieving highly efficient and precise LiDAR dynamic target detection.", "venue": "Italian National Conference on Sensors", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-02-20", "journal": {"name": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "volume": "24"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2287061862", "name": "Aigong Xu"}, {"authorId": "2288029740", "name": "Jiaxin Gao"}, {"authorId": "2058215097", "name": "Xin Sui"}, {"authorId": "2146408367", "name": "Changqiang Wang"}, {"authorId": "2149562624", "name": "Zhengxu Shi"}], "citations": []}
