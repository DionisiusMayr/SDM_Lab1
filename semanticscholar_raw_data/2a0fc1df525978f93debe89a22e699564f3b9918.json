Unlike existing messaging systems, Mez allows applications to specify latency, and application accuracy bounds. Mez implements a network latency controller that dynamically adjusts the video frame quality to satisfy latency, and application accuracy requirements. Additionally, the design of Mez utilizes application domain specific features to provide low latency operations. Experimental evaluation on an IoT Edge testbed with a pedestrian detection machine vision application indicates that Mez is able to tolerate latency variations of up to 10x with a worst-case reduction of 4.2\\% in the application accuracy F1 score metric.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-09-28", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2009.13549"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1423425625", "name": "Anjus George"}, {"authorId": "145685135", "name": "A.
