It provides a fast and robust technique SURF to build feature descriptors for representing an image. As well, a building index scheme based on unsupervised learning method VP-Tree is also applied to construct a binary search tree for improving the efficiently while searching. Moreover, a locality distance cache is implemented on each processing machine, which maintains distance computations of previous query sessions for approximating the tightness distances between the current query object and objects stored in the database, thus decreasing needed time to process a single query. Especially, a Redis Master/Slave replication model is configured as a collaborative caching service for increasing data availability in the distributed environment. Finally, an MapReduce framework is exploited to retrieve the top-relevant images in searching phase. Regarding to experiments, it showed that our proposed framework achieves both accuracy and low responding time when working on a large dataset.", "venue": "International Conference on Ubiquitous Information Management and Communication", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2017-01-05", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Ubiquitous Information Management and Communication"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "144058515", "name": "Tri D.
