Recently, anomaly detection of the smart grid has attracted a large amount of interest from researchers, and it is widely applied in a number of high-impact fields. Implementing effective anomaly detection for a variety of aberrant behaviors is one of the smart grid's biggest challenges. In the context of smart grids, we provide a scoping overview of research from recent advances in anomaly detection in this work. We categorize our study from numerous aspects for deep understanding and inspection of the research challenges so far. Finally, after analyzing the gap in the reviewed paper, the direction for future research on anomaly detection in smart-grid systems has been provided briefly.", "venue": "2023 IEEE World AI IoT Congress (AIIoT)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-06-04", "journal": {"name": "2023 IEEE World AI IoT Congress (AIIoT)", "pages": "0331-0337"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2062872926", "name": "Shampa Banik"}, {"authorId": "46326854", "name": "Sohag Kumar Saha"}, {"authorId": "69863127", "name": "Trapa Banik"}, {"authorId": "2218573673", "name": "S.
