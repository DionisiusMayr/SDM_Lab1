This paper explores hardware-enforced cyber-security for critical infrastructures. It examines a quantum-safe \u201cSoftware-Defined-Deterministic IIoT\u201d (SDD-IIoT), with a new forwarding-plane (sub-layer-3a) for deterministic M2M traffic flows. A \u201cSoftware-Defined Networking\u201d (SDN) control plane controls many \u201cSoftware-Defined-Deterministic Wide-Area Networks\u201d (SDD-WANs), realized with FPGAs. The SDN control plane provides an \u201cAdmission-Control/Access-Control\u201d system for network-bandwidth, using collaborating Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based \u201cZero Trust Architectures\u201d (ZTAs). Hardware-enforced access-control eliminates all congestion, BufferBloat, and DoS/DDoS attacks, significantly reduces buffer-sizes, and supports ultra-reliable-low-latency communications in the forwarding-plane. The forwarding-plane can: (i) Encrypt/Authenticate M2M flows using quantum-safe ciphers, to withstand attacks by Quantum Computers; (ii) Implement \u201cguaranteed intrusion detection systems\u201d in FPGAs, to detect cyber-attacks embedded within billions of IIoT packets; (iii) Provide guaranteed immunity to external cyber-attacks, and exceptionally strong immunity to internal cyber-attacks; (iv) Save USD 100s of billions annually by exploiting FPGAs; and (v) Enable hybrid Classical-Quantum networks, by integrating a \u201cquantum key distribution\u201d (QKD) network with a classical forwarding plane with exceptionally strong cyber-security, determined by the computational hardness of cracking Symmetric Key Cryptography. Extensive experimental results for an SDD-WAN over the European Union are reported.", "venue": "Information", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-03-22", "journal": {"name": "Information"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2293043916", "name": "Ted H.
