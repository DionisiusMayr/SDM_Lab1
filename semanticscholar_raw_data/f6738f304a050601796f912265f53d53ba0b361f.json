At the same time, it also brings about challenges. The proposal of data theory, the acquisition and analysis of data, and the protection of privacy are all issues that we need to face and solve. First, build a layout optimization simulation program under the background of big data. Follow the procedures of conventional layout optimization simulation, add big data analysis technology to the preliminary analysis, layout optimization simulation design, and later evaluation management, introduce new data processing methods, and build a theoretical framework of landscape optimization simulation methods that integrate new and traditional data. Second, studying the evolution of the landscape image layout of the three-dimensional pastoral complex is different: the overall landscape image layout of the three-dimensional pastoral complex shows a trend of fragmentation and heterogeneity. Among them, the arable land is gradually fragmented, the wetland and water area are simplified in form, the woodland and grassland patches are gradually distributed, the fragmentation is reduced by 76.19%, and the connectivity index is gradually increased. From a spatial perspective, the edge area outside the Fourth Ring Road becomes the most obvious area of fragmentation tendency. Finally, by introducing big data into the landscape layout optimization simulation, a layout optimization simulation method based on big data is constructed and used in the layout optimization simulation of the landscape image layout of the three-dimensional pastoral complex to guide the participatory layout optimization simulation.", "venue": "Complex", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-11-28", "journal": {"name": "Complex.", "pages": "6620216:1-6620216:11", "volume": "2020"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "47725378", "name": "Juan Du"}, {"authorId": "2072952935", "name": "Yuelin Long"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "7043057d3d45a73d4231cf552f6fe6eb0c84f604", "title": "Simulation of Automatic Color Adjustment of Landscape Image Based on Color Mapping Algorithm"}, {"paperId": "aefc327ca685cd06954198d45dcf2827d26da11c", "title": "Landscape Planning and Management Methods of Beautiful Rural Pastoral Complexes under the Background of Big Data"}]}
