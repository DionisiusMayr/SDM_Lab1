To solve these problems, a sliding mode control strategy based on an interval observer is designed. First, an interval observer is designed to obtain the boundary estimation information of the system state online, which is used to reconstruct the load disturbance online. Based on the reconstructed values, an integral sliding mode controller is designed to keep the system frequency stable when the load is disturbed. Then, sensor fault is diagnosed by interval residual. An augmented observer is designed to estimate sensor fault online by equivalent transformation, and the sensor fault is compensated by the fault estimation to reduce the influence of fault on system performance and ensure the reliable and stable operation of the power system. The simulation results show the superiority of the proposed control strategy.", "venue": "Complex", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-02-10", "journal": {"name": "Complex.", "pages": "6271232:1-6271232:14", "volume": "2022"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2109054958", "name": "Xichao Zhou"}, {"authorId": "98568835", "name": "Z.
