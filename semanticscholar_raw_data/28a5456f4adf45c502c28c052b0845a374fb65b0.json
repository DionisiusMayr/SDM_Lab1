Such analytical queries are typically run in a distributed setting, with data being sharded across thousands of nodes for high throughput. However, providing real-time analytics is still a very big challenge; with data distributed across thousands of nodes, the probability that some of the required nodes are unavailable or very slow during query execution is very high and unavailability may result in slow execution or even failures. The sheer magnitude of data and users increase resource contention and this exacerbates the phenomenon of stragglers and node failures during execution. In this paper, we propose a novel solution to alleviate the straggler/failure problem that exploits existing efficient partitioning properties of the data, particularly, co-hash partitioned data, and provides approximate answers along with confidence bounds to queries affected by failed/straggler nodes. We consider aggregate queries that involve joins, group bys, having clauses and a subclass of nested subqueries. Finally, we validate our approach through extensive experiments on the TPC-H dataset.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-02-04", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2002.01531"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2455978", "name": "Bruhathi Sundarmurthy"}, {"authorId": "39655951", "name": "Harshad Deshmukh"}, {"authorId": "22778690", "name": "Paris Koutris"}, {"authorId": "5151034", "name": "J.
