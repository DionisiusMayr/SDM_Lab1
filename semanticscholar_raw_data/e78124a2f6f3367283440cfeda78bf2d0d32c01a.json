Unlike Spark SQL\u2019s optimizer, which mainly relies on a rule-based model, SparkTune adopts a cost-based model for SQL queries; this enables the accurate estimation of execution times and the identification of cost and complexity factors in a user-defined workload. The estimate is based on the cluster configuration, the database statistics (both automatically retrieved by the tool) and the resources allocated to the workload. Thus, for any given cluster, database and workload, SparkTune is able to identify the best cluster configuration to run the workload, to estimate the price to run it on a cloud platform while evaluating the performance/price trade-off, and more. SparkTune turns the cluster tuning efforts from manual and qualitative to automatic, optimized and quantitative.", "venue": "International Conference on Extending Database Technology", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"pages": "546-549"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1824724", "name": "E.
