Mission trends are \ufb01rst analyzed to derive the design drivers for such a system and then the general architecture is analyzed. The target architecture, based on \u201cBig Data\u201d processing architectures is presented, clearly showing how to re-use current data processing state-of-the-art systems for satellite operations. This paper also describes the ongoing developments to integrate standard data mining and arti\ufb01cial intelligence software frameworks in the data acquisition system to develop a complete system capable of acquiring data from multiple sources, autonomously process them and deliver them to users.", "venue": "", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2288743421", "name": "S.
