These can produce fragments of various sizes among data sets. In some cases, these fragments may be serious and harm system performance. In this paper, we manage to modify the current storage mechanism. We introduce an extra storage unit called data bucket into the classical data manage architecture. Next, we modify the data manage mechanism to improve our designs. By keeping data according to their visited information, both the number of fragments and the fragment size are greatly reduced. Considering different data features and storage device conditions, we also improve the solid state drive (SSD) lifetime by keeping data into different spaces. Experiments show that our designs have a positive influence on the SSD storage density and actual service time.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2020-12-25", "journal": {"name": "Journal of Electronic Science and Technology", "pages": "330-340", "volume": "18"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2152122601", "name": "Wei Jiang"}, {"authorId": "2109760002", "name": "Junlong Wang"}, {"authorId": "1754812", "name": "Jinyu Zhan"}, {"authorId": "49403032", "name": "Jinghuan Yu"}, {"authorId": "2108652847", "name": "Haibo Hu"}], "citations": []}
