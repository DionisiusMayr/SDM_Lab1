First, the face image is divided into five levels by a clustering method. Second, the results above are mapped into three hierarchies according to the histogram thresholds. A low, a middle, and a high-intensity block are found. Third, two kinds of linear transforms are performed to the high and the low-intensity blocks. Finally, a center wrap function-based enhancement is carried out. Experiment results show our method can improve both the face recognition accuracy and image quality.", "venue": "Electronics", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2021-04-14", "journal": {"name": "Electronics", "pages": "936", "volume": "10"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2065868809", "name": "N.
