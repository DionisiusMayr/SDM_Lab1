Hence, data collection inside the shop floor is time consuming and probably lack of accuracy since need to be done manually, causes low efficiency in production and delaying in delivery. As a result, it increases the cost in labor and logistics, and further resulting in low competitiveness in market. Therefore, a low cost IoT unit is presented in this research paper, aims to improve productivity and accuracy of manufacturing processes in shop floor. It is required to collect data from production line automatically. From the results, accuracy of data collected by this IoT unit is able to reach about 95% or more during production, and data are transmitted to database wirelessly in real-time. Furthermore, it performs data analysis upon collected, minimize the time gap between processes, optimize the manufacturing processes.", "venue": "2020 13th International UNIMAS Engineering Conference (EnCon)", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2020-10-27", "journal": {"name": "2020 13th International UNIMAS Engineering Conference (EnCon)", "pages": "1-6"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2110211491", "name": "Lu Tang"}, {"authorId": "2070245269", "name": "P.
