However, the existing graph contrastive learning methods rely heavily on selecting negative samples or symmetric network structures. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Data Fusion framework based on Graph Representation Learning for brain disease recognition (DF-GRL), which integrates structure and attribute information extracted from an asymmetric dual branch network. To explore the structure representation of attribute embedding, we sample neighbor node features of attribute embedding. We apply a cross-correlation-based loss function to constrain the structural consistency of structural embedding and neighbor embedding representations. With state-of-the-art graph representation learning methods, extensive experiments on seven brain functional connectivity data demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.", "venue": "2023 4th International Conference on Big Data & Artificial Intelligence & Software Engineering (ICBASE)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-08-25", "journal": {"name": "2023 4th International Conference on Big Data & Artificial Intelligence & Software Engineering (ICBASE)", "pages": "1-5"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2265214447", "name": "Baixue Huang"}, {"authorId": "2265082361", "name": "Hu Lu"}], "citations": []}
