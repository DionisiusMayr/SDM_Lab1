We extract geospatial features such as slope, aspect, and rainfall over Guangxi, China, and apply an extreme gradient boosting model pre-trained on contiguous United States datasets. The model produces susceptibility maps that indicate landslide probability at different scales. However, the lack of accurate data on historical landslides in Guangxi challenges the model evaluation and comparison between regions. To overcome this, we calibrate the model to fit the local conditions in Guangxi. The calibrated model agrees with the observed landslide locations, implying its capability to capture regional variations in landslide mechanisms. We apply the model at a 30 m resolution along the Heba Expressway and validate it against reports from July 2021 to March 2022. The model correctly predicts five of seven landslide events in this period with a reasonable alarm rate. This framework has the potential for large-scale landslide risk management by informing transportation planning and infrastructure maintenance decisions. More data on landslide timing and human disturbance events may improve the model\u2019s accuracy across diverse geographical areas and terrains.", "venue": "Remote Sensing", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-06-30", "journal": {"name": "Remote.
