The methodology has been shown able to improve considerably the accuracy of current positioning estimation systems for real-time Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) autonomous navigation \u2014 which are not robust \u2014 reducing the error in more than 45.19%. However, HACI methodology was found to have a sensitivity to noise in some parts of the estimated trajectories and, therefore, loss of performance. The problem is that none of these recent work assesses the impact of noise present on input signals and the potential benefits of their treatment prior to fusion itself. This is the main contribution of this work. Noise treatment is performed in two approaches: noise removal and noise filtering. It has been shown that for the studied dataset, the noise has a negative impact and that the chosen techniques are capable of adequately handling the noise so as to improve the original GPS precision by almost 57%.", "venue": "IEEE Latin America Transactions", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2019-02-01", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Latin America Transactions", "pages": "295-302", "volume": "18"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "51927760", "name": "\u00c2ngelo de Carvalho Paulino"}, {"authorId": "145712401", "name": "L.
