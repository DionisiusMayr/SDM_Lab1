For this reason, novel methods are necessary to collect, store and analyze data from various data sources as efficiently as possible, while also handling changes in data structures that have occurred as a result of evolution. In this paper, we propose a solution to problems caused by evolution of integrated data sources and information requirements for the data analysis system. Our solution incorporates an architecture that allows to perform OLAP operations and other kinds of analysis on integrated big data and a mechanism for detecting and automatically or semi-automatically propagating changes occured in heterogeneous data sources to a data warehouse.", "venue": "International Conference on Enterprise Information Systems", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"pages": "105-117"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1765642", "name": "Darja Solodovnikova"}, {"authorId": "2047176", "name": "Laila Niedrite"}, {"authorId": "2106438000", "name": "Lauma Svilpe"}], "citations": []}
