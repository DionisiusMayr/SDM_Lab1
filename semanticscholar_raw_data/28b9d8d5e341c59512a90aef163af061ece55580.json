The validity of the AAM-MMSE was assessed in term of the consistency between the AAM-MMSE rating and physician rating.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 427 participants were recruited for this study. The average age of these participants was 60.6 years old (ranging from 19 to 104 years old). According to the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), the interrater reliability between physicians and the AAM-MMSE for the full MMSE scale AAM-MMSE was high [ICC (2,1)=0.952; with its 95% CI of (0.883,0.974)]. According to the weighted kappa coefficients results the interrater agreement level for audio-related items showed high, but for items \"Reading and obey\", \"Three-stage command\", and \"Writing complete sentence\" were slight to fair. The AAM-MMSE rating accuracy was 87% . A Bland-Altman plot showed that the bias between the two total scores was 1.48 points with the upper and lower limits of agreement equal to 6.23 points and -3.26 points.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur work offers a promising fully automated MMSE assessment system for cognitive screening with pretty good accuracy.", "venue": "Journal of Alzheimer's Disease", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-01-29", "journal": {"name": "Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2220133717", "name": "Lihua Chen"}, {"authorId": "2273570194", "name": "Meiwei Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2747202", "name": "Weihua Yu"}, {"authorId": "2273525896", "name": "Juan Yu"}, {"authorId": "2282197233", "name": "Qiushi Cui"}, {"authorId": "2109547710", "name": "Chenxi Chen"}, {"authorId": "2267008355", "name": "Junjin Liu"}, {"authorId": "2219669611", "name": "Lihong Huang"}, {"authorId": "2282345290", "name": "Jiarui Liu"}, {"authorId": "2026969444", "name": "Wuhan Yu"}, {"authorId": "2282347479", "name": "Wenjie Li"}, {"authorId": "2108186252", "name": "Wenbo Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2202225790", "name": "Mengyu Yan"}, {"authorId": "2220128633", "name": "Jiani Wu"}, {"authorId": "2202207374", "name": "Xiaoqin Wang"}, {"authorId": "2107186280", "name": "Jiaqi Song"}, {"authorId": "2141640840", "name": "Fuxin Zhong"}, {"authorId": "2110749816", "name": "Xintong Liu"}, {"authorId": "2282470145", "name": "Xianglin Wang"}, {"authorId": "2282240323", "name": "Chengxing Li"}, {"authorId": "2282237432", "name": "Yuantao Tan"}, {"authorId": "2282237616", "name": "Jiangshan Sun"}, {"authorId": "2282345963", "name": "Wenyuan Li"}, {"authorId": "2113502250", "name": "Yang L\u00fc"}], "citations": []}
