Regression test selection (RTS) aims to speed up regression testing by running only impacted tests\u2014the subset of tests that can change behavior due to code changes. We present STARTS, a tool for STAtic Regression Test Selection. Unlike dynamic RTS, STARTS requires no code instrumentation or runtime information to find impacted tests; instead, STARTS uses only compile-time information. Specifically, STARTS builds a dependency graph of program types and finds, as impacted, tests that can reach some changed type in the transitive closure of the dependency graph. STARTS is a Maven plugin that can be easily integrated into any Maven-based Java project. We find that STARTS selects on average 35.2% of tests, leading to an end-to-end runtime that is on average 81.0% of running all the tests. A video demo of STARTS can be found at https://youtu.be/PCNtk8jphrM.", "venue": "International Conference on Automated Software Engineering", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2017-10-30", "journal": {"name": "2017 32nd IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE)", "pages": "949-954"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "3023790", "name": "Owolabi Legunsen"}, {"authorId": "40128780", "name": "A.
