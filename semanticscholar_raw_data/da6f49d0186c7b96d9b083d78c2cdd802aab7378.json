In this paper, we explore four main typologies (test-based, penalty-based, screening-based, and tree-based) of frequentist variable selection methods in logistic regression setup. Primary objective of this work is to give a comprehensive overview of the existing literature for practitioners. Underlying assumptions and theory, along with the specifics of their implementations, are detailed as well. Next, we conduct a thorough simulation study to explore the performances of fifteen different methods in terms of variable selection, estimation of coefficients, prediction accuracy as well as time complexity under various settings. We take low, moderate and high dimensional setups and consider different correlation structures for the covariates. A real-life application, using a high-dimensional gene expression data, is also included in this study to further understand the efficacy and consistency of the methods. Finally, based on our findings in the simulated data and in the real data, we provide recommendations for practitioners on the choice of variable selection methods under various contexts.", "venue": "", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Mathematics"], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-01-16", "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "12757686", "name": "Souvik Bag"}, {"authorId": "2117809961", "name": "Kapil Gupta"}, {"authorId": "145636652", "name": "S.
