Researchers have proposed extending edge computing to satellites for global low-latency access to application services for, e.g., IoT or metaverses. Building applications for this LEO edge means managing services at large scale on highly dynamic infrastructure, in addition to the usual constraints of edge computing. We seek to develop serverless abstractions for LEO edge applications. We introduce virtual testbed tooling that allows researchers, students, and practitioners to become familiar with the unique characteristics of the LEO edge and develop, test, and benchmark real software in a cost-efficient manner. Further, we develop abstractions for state and data management in geo-distributed edge-to-cloud environments. We then integrate these abstractions with a lightweight FaaS platform to allow building stateful yet scalable applications on the LEO edge. Finally, we propose applications for LEO edge computing to guide the evaluation of our design.", "venue": "Middleware Demos/Posters/Doctoral Symposium", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-12-11", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 24th International Middleware Conference: Demos, Posters and Doctoral Symposium"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "52198091", "name": "Tobias Pfandzelter"}], "citations": []}
