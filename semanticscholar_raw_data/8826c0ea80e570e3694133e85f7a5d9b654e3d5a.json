This trend is caused by widespread adoption of IoT technologies, the data generated by monitoring of cloud computing resources, and cyber physical systems. Although time series data have been a topic of discussion in the domain of data management for several decades, this recent growth has brought the topic to the forefront. Many of the time series management systems available today lack the necessary features to successfully manage and process the sheer amount of time series being generated today. In this today we stive to examine the field and study the prior work in time series management. We then propose a large system capable of handling time series management end to end, from generation to consumption by the end user. Our system is composed of open-source data processing frameworks. Our system has the capability to collect time series data, perform stream processing over it, store it for immediate and future processing and create necessary visualizations. We present the implementation of the system and perform experimentations to show its scalability to handle growing pipelines of incoming data from various sources.", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2021-06-15", "journal": {"name": "", "volume": ""}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2132791671", "name": "Bamdad Mousavi"}], "citations": []}
