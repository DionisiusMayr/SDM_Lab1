Our results reveal that the execution performance in distributed GPU-accelerated task-based workflows highly depends on several interrelated factors regarding the task algorithm, dataset, resources, and system employed. In addition, our analysis identifies key correlations among these factors, presents novel observations, and offers guidelines toward designing an automated method to handle task-based workflows in modern, high-compute capacity, CPU-GPU engines.", "venue": "International Conference on Extending Database Technology", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"pages": "690-703"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2292923830", "name": "Marcos N.
