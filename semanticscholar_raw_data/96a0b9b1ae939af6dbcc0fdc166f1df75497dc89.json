Dietary patterns have been associated with the risk of developing AGT in women post-GDM, but evidence in Asian populations is sparse. This study aimed to determine the association between a posteriori dietary patterns and AGT in women post-GDM. This cross-sectional study recruited 157 women post-GDM (mean age 34.8 years) from Seri Kembangan Health Clinic and Universiti Putra Malaysia. AGT was diagnosed according to the Malaysian Clinical Practice Guidelines using a 75 g 2 h oral glucose tolerance test or HbA1c. Food intake was assessed using the 2014 Malaysian Adult Nutrition Survey food frequency questionnaire. Five dietary patterns were derived using principal component analysis: \u2018Unhealthy\u2019, \u2018Fish-eggs-fruits-vegetables\u2019, \u2018Cereals-confectionaries\u2019, \u2018Legumes-dairy\u2019, and \u2018Meat-sugar-sweetened-beverages\u2019. After adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and total energy intake, the \u2018Cereals-confectionaries\u2019 dietary pattern was significantly associated with AGT (adjusted odds ratio 1.536, p = 0.049). Targeted lifestyle modification, including dietary intervention, for women post-GDM is warranted to reduce their risk of AGT and its complications.", "venue": "Nutrients", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-06-01", "journal": {"name": "Nutrients", "volume": "15"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1403579336", "name": "F.
