However, GNNs exhibit different compute and memory characteristics compared to traditional Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Graph convolutions require feature aggregations from neighboring nodes (known as the aggregation phase ), which leads to highly irregular data accesses. GNNs also have a very regular compute phase that can be broken down to matrix multiplications (known as the combination phase ). All recently proposed GNN accelerators utilize different data\ufb02ows and microarchitecture optimizations for these two phases. Different communication strategies between the two phases have been also used. However, as more custom GNN accelerators are proposed, the harder it is to qualitatively classify them and quantitatively contrast them. In this work, we present a taxonomy to describe several diverse data\ufb02ows for running GNN inference on accelerators. This provides a structured way to describe and compare the design-space of GNN accelerators.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-03-01", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2103.07977"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1576639159", "name": "Raveesh Garg"}, {"authorId": "30667828", "name": "Eric Qin"}, {"authorId": "2065682867", "name": "Francisco Mu\u00f1oz-Mart\u00ednez"}, {"authorId": "1443435337", "name": "Robert Guirado"}, {"authorId": "145620360", "name": "Akshay Jain"}, {"authorId": "3136801", "name": "S.
