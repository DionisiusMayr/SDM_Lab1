In such cases, the lack of early diagnosis and early medical treatment negatively affects the rest of the child\u2019s life. In this context, recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) in the medical field suggest a possible key role also in the cases of preterm birth through the integration of various sources of neurodiagnostic data in order to extract clinical information. In this manuscript, we have addressed the importance of the development of intelligent systems merging with the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) for the analysis of the baby\u2019s movement. More in detail, we here consider a general prototype of an incubator for neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and related tools capable of detecting/measuring vital signs and patient characteristics for newborns with particular attention to preterm infants. In this context, we will also provide a brief explanation of available datasets, such as BabyPose Dataset, MINI-RGBD, and MIA dataset. Furthermore, we will explore data mining techniques and the role of IoMT in the context of preterm infants and children. Finally, emphasis will be placed on technology communication, combination, and multidisciplinary research pursuing more accurate and improved self-guided techniques and systems.", "venue": "DETERMINED", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"pages": "133-146"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2149383932", "name": "Syed Jawad Hussain Shah"}, {"authorId": "2219589106", "name": "Angelo di Terlizzi"}, {"authorId": "145076584", "name": "M.
