These data are often dumped into a centralized repository, e.g., a data lake, consisting of thousands of structured and unstructured datasets. Perversely, such mixture makes the problem of\n discovering\n tables or documents that are relevant to a user's query very challenging. Despite the recent efforts in\n data discovery\n , the problem remains widely open especially in the two fronts of (1) discovering relationships and relatedness across structured and unstructured datasets-where existing techniques suffer from either scalability, being customized for a specific problem type (e.g., entity matching or data integration), or demolishing the structural properties on its way, and (2) developing a holistic system for integrating various similarity measurements and sketches in an effective way to boost the discovery accuracy.\n \n \n In this paper, we propose a new data discovery system, named CMDL, for addressing these two limitations. CMDL supports the data discovery process over both structured and unstructured data while retaining the structural properties of tables. As a result, CMDL is the only system to date that empowers end-users to seamlessly pipeline the discovery tasks across the two modalities. We propose a novel multi-modal embedding representation that captures the similarities between text documents and tabular columns. The model training relies on labeled datasets generated though\n weak supervision\n , and thus the system is domain agnostic and easily generalizable. We evaluate CMDL on three real-world data lakes with diverse applications and show that our system is significantly more effective for cross-modality discovery compared to the search-based baseline techniques. Moreover, CMDL is more accurate and robust to different data types and distributions compared to the state-of-the-art systems that are limited to only the structured datasets.\n", "venue": "Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-06-01", "journal": {"name": "Proc.
