In this paper, we report on an investigation demonstrating the effectiveness and usability of MTKeras through five case studies in the four domains of image classification, sentiment analysis, search engines and database management systems. We also report on the effectiveness of combining metamorphic relation (input) patterns in individual metamorphic relations, enhancing the failure-finding abilities of the individual relations. The results of our experiments support combining patterns, and the use of MTKeras. The research reported in this paper shows the applicability of metamorphic relation patterns, and introduces a practical tool for the research community.", "venue": "International journal of software engineering and knowledge engineering", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-09-01", "journal": {"name": "Int.
