Relegating intermediate data to a second class entity in this manner hurts flexibility, performance, and efficiency. We present WHIZ, a new analytics execution framework that cleanly separates computation from intermediate data. This enables runtime visibility into intermediate data via programmable monitoring, and data-driven computation where data properties drive when/what computation runs. Experiments with a WHIZ prototype on a 50-node cluster using batch, streaming, and graph analytics workloads show that it improves analytics completion times 1.3-2\u00d7 and cluster efficiency 1.4\u00d7 compared to state-of-the-art.", "venue": "Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"pages": "407-423"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2735785", "name": "Robert Grandl"}, {"authorId": "3294190", "name": "Arjun Singhvi"}, {"authorId": "153444196", "name": "Raajay Viswanathan"}, {"authorId": "152426179", "name": "Aditya Akella"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "1079b2a414cd6349fb26b60fab9ae96e84c65280", "title": "Skadi: Building a Distributed Runtime for Data Systems in Disaggregated Data Centers"}, {"paperId": "33196fe8321566ee614c3059b2d8c42eef102e82", "title": "Vineyard: Optimizing Data Sharing in Data-Intensive Analytics"}, {"paperId": "4bff4da2d6ca4e1885bf734a50fe0a72951273c7", "title": "A Reference Architecture for Datacenter Scheduler Programming Abstractions: Design and Experiments (Work In Progress Paper)"}, {"paperId": "aa78cb21326083bdf33fcfbb54f6ad0c7ce808b3", "title": "Multi Resource Scheduling with Task Cloning in Heterogeneous Clusters"}, {"paperId": "30f54721d6fddb8fcd235393d34beda1ed23687c", "title": "Banyan: A Scoped Dataflow Engine for Graph Query Service"}]}
