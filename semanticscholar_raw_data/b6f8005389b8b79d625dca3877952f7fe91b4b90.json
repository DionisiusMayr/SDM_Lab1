IoT received the researchers' attention in the last decade. A plenty of studies have been proposed focused on technical aspects of IoT including protocols, architectures, communication technologies. However, few of them considered the social perspective of this technology. In this paper, we introduce the concept of Internet of Beautiful Things (IoBT) in which we reveal the beauty of utilizing the IoT technology for improving the human behavior. We also present our proposed architecture for IoBT. Different case-studies are demonstrated to support the proposed concept.", "venue": "2019 IEEE Global Conference on Internet of Things (GCIoT)", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2019-12-01", "journal": {"name": "2019 IEEE Global Conference on Internet of Things (GCIoT)", "pages": "1-4"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2078202340", "name": "A.
