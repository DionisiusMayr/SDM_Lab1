Big data, internet of thing (IoT) and data analytics are considered as core competencies in a variety of field. This study proposed an intelligent cloud control system (ICCS) which can provide personalized service for user's requirement. ICCS consisted of sensor/data connectivity, big data maintenance, and third-party service integration. This study demonstrated an educational IoT case by using the ICCS in the learning environment. The experiment result showed that ICCS can successfully conduct an educational IoT solution. From the users' perspective, some assisted functionality may be able to affect their preferences on users' intentions to use big data technology and IoT. In this study, we not only developed an intelligent system but also investigates the user' perception toward IoT and big data. A data source consisting of 139 participants from different industries was employed in the user factor survey. The statistical results show that new technology has been received attention from the users.", "venue": "2017 3rd International Conference on Control, Automation and Robotics (ICCAR)", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering"], "publicationTypes": ["Conference", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2017-04-01", "journal": {"name": "2017 3rd International Conference on Control, Automation and Robotics (ICCAR)", "pages": "727-730"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "40094434", "name": "Y.
