Big data refers to large data volume, complex data sets, and multiple data sources. The recent use of such big data is improving our understanding of interactions between biological systems and global environmental changes. In this review, we first explore how big data has been analyzed to identify the general patterns of biological responses to global changes at scales from gene to ecosystem. After that, we investigate how observational networks and space\u2010based big data have facilitated the discovery of emergent mechanisms and phenomena on the regional and global scales. Then, we evaluate the predictions of terrestrial biosphere under global changes by big modeling data. Finally, we introduce some methods to extract knowledge from big data, such as meta\u2010analysis, machine learning, traceability analysis, and data assimilation. The big data has opened new research opportunities, especially for developing new data\u2010driven theories for improving biological predictions in Earth system models, tracing global change impacts across different organismic levels, and constructing cyberinfrastructure tools to accelerate the pace of model\u2010data integrations. These efforts will uncork the bottleneck of using big data to understand biological responses and adaptations to future global changes.", "venue": "Global Change Biology", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-08-16", "journal": {"name": "Global Change Biology", "pages": "6040 - 6061", "volume": "26"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "6450975", "name": "J.
