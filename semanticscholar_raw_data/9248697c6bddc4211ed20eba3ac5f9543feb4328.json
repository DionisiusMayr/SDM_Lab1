Creativity is called an essential 21st-century skill that should be taught in schools. The use of educational technology to promote creativity is an active study field, as evidenced by several studies linking creativity in the classroom to beneficial learning outcomes. Despite the burgeoning body of research on adaptive technology for education, mining creative thinking patterns from educational data remains a challenging task. In this paper, to address this challenge, we put the first step towards formalizing educational knowledge by constructing a domain-specific Knowledge Base to identify essential concepts, facts, and assumptions in identifying creative patterns. We then introduce a pipeline to contextualize the raw educational data, such as assessments and class activities. Finally, we present a rule-based approach to learning from the Knowledge Base, and facilitate mining creative thinking patterns from contextualized data and knowledge. We evaluate our approach with real-world datasets and highlight how the proposed pipeline can help instructors understand creative thinking patterns from students\u2019 activities and assessment tasks.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-10-12", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2210.06118"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2179451489", "name": "Nasrin Shabani"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "c63010d0e5959392bf3c1a2a847d97e03e26eb0b", "title": "Enhancing creative cognition through project-based learning: An in-depth scholarly exploration"}]}
