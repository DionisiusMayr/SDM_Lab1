The diagnosis is a crucial phase that comes to ensure the implementation of a project adapted to the reality of the city diagnosed; this step requires a significant financial commitment. This paper comes to deploy a frugal diagnostic approach of the smart environment component while using self-learning techniques. In addition, assessments are reported and regulatory maturity with respect to this new concept is explored through machine learning. In the near future machine, learning will play a crucial role in the implementation of this kind of concept.", "venue": "", "year": null, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "79365936", "name": "Adnane Founoun"}, {"authorId": "2261042367", "name": "Mahdi Alaoui Hanafi"}, {"authorId": "144706275", "name": "A.
