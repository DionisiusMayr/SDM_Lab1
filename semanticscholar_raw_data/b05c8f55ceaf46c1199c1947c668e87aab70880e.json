The major drawback of such a system is that the bulky computers used in the system are of high cost and dissipate large power. Moreover, the faculty members need to carry their data in a pen-drive or laptop in order to use in this set up. Spreading of computer virus will happen very easily through pen-drives. Connecting laptop with projector using cable every time is troublesome and can cause damage to connectors and cables. In order to overcome these problems, usage of a Single Board Computer(SBC) in place of the bulky computer is proposed in this work. Faculty members can transfer their files to this SBC through college Local Area Network(LAN). A web-based administrator account is provided on SBC for management and control. In the classroom, an RF-based mini keyboard is used to navigate on the SBC desktop and display files. A wireless screen sharing mechanism from laptops is an added feature for this product. The set-up was tested in a real classroom, and it is found to be a very convenient and easy to use method.", "venue": "2022 IEEE International Conference on Industry 4.0, Artificial Intelligence, and Communications Technology (IAICT)", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-07-28", "journal": {"name": "2022 IEEE International Conference on Industry 4.0, Artificial Intelligence, and Communications Technology (IAICT)", "pages": "71-77"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2102692698", "name": "P.
