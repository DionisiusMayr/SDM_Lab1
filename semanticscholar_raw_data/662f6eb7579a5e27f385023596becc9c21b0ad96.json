Our framework hinges on a special organisation of knowledge base that enables: 1. its efficient population from natural language texts using semi-automated procedures based on Large Language Models, 2. the bumpless generation of temporal parallel plans for multi-robot systems through a sequence of transformations, 3. the automated translation of the plan into an executable formalism (the behaviour trees). The framework is supported by a set of open source tools and is shown on a realistic application.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-09-26", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2309.15049"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1505782467", "name": "Enrico Saccon"}, {"authorId": "2226518423", "name": "Ahmet Tikna"}, {"authorId": "2246843966", "name": "Davide De Martini"}, {"authorId": "1750928845", "name": "Edoardo Lamon"}, {"authorId": "9138004", "name": "Marco Roveri"}, {"authorId": "2246855843", "name": "Luigi Palopoli"}], "citations": []}
