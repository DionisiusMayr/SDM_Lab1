Hence, are explained the features, techniques and tools that compose the state of the art in this recent research line, the result of the union of cloud computing and big data. As a direct benefit, it is sought to shorten the time necessary for effective adoption of big data solutions in organizations. Thus, with the private cloud, the architecture takes advantage of computational resources available in the datacenter to provide the characteristics of cloud computing already popular with major providers. In this way, the study shows an alternative to minimize the problem of deployment, management and configuration complexity in the private cloud environment and big data, allowing the users to use big data solutions with analysis services and data integration services, which will be implemented by means of technologies for batch, real time and NoSQL processing. The results show that the architecture addresses the main use cases of big data systems, enabling features such as scalability, modularity, reusability, use of open standards etc.", "venue": "", "year": 2018, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Sociology"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2018-07-18", "journal": {"name": "", "volume": ""}, "authors": [{"authorId": "32092695", "name": "M.
