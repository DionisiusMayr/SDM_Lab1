Employing a Gaussian-type membership function, AFC first uses all the data samples as microcluster medoids to assign memberships to each other and obtains the membership matrix. Based on this, AFC chooses these data samples that represent local models of data distribution as cluster medoids for initial partition. It then continues to optimize the cluster medoids iteratively to obtain a locally optimal partition as the algorithm output. Moreover, an online extension is introduced to AFC enabling the algorithm to cluster streaming data chunk-by-chunk in a \u201cone pass\u201d manner. Numerical examples based on a variety of benchmark problems demonstrate the efficacy of the AFC algorithm in both offline and online application scenarios, proving the effectiveness and validity of the proposed concept and general principles.", "venue": "IEEE transactions on fuzzy systems", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-06-01", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems", "pages": "2073-2085", "volume": "30"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "4509077", "name": "Xiaowei Gu"}, {"authorId": "143710669", "name": "Q.
