The mission of the HEALTH EDRM RN, whose secretariat is located at the WHO Kobe Centre (WKC), is to promote global research collaboration and strengthen research activities to inform policies and programs by generating new evidence to manage health risks associated with all types of emergencies and disasters. With the strong support and involvement of all WHO regional offices, the HEALTH EDRM RN now works with more than 200 global experts and partners to pursue its mission. The first Core Group Meetings of the HEALTH EDRM RN were held on 17\u201318 October 2019, and concluded with the HEALTH EDRM RN-activity priorities to (1) promote operational research to better meet the needs of emergency- and disaster-exposed individuals and communities and efforts to translate science to policies and programs and (2) strengthen the research capacity of the Health EDRM community. In collaboration with the Japanese Association for Disaster Medicine, the WKC held a workshop on 21 February 2020, in which 20 Japanese experts from different research fields participated to further discuss these two points. This paper summarizes the discussion at the workshop.", "venue": "International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2021-04-22", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health", "volume": "18"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "36684226", "name": "S.
