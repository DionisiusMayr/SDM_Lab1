The world revolves around data to this abundance of data, and data analytics has become very important. A popular method to gather some useful information from data is clustering. Density-based clustering is a subset of Cluster analysis that groups the components according to the spatial density of the objects. The real-world data available or collected is usually mixed in nature, i.e., is comprised of numerical and categorical data types. The standard algorithms are generally designed to handle only a single data type. Many density-based clustering algorithms are implemented on benchmark heterogeneous datasets and compared in this study. The performance of these algorithms is then evaluated using some benchmark evaluation metrics.", "venue": "2023 IEEE International Conference on Contemporary Computing and Communications (InC4)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-04-21", "journal": {"name": "2023 IEEE International Conference on Contemporary Computing and Communications (InC4)", "pages": "1-6", "volume": "1"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2248988537", "name": "Skand Gupta"}, {"authorId": "2223421435", "name": "Vijay Kumar"}], "citations": []}
