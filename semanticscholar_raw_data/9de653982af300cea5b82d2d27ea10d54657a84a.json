In this vision paper, we discuss the potential of a new generation of multi-model database systems as data backends in such settings. Discussing a specific example scenario, we show how this family of database systems allows for agile and flexible schema management. We also identify open research challenges in generating sound triple-views from data stored in interlinked models, as a basis for SPARQL querying. We then conclude with a general overview of multi-model data management systems, to provide a wider scope of the problem domain.", "venue": "Open J.
