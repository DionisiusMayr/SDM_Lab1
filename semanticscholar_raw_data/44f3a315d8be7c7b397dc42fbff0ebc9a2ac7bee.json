Many improvements of file and storage systems are inspired by Workload analysis, which reveals the characteristics of I/O behavior. Although cloud storage systems are becoming increasingly prominent, few real-world and large-scale cloud storage workload studies are presented. Alibaba Cloud is one of the world's largest cloud providers, and we have collected and analyzed workloads from Alibaba for an extended period. We observe that modern cloud network architecture can easily handle the peak load during busy festivals. However, the client layer is the system bottleneck during the peak period, which calls for further optimization. We also find that the workload is heavily skewed toward a small percentage of virtual disks, and its distribution conforms 80/20 rule. In summary, the characteristics of such a large-scale cloud storage system in production environments are important for future cloud storage system modifications.", "venue": "UCC Companion", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-12-06", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 14th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing Companion"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2112561379", "name": "Xiaoyi Sun"}, {"authorId": "2158260044", "name": "Kai Li"}, {"authorId": "2153933116", "name": "Yaodanjun Ren"}, {"authorId": "2144904983", "name": "Jiale Lin"}, {"authorId": "2153693444", "name": "Zhenyu Ren"}, {"authorId": "2153566262", "name": "Shuzhi Feng"}, {"authorId": "144926876", "name": "Jian Yin"}, {"authorId": "1689026", "name": "Zhengwei Qi"}], "citations": []}
