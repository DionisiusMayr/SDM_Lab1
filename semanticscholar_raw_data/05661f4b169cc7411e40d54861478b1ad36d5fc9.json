For these data-driven systems, new fast and efficient hardware methodologies are introduced recently. In this study, a comparison between general purpose RISC-V processor and customized version of it will be presented. Customized version consists of local memory structure, special float computing unit and an interface to communicate with core. It is aimed to show by using the strong sides of these two hardware more efficient and fast architectures can be achieved.", "venue": "International Conference on Electrical and Electronics Engineering", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2021-11-25", "journal": {"name": "2021 13th International Conference on Electrical and Electronics Engineering (ELECO)", "pages": "465-469"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2150708872", "name": "Nazim Altar Koca"}, {"authorId": "2150709262", "name": "Berkay Yildiz"}, {"authorId": "5922026", "name": "Yusuf Demirkol"}, {"authorId": "40809413", "name": "Berna \u00d6rs"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "b2296d07fb949efa6c52f9ea57a7c4f22872710a", "title": "Soc Design of Intelligent Recognition Based on RISC-V"}]}
