The qualitative-documentary method was used, and the quality of the consulted sources was evaluated; the strategies of document review and discrimination of information were applied. The result was the characterization of the properties of OER and how, through their use, skills such as reading comprehension and written language are developed and promoted, essential skills to generate research, research protocols and degree projects, among other products that directly affect the terminal efficiency of postgraduate students. Likewise, the models for the design and construction of OER are defined: Dick and Carey, Morrison, Ross and Kemp, and Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation and Evaluation (ADDIE). Finally, it is concluded that there is a fertile field in the area of systems for the development of educational management methodologies to face the combination that exists between face-to-face and virtual.", "venue": "", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [], "citations": []}
