An electric-double-layer (EDL) formed at the interface between a semiconductor and an electrolyte provided a great potential for building high energy-efficiency PRC. In this Letter, EDL coupled indium-gallium-zinc-oxide (IGZO) artificial synapses are used to implement reservoir computing (RC). Rich reservoir states can be obtained based the ionic relaxation-based time multiplexing mask process. Such an IGZO-based RC device exhibits nonlinearity, fade memory properties, and a low average power of \u223c9.3 nW, well matching the requirement of a high energy-efficiency RC system. Recognition of handwritten digit and spoken-digit signals is simulated with an energy consumption per reservoir state of \u223c1.9 nJ, and maximum accuracy of 90.86% and 100% can be achieved, respectively. Our results show a great potential of exploiting such EDL coupling for realizing a physical reservoir that would underlie a next-generation machine learning platform with a lightweight hardware structure.", "venue": "Applied Physics Letters", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2023-01-23", "journal": {"name": "Applied Physics Letters"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2152917627", "name": "Yang Yang"}, {"authorId": "2189758876", "name": "Hangyuan Cui"}, {"authorId": "2132776618", "name": "Shuo Ke"}, {"authorId": "104896912", "name": "Mengjiao Pei"}, {"authorId": "2189742254", "name": "Kailu Shi"}, {"authorId": "1796829", "name": "C.
