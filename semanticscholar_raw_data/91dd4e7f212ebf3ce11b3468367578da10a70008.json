Text feature selection aims to represent documents using the most relevant features. This process can reduce the size of datasets and improve the performance of the machine learning algorithms. Many researchers have focused on elaborating efficient FS techniques. However, most of the proposed approaches are evaluated for small datasets and validated using single machines. As textual data dimensionality becomes higher, traditional FS methods must be improved and parallelized to handle textual big data. This paper proposes a distributed approach for feature selection based on mutual information (MI) method, which is widely applied in pattern recognition and machine learning. A drawback of MI is that it ignores the frequency of the terms during the selection of features. The proposal introduces a distributed FS method, namely, Maximum Term Frequency-Mutual Information (MTF-MI), based on term frequency and mutual information techniques to improve the quality of the selected features. The proposed approach is implemented on Hadoop using the MapReduce programming model. The effectiveness of MTF-MI is demonstrated through several text classification experiments using the multinomial Na\u00efve Bayes classifier on three datasets. Through a series of tests, the results reveal that the proposed MTF-MI method improves the classification results compared with four state-of-the-art methods in terms of macro-F1 and micro-F1 measures.", "venue": "Scientific Programming", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-04-19", "journal": {"name": "Sci.
