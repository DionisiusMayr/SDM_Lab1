This paper analyzes the use of Learning Management Systems (LMS) in Higher Education and the interactions with their different tools from the students' viewpoint. For the analysis of the student activity statistical techniques and algorithms are extending to be used for big data platform. The information extracted from each student is based both on the events held in each session and on the number of sessions held. The analyzed data belongs to subjects of different modalities (on-campus, blended, online). The results of the methods are compared and discussed regarding the learning modalities. The results are interpreted in a discussion focus obtaining satisfactory knowledge for the identification of patterns of behavior.", "venue": "Australasian Conference on Interactive Entertainment", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2017-08-01", "journal": {"name": "2017 International Conference on Intelligent Environments (IE)", "pages": "44-51"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2069619", "name": "Magdalena Cantabella"}, {"authorId": "1412385157", "name": "Elisabeth Dominguez de la Fuente"}, {"authorId": "1404315006", "name": "Raquel Mart\u00ednez-Espa\u00f1a"}, {"authorId": "22211378", "name": "Bel\u00e9n Ayuso"}, {"authorId": "2117248259", "name": "Andr\u00e9s Mu\u00f1oz"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "0902847868a03e5cc0ab98b28197fe092fd6d4a6", "title": "Automated System Testing for a Learning Management System"}, {"paperId": "a3dcdfd692d495f171bd69181de763b61f52045e", "title": "Fraud Detection and Prevention by using Big Data Analytics"}, {"paperId": "63b388c57a94a14f0ed7c1d7170cd89a0d3b7e54", "title": "An Early-Warning Method on e-Learning"}]}
