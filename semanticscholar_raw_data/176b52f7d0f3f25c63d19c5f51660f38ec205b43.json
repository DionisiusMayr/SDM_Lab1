Whereas much research has been conducted on AI and Blockchain, there is a shortage of comprehensive studies examining their integration from a security perspective. Hence, this survey addresses such a gap and provides insights for policymakers, researchers, and practitioners exploiting AI and Blockchain\u2019s evolving integration. Specifically, this paper analyzes the potential benefits of the integration of AI and Blockchain as well as the related security concerns, identifying possible mitigation strategies, suggesting regulatory measures, and describing the impact it has on public trust.", "venue": "IEEE Access", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "IEEE Access", "pages": "3881-3897", "volume": "12"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2267503404", "name": "Oleksandr Kuznetsov"}, {"authorId": "3264500", "name": "Paolo Sernani"}, {"authorId": "2065802367", "name": "L.
