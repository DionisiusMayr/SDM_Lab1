Emerging technological developments have the potential to address some of the care and support challenges of older people. However, limited work has been done to identify emerging technological developments with the potential to meet the care and support needs of the aging population. Objective This review aimed to gain an overview of emerging technologies with potential care and support applications for older people, particularly for those living at home. Methods A scoping gray literature review was carried out by using the databases of 13 key organizations, hand searching reference lists of included documents, using funding data, and consulting technology experts. A narrative synthesis approach was used to analyze and summarize the findings of the literature review. Results A total of 39 documents were included in the final analysis. From the analysis, 8 emerging technologies were identified that could potentially be used to meet older people\u2019s needs in various care and support domains. These emerging technologies were (1) assistive autonomous robots; (2) self-driving vehicles; (3) artificial intelligence\u2013enabled health smart apps and wearables; (4) new drug release mechanisms; (5) portable diagnostics; (6) voice-activated devices; (7) virtual, augmented, and mixed reality; and (8) intelligent homes. These emerging technologies were at different levels of development, with some being trialed for care applications, whereas others being in the early phases of development. However, only a few documents mentioned including older people during the process of designing and developing these technologies. Conclusions This review has identified key emerging technologies with the potential to contribute to the support and care needs of older people. However, to increase the adoption of these technologies by older people, there is a need to involve them and other stakeholders, such as formal and informal carers, in the process of designing and developing these technologies.", "venue": "JMIR Aging", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business", "Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2019-12-03", "journal": {"name": "JMIR Aging", "volume": "3"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "50507288", "name": "Sarah Abdi"}, {"authorId": "6676439", "name": "L.
