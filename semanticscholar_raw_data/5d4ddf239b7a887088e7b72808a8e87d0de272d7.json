Commonly, the robot requires multiple sensors to map the environment, locate itself, and make a plan to reach the target. However, reinforcement learning methods offer an alternative to map-free navigation tasks by learning the optimal actions to take. In this article, deep reinforcement learning agents are implemented using variants of the deep Q networks method, the D3QN and rainbow algorithms, for both the obstacle avoidance and the goal-oriented navigation task. The agents are trained and evaluated in a simulated environment. Furthermore, an analysis of the changes in the behaviour and performance of the agents caused by modifications in the reward function is conducted.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-02-17", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2302.09120"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2208661074", "name": "Miguel Quinones-Ramirez"}, {"authorId": "1399288941", "name": "Jorge R\u00edos-Mart\u00ednez"}, {"authorId": "2312989", "name": "V\u00edctor Uc Cetina"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "0cb954c2adf32f3b1f12f554bc0ff1e74d08d7aa", "title": "Advancements in Learning-Based Navigation Systems for Robotic Applications in MRO Hangar: Review"}, {"paperId": "98def915135c8d453be2cb39b6a5587790f0a549", "title": "A Review of AI-Enhanced Navigation Strategies for Mobile Robots in Dynamic Environments"}]}
