Five Italian cities (Turin, Milan, Padua, Rome, and Naples) are examined with respect to: 1) urban mobility; 2) land cover and soil consumption at different resolutions; 3) displacement time series. Here we focus on the main outcome of the project, that is the implementation of a collaborative Free and Open Source (FOS) distributed and acentric interoperable geospatial data infrastructure consisting of several components, with respect to land cover and soil consumption. Main features and possible user applications of this platform are illustrated, in the light of the most recent available data.", "venue": "IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-09-26", "journal": {"name": "IGARSS 2020 - 2020 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium", "pages": "4779-4782"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1882834", "name": "M.
