There are two stages involved in the learning process. In the first stage, a coarse-grained generation model is trained to learn response generation under the simplified framework of one-to-one mapping. In the second stage, a fine-grained generation model and an evaluation model are further trained to learn diverse response generation and response coherence estimation, respectively. PLATO-2 was trained on both Chinese and English data, whose effectiveness and superiority are verified through comprehensive evaluations, achieving new state-of-the-art results.", "venue": "Findings", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-06-30", "journal": {"pages": "2513-2525"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2026806395", "name": "Siqi Bao"}, {"authorId": "46350360", "name": "H.
