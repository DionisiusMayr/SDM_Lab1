Such bottlenecks challenge performance for a growing number of important application areas like machine learning and data analytics. While FPGAs denote a promising solution through flexible memory hierarchies and massive parallelism, we argue that current graph processing accelerators either use the off-chip memory bandwidth inefficiently or do not scale well across memory channels. In this work, we propose GraphScale, a scalable graph processing framework for FPGAs. GraphScale combines multi-channel memory with asynchronous graph processing (i. e., for fast convergence on results) and a compressed graph representation (i. e., for efficient usage of memory bandwidth and reduced memory footprint). GraphScale solves common graph problems like breadth-first search, PageRank, and weakly-connected components through modular user-defined functions, a novel two-dimensional partitioning scheme, and a high-performance two-level crossbar design. Additionally, we extend GraphScale to scale to modern high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and reduce partitioning overhead of large graphs with binary packing.", "venue": "ACM Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-09-13", "journal": {"name": "ACM Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1411128014", "name": "Jonas Dann"}, {"authorId": "2239108053", "name": "Daniel Ritter"}, {"authorId": "2239130687", "name": "Holger Fr\u00f6ning"}], "citations": []}
