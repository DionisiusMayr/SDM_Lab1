In order to facilitate the operators of electric power system to obtain energy data quickly and directly, the actual needs of integrated construction of electric power will be considered and the dynamic visualization system of comprehensive energy data of electric power for integrated construction will be designed. The core control module and communication module of the system are designed with MCM5912, which has high-speed processing performance, as the core. Under the hardware support, the B/S architecture is used as the basis for software development, and the Radviz visualization technology is improved by using ant colony algorithm and annealing simulation to realize the dynamic display of energy data. The system performance test results show that the response time of the system remains within 6s under a large volume of service requests, which meets the practicality requirements.", "venue": "International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Advanced Manufacturing", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book"], "publicationDate": "2021-10-23", "journal": {"name": "2021 3rd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Advanced Manufacture"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2111078954", "name": "Shaodong Zhao"}], "citations": []}
