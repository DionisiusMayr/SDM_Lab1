After a failure is detected/diagnosed/predicted, operators still have to inspect the raw logs to gain a summarized view before take actions. However, manual or rule-based log summarization has become inefficient and ineffective. In this work, we propose LogSummary, an automatic, unsupervised end-to-end log summarization framework for online services. LogSummary obtains the summarized triples of important logs for a given log sequence. It integrates a novel information extraction method taking both semantic information and domain knowledge into consideration, with a new triple ranking approach using the global knowledge learned from all logs. Given the lack of a publicly-available gold standard for log summarization, we have manually labelled the summaries of four open-source log datasets and made them publicly available. The evaluation on these datasets as well as the case studies on real-world logs demonstrate that LogSummary produces a highly representative (average ROUGE F1 score of 0.741) summaries. We have packaged LogSummary into an open-source toolkit and hope that it can benefit for future NLP-powered summarization works.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-12-16", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2012.08938"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1504993031", "name": "Weibin Meng"}, {"authorId": "1443837341", "name": "Federico Zaiter"}, {"authorId": "1739753031", "name": "Yuheng Huang"}, {"authorId": "100576967", "name": "Y.
