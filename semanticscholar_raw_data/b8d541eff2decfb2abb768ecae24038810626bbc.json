However, data analytics at the edge introduces numerous security risks that can impact the data being processed. Thus, safeguarding sensitive data from being exposed to illegitimate users is crucial to avoiding uncertainties and maintaining the overall quality of the service offered. Most existing edge security models have considered attacks during data analysis as an afterthought. In this paper, an overview of edge data analytics in healthcare, traffic management, and smart city use cases is provided, including the possible attacks and their impacts on edge data analytics. Further, existing models are investigated to understand how these attacks are handled and research gaps are identified. Finally, research directions to enhance data analytics at the edge are presented.", "venue": "IoT", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2024-03-05", "journal": {"name": "IoT"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2143011119", "name": "Poornima Mahadevappa"}, {"authorId": "1413214138", "name": "Redhwan Al-amri"}, {"authorId": "9326358", "name": "G.
