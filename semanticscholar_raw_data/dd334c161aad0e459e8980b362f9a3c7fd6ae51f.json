Tasks like generating urban planning texts, retrieving related information, and evaluating planning documents pose unique challenges. To enhance the efficiency of urban professionals and overcome these obstacles, we introduce PlanGPT, the first specialized Large Language Model tailored for urban and spatial planning. Developed through collaborative efforts with institutions like the Chinese Academy of Urban Planning, PlanGPT leverages a customized local database retrieval framework, domain-specific fine-tuning of base models, and advanced tooling capabilities. Empirical tests demonstrate that PlanGPT has achieved advanced performance, delivering responses of superior quality precisely tailored to the intricacies of urban planning.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2024, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-02-29", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2402.19273"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2288349921", "name": "He Zhu"}, {"authorId": "2288169179", "name": "Wenjia Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2288271167", "name": "Nuoxian Huang"}, {"authorId": "2288385465", "name": "Boyang Li"}, {"authorId": "2288262756", "name": "Luyao Niu"}, {"authorId": "2289334622", "name": "Zipei Fan"}, {"authorId": "2288260085", "name": "Tianle Lun"}, {"authorId": "2289854071", "name": "Yicheng Tao"}, {"authorId": "2288330751", "name": "Junyou Su"}, {"authorId": "2288221911", "name": "Zhaoya Gong"}, {"authorId": "2288340097", "name": "Chenyu Fang"}, {"authorId": "2288249218", "name": "Xing Liu"}], "citations": []}
