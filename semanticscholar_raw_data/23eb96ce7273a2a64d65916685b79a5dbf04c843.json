Development of renewable blue energy based on the emerging promising triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG) has become an important direction of future energy development. The solid-liquid contact triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) has the advantages of flexible structure, easy manufacture, and long-term stability, which makes it easier to integrate and achieve large-scale conversion of wave mechanical energy. However, the electric power output is still not large enough, which limits its practical applications. In this work, a nanocomposite electret layer enhanced solid-liquid contact triboelectric nanogenerator (E-TENG) is proposed for water wave energy harvesting, which can effectively improve the electric output and achieve real-time power supply of wireless sensing. Through introducing a nanocomposite electret layer into flexible multilayer solid-liquid contact TENG, higher power output is achieved. The E-TENG (active size of 50\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a049\u00a0mm) shows desired output performance, a power density of 521\u00a0mW\u00a0m-2 . The generated electric energy can drive wireless temperature sensing by transmitting wireless signals carrying detection information at the period of \u02c25.5\u00a0min. This research greatly improves the electric output and provides a solid basis for the industrialization of TENG in blue energy.", "venue": "Small", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-12-31", "journal": {"name": "Small", "pages": "\n          e2310023\n        "}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2277568031", "name": "Xue Jiao Zhao"}, {"authorId": "2113222228", "name": "Hai Lu Wang"}, {"authorId": "2277603166", "name": "Zhong Lin Wang"}, {"authorId": "2146041391", "name": "Jie Wang"}], "citations": []}
