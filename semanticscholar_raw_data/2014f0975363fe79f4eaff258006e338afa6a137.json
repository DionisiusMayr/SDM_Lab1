This paper introduces Glinda, which combines these three approaches by providing a live programming experience, with interactive results, for a domain-specific language for data science. The language\u2019s compiler uses an open-ended set of \u201crecipes\u201d to execute steps in the user\u2019s data science workflow. Each recipe is intended to combine the expressiveness of a written notation with the ease-of-use of a GUI. Live programming provides immediate feedback to a user\u2019s input, whether in the form of program edits or GUI gestures. In a qualitative evaluation with 12 professional data scientists, participants highly rated the live programming and interactive results. They found the language productive and sufficiently expressive and suggested opportunities to extend it.", "venue": "International Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2021-05-06", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 2021 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1710751", "name": "R.
