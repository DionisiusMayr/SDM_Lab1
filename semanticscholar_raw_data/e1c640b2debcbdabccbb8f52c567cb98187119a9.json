The centralized resource management system is not scalable for large-scale servers as the number of users running on shared resources is increasing dramatically and the centralized manager may not have enough information about applications' need. In this paper we propose a distributed game-theoretic resource management approach using market auction mechanism to find optimal strategy in a resource competition game. The applications learn through repeated interactions to choose their action on choosing the shared resources. Specifically, we look into two case studies of cache competition game and main processor and co-processor congestion game. We enforce costs for each resource and derive bidding strategy. Accurate evaluation of the proposed approach show that our distributed allocation is scalable and outperforms the static and traditional approaches.", "venue": "ICCD", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2017-11-01", "journal": {"name": "2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)", "pages": "161-164"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2487483", "name": "D.
