However, recognizing multiple people\u2019s activities is still challenging due to the complexity of their activities, such as parallel and collaborative activities. To address these challenges, we propose a transformer with a bidirectional gated recurrent unit (GRU) deep learning (DL) method, called TRANS-BiGRU, to efficiently learn and recognize different types of activities performed by multiple residents. We compare the proposed model with the state-of-the-art models and various DL models, such as Ensemble2LSTM (Ens2-LSTM), bidirectional GRUs (Bi-GRU), and traditional machine learning (ML) models, such as support vector machine (SVM). Our experimental results based on the center for advanced studies in adaptive system and ARAS public data sets show that our model significantly outperforms the existing models for complex activity recognition of multiple residents.", "venue": "IEEE Internet of Things Journal", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-12-01", "journal": {"name": "IEEE Internet of Things Journal", "pages": "23716-23727", "volume": "9"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2158194196", "name": "Dong Chen"}, {"authorId": "1801191", "name": "Sira Yongchareon"}, {"authorId": "47237254", "name": "E.
