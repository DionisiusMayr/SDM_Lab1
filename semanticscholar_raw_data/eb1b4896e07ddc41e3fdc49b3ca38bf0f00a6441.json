In those complex frameworks, optimizing codeby hand is hard and time-consuming, making automated optimization particularly necessary. In order to automate optimization, a prerequisite isto find suitable abstractions to represent programs; for instance, algebras based on monads or monoids to represent distributed data collections.Currently, however, such algebras do not represent recursive programs in a way which allows analyzing or rewriting them. In this paper, we extend a monoid algebra with a fixpoint operator for representing recursion as a first class citizen and show how it allows new optimizations. Experiments with the Spark platform illustrate performance gains brought by these systematic optimizations", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2020-10-16", "journal": {"name": "", "volume": ""}, "authors": [{"authorId": "150293437", "name": "Sarah Chlyah"}, {"authorId": "3166816", "name": "N.
