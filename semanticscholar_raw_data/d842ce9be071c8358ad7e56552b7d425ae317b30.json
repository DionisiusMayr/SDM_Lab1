As the volume of data to be processed increases rapidly, there is a pressing need for processing them across multiple geo-distributed datacenters. However, these frameworks are not designed to take limited and varying inter-datacenter bandwidth into account, leading to longer query latencies.In this paper, we focus on reducing latencies for spark streaming queries in wide-area networks, by automatically selecting data flow routes and determining micro-batch sizes across geo-distributed datacenters. Specifically, we formulate a nonconvex optimization problem, and solve it with an efficient heuristic algorithm based on readily measurable operating traces. We conducted experiments on Amazon EC2 with emulated bandwidth constraints. Our experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm, as compared to the existing Spark Streaming.", "venue": "International Conference on Automation and Computing", "year": 2017, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2017-07-01", "journal": {"name": "2017 IEEE International Conference on Autonomic Computing (ICAC)", "pages": "33-38"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2108651293", "name": "Wenxin Li"}, {"authorId": "1714907", "name": "Di Niu"}, {"authorId": "2108098194", "name": "Yinan Liu"}, {"authorId": "8603167", "name": "Shuhao Liu"}, {"authorId": "91269142", "name": "Baochun Li"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "553d45a20138624247776ac7b678d5d6192a7772", "title": "Low-Latency Video Conferencing System for Geo-Distributed Data Centers"}, {"paperId": "7e18f02a7097b8a56182a44dbe243a10b11f95cf", "title": "DAG-Aware Optimization for Geo-Distributed Data Analytics"}, {"paperId": "59787dec987401bc9595a27837fb620a451b0ae6", "title": "Lightweight Stream Processing Framework Based on Distributed Power Terminals"}, {"paperId": "4b800119b57bf66a66873765e621c94c92a93c93", "title": "Delay-Resistant Geo-Distributed Analytics"}, {"paperId": "eb4f4c96430b41a81bd6a8be1ee3ee7d436d11e0", "title": "SDN-enabled Resource Provisioning Framework for Geo-Distributed Streaming Analytics"}, {"paperId": "ea4e321de6163db57106757119c90c308a51c5e0", "title": "A survey on bandwidth-aware geo-distributed frameworks for big-data analytics"}, {"paperId": null, "title": "2020 Index IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems Vol. 31"}, {"paperId": "2df5a82ced15a92536723ceae61c4d985857793c", "title": "ImRP: A Predictive Partition Method for Data Skew Alleviation in Spark Streaming Environment"}, {"paperId": "213a83e61e1347ffa58da9383a4bf92f4a77a6c8", "title": "Real-time intelligent big data processing: technology, platform, and applications"}, {"paperId": "5ce46ddaac2dca26a9cf5e40d9211e8b2177e173", "title": "Wide-Area Spark Streaming: Automated Routing and Batch Sizing"}, {"paperId": "a1fc1b98b84543499c93b3cc4f1a5ebafdf59add", "title": "Unsupervised Real-Time Stream-Based Novelty Detection Technique an Approach in a Corporate Cloud"}, {"paperId": "35f3f2a49722a44258c664ac1308bfcbedcd70b6", "title": "Optimizing Windowed Aggregation over Geo-Distributed Data Streams"}]}
