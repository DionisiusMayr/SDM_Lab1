We designed a geographically diverse, prospective registry to study the disease course among patients with 1 of 4 inflammatory conditions of the pouch. The primary objectives in this study were to demonstrate the feasibility of a prospective pouch registry and to evaluate the predominant treatment patterns for pouch-related disorders. Methods We used standardized diagnostic criteria to prospectively enroll patients with acute pouchitis, chronic antibiotic-dependent pouchitis (CADP), chronic antibiotic refractory pouchitis (CARP), or Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) of the pouch. We obtained detailed clinical and demographic data at the time of enrollment, along with patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures. Results We enrolled 318 patients (10% acute pouchitis, 27% CADP, 12% CARP, and 51% CD of the pouch). Among all patients, 55% were on a biologic or small molecule therapy. Patients with CD of the pouch were more likely to use several classes of therapy (P < .001). Among patients with active disease at the time of enrollment, 23% with CARP and 40% with CD of the pouch were in clinical remission at 6 months after enrollment. Conclusions In a population where most patients had refractory inflammatory conditions of the pouch, we established a framework to evaluate PROs and clinical effectiveness. This infrastructure will be valuable for long-term studies of real-world effectiveness for pouch-related disorders.", "venue": "Crohn's & Colitis 360", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-07-01", "journal": {"name": "Crohn's & Colitis 360", "volume": "4"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "143643521", "name": "E.
