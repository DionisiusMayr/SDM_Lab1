Platforms built to foster social interaction and engagement have enabled historically disenfranchised groups to have a voice. One such vulnerable group is women. In this paper, we explore the diversity in online women\u2019s ideological spaces using a multi-dimensional approach. We perform a large-scale, data-driven analysis of over 6M Reddit comments and submissions from 14 subreddits. We elicit a diverse taxonomy of online women\u2019s ideological spaces, ranging from counterparts to the so-called Manosphere to Gender-Critical Feminism. We then perform content analysis, finding meaningful differences across topics and communities. Finally, we explore two platforms, namely, ovarit.com and thepinkpill.co, where two toxic communities of online women\u2019s ideological spaces (Gender-Critical Feminism and Femcels) migrated after their ban on Reddit.", "venue": "Web Science Conference", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Book"], "publicationDate": "2023-03-13", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 15th ACM Web Science Conference 2023"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1931977146", "name": "Utkucan Balci"}, {"authorId": "2059988259", "name": "Chen Ling"}, {"authorId": "80970139", "name": "Emiliano De Cristofaro"}, {"authorId": "3314746", "name": "Megan Squire"}, {"authorId": "2350947", "name": "G.
