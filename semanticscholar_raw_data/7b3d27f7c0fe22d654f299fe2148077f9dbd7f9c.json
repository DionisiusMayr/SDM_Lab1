The preprocessing stage requires sequencing and alignment tools that provide barcoding for error correction and increase accuracy during sequencing. Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs) promise a highly accurate bioinformatic identification of PCR duplication before the amplification stage. However, using alignment coordinates alone is Data-intensiveand challenging due to the increased demand for computational throughput, affecting the performance of the underlying resources. This paper proposes a highly scalable data scheduling and resource allocation framework called OPERA-gSAM for the genome Sequence Alignment Map (SAM). OPERA-gSAM, an OPportunistic and Elastic Resource Allocation, is an enabling big data platform (i.e., Apache Spark) for the next-generation massively parallel sequencing applications. We validate OPERA-gSAM scalability and efficiency using Genomics single-cell RNA sequencing. Our experiments demonstrate the usability and high efficiency of the proposed framework. Results show that OPERA-gSAM is up to 2.4\u00d7 faster while consuming 50% fewer resources than the conventional pipeline using SAM and UMI tools.", "venue": "2023 IEEE/ACM 23rd International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Internet Computing Workshops (CCGridW)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-05-01", "journal": {"name": "2023 IEEE/ACM 23rd International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Internet Computing Workshops (CCGridW)", "pages": "160-167"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1820448928", "name": "P.
