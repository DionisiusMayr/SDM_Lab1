However, the distributed nature of big data technologies makes it time-consuming to process typical analytical queries, especially those involving aggregate and join operations, preventing business users from performing efficient data exploration. In this sense, a workload-driven approach for automatic view selection was devised, aimed at speeding up analytical queries issued against distributed dimensional data. This paper presents a detailed description of the proposed approach, along with an extensive evaluation to test its feasibility. Experimental results shows that the conceived mechanism is able to automatically derive a limited but comprehensive set of views able to reduce query processing time by up to 89%\u201398%.", "venue": "International Conference on Internet of Things, Big Data and Security", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2019-10-17", "journal": {"pages": "17-28"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1405534118", "name": "Leandro Ordo\u00f1ez-Ante"}, {"authorId": "2720187", "name": "Gregory van Seghbroeck"}, {"authorId": "145115855", "name": "T.
