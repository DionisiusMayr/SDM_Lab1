Constructing the intensive database resource distribution structure model and analyzing the statistical data of intensive database resources, combined with the fuzzy comprehensive clustering method to carry out the information clustering processing of intensive database resources, is the core framework for dealing with the data analysis problems proposed in this article. In the wildcard-based ciphertext search solution, the server needs to send the matched file to the user completely. If the user cannot get the desired file after decryption, it needs to be sent again. To overcome this challenge, we use the retrieval model to construct the efficient cloud model. The collection ways are simulated through the experimental simulations.", "venue": "2021 5th International Conference on Trends in Electronics and Informatics (ICOEI)", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2021-06-03", "journal": {"name": "2021 5th International Conference on Trends in Electronics and Informatics (ICOEI)", "pages": "1170-1173"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2047150647", "name": "Cuihua Li"}], "citations": []}
