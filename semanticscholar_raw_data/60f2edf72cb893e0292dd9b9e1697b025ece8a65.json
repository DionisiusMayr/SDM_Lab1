Several efforts have been carried out to enhance dexterous hand\nprosthesis control by impaired individuals. However, the control robustness offered by scienti\uf001c research is still not suf\uf001cient for\nmany real life applications, and commercial prostheses are capable of offering natural control for only a few movements. This\npaper reviews various papers on deep learning approaches to the control of prosthetic hands with EMG signals and made a\ncomparison on their accuracy.", "venue": "Global Journal For Research Analysis", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2021-08-15", "journal": {"name": "GLOBAL JOURNAL FOR RESEARCH ANALYSIS"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2181169651", "name": "Shahanaj Parveen"}, {"authorId": "30591008", "name": "Nisheena V.
