Therefore, research into intrusion detection has become very important for network security. Methods In this paper, a clustering algorithm based on the symbiotic-organism search (SOS) algorithm and a Kohonen neural network is proposed. Results The clustering accuracy of the Kohonen neural network is improved by using the SOS algorithm to optimize the weights in the Kohonen neural network. Discussion Our approach was verified with the KDDCUP99 network intrusion data. The experimental results show that SOS-Kohonen can effectively detect intrusion. The detection rate was higher, and the false alarm rate was lower.", "venue": "Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-02-22", "journal": {"name": "Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience", "volume": "17"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "144576585", "name": "Guo Zhou"}, {"authorId": "20913663", "name": "Fahui Miao"}, {"authorId": "2004960257", "name": "Zhonghua Tang"}, {"authorId": "3274637", "name": "Yongquan Zhou"}, {"authorId": "3208798", "name": "Qifang Luo"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "11be61de935d0700aac99800e7c59f1c6689ca3f", "title": "Annotate and retrieve in vivo images using hybrid self-organizing map"}, {"paperId": "c0a3d43793b5a0be0a175f089c9d82ff969a3886", "title": "An Improved Cuckoo Search Algorithm for Optimization of Artificial Neural Network Training"}, {"paperId": "ae03a06d22604d13056f0c6294e7b1f2f93b5e27", "title": "Application of GA-WELM Model Based on Stratified Cross-Validation in Intrusion Detection"}, {"paperId": "bbfb899a01480bfa7831a6f2316e1c7793de79a6", "title": "Design of Intelligent Neuro-Supervised Networks for Brain Electrical Activity Rhythms of Parkinson\u2019s Disease Model"}]}
