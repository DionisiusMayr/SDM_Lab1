We adopted two well-known algorithms from data mining techniques which are association rules mining and K-means clustering. Apriori together with k-means were used in our proposed methodology. After performing the method, we tried our theory on the machines. The results from the real-word experiment showed that there were only 25% of new products that were in low value segment after applied our method while there were 67% before the usage.", "venue": "Data Storage and Data Engineering", "year": 2019, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2019-06-15", "journal": {"name": "Proceedings of the 2019 2nd International Conference on Data Storage and Data Engineering  - DSDE 2019"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "1396083920", "name": "Peeraya Wasutanachai"}, {"authorId": "144484556", "name": "Kun-Ming Yu"}, {"authorId": "2661420", "name": "Yi-Hui Chiang"}, {"authorId": "48849235", "name": "Wen Ouyang"}, {"authorId": "2118387877", "name": "Yen-Chiu Chen"}], "citations": []}
