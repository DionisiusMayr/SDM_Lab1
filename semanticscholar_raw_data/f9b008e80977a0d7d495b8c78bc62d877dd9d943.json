Dated 13,600\u201313,300 cal BP, these are the earliest known examples of osseous rod technology in the Americas. Beveled ivory, antler, and bone rods and points share technological similarities between Upper Paleolithic Europe, Asia, eastern Beringia, and the Clovis tradition of North America and are important tool types in understanding the late Pleistocene dispersal of modern humans. The Holzman finds are comparable to well-known Clovis tradition artifacts from Anzick (Montana), Blackwater Draw (New Mexico), East Wenatchee (Washington), and Sherman Cave (Ohio). We describe these tools in the broader context of late Pleistocene osseous technology with implications for acquisition and use of mammoth ivory in eastern Beringia and beyond.", "venue": "American Antiquity", "year": 2021, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Geography"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2021-10-14", "journal": {"name": "American Antiquity", "pages": "59 - 79", "volume": "87"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "104436844", "name": "Brian T.
