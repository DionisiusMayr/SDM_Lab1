The vast training data required to train these architectures aggregates many different styles, tones, and qualities. Using that data to train a single model makes it difficult to use the model as a consistent conversational agent, e.g. with a stable set of persona traits and a typical style of expression. Several architectures affording control mechanisms over generation architectures have been proposed, each with different trade-offs. However, it remains unclear whether their use in dialogue is viable, and what the trade-offs look like with the most recent state-of-the-art conversational architectures. In this work, we adapt three previously proposed controllable generation architectures to open-domain dialogue generation, controlling the style of the generation to match one among about 200 possible styles. We compare their respective performance and tradeoffs, and show how they can be used to provide insights into existing conversational datasets, and generate a varied set of styled conversation replies.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-09-22", "journal": {"name": "ArXiv", "volume": "abs/2009.10855"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "51324296", "name": "Eric Michael Smith"}, {"authorId": "1400416878", "name": "Diana Gonzalez-Rico"}, {"authorId": "31461304", "name": "Emily Dinan"}, {"authorId": "90841478", "name": "Y-Lan Boureau"}], "citations": [{"paperId": "a98e51bf1de2b2d99ca75b9e8a2c983fcbe6f2c6", "title": "Towards Safety and Helpfulness Balanced Responses via Controllable Large Language Models"}, {"paperId": "d95bf07bf21d8c17810da9c1f87190257d757b05", "title": "Developing Safe and Responsible Large Language Models -- A Comprehensive Framework"}, {"paperId": "9b3a76d3a5f48080c31cd123f9d3899081d32577", "title": "FollowBench: A Multi-level Fine-grained Constraints Following Benchmark for Large Language Models"}, {"paperId": "91b5d8287e2353f667f90641e3d930cc5ee0942e", "title": "Evaluating Large Language Models on Controlled Generation Tasks"}, {"paperId": "e6776f5f293c18f4b2322b1479f083cb24d33343", "title": "SteerLM: Attribute Conditioned SFT as an (User-Steerable) Alternative to RLHF"}, {"paperId": "4bd35d344c635b05f97f4d749741d196ff541bf3", "title": "A Primer on Seq2Seq Models for Generative Chatbots"}, {"paperId": "d95b441c2838888d7ac1af73b5f9c800f22fad3a", "title": "An Invariant Learning Characterization of Controlled Text Generation"}, {"paperId": "bc5d449144aef50ad240ce0ca9e1182abd94e45f", "title": "Context-Aware Document Simplification"}, {"paperId": "79e1324fc74dfd45ea8a7ca7b9fd0a12c1e09218", "title": "Safer Conversational AI as a Source of User Delight"}, {"paperId": "ee8461e4f5ec7522c5fa4efb9dbdb3b307686812", "title": "Topic-switch adapted Japanese Dialogue System based on PLATO-2"}, {"paperId": "5970fd7b57a0a9ad317a59498719bee747dd30b6", "title": "An Empirical Study of Metrics to Measure Representational Harms in Pre-Trained Language Models"}, {"paperId": "529548ce8485daac29dbead20c4c383d965ae1d6", "title": "Improving Chess Commentaries by Combining Language Models with Symbolic Reasoning Engines"}, {"paperId": "22d34b881d64523da54f13d01fc3c6d93a8412e3", "title": "Dungeons and Dragons as a Dialog Challenge for Artificial Intelligence"}, {"paperId": "609ec8e18b8128e2474b5c96132b63105a5a5e73", "title": "Every picture tells a story: Image-grounded controllable stylistic story generation"}, {"paperId": "bccfcca7b28c4792bd59659c56e1d7843542dfe9", "title": "Attention Biasing and Context Augmentation for Zero-Shot Control of Encoder-Decoder Transformers for Natural Language Generation"}, {"paperId": "017cfe49fce1cb77bda2e1791f7203f5ebac0ac7", "title": "Director: Generator-Classifiers For Supervised Language Modeling"}, {"paperId": "7ef43bacd43393ff116e6fcda6a52a6902e016d7", "title": "\u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that\u201d: Finding New Biases in Language Models with a Holistic Descriptor Dataset"}, {"paperId": "a8e510680ecbf5ad1fa32a486b3135f9886a6c2f", "title": "Building a Role Specified Open-Domain Dialogue System Leveraging Large-Scale Language Models"}, {"paperId": "aab1dead436211a7d9eb7a717ee63a5d23cf23f0", "title": "Meet Your Favorite Character: Open-domain Chatbot Mimicking Fictional Characters with only a Few Utterances"}, {"paperId": "530dbd3247bdec8ee9b2513ebbe6b6df5e4d6055", "title": "Stylized Knowledge-Grounded Dialogue Generation via Disentangled Template Rewriting"}, {"paperId": "6d23532a1e9a8116041fd5aac6b0ef8ddd6d8171", "title": "The Moral Integrity Corpus: A Benchmark for Ethical Dialogue Systems"}, {"paperId": "fc14091bbd7d1eb2c9f23ff9c75a4222f2604143", "title": "Neural Natural Language Generation: A Survey on Multilinguality, Multimodality, Controllability and Learning"}, {"paperId": "82bd7dbd3ba9926c48704957397f013fda3a3d22", "title": "Symbolic music generation conditioned on continuous-valued emotions"}, {"paperId": "827a67bbb96c8ed34c0f79e2ea811c5b53a6896b", "title": "Controllable Response Generation for Assistive Use-cases"}, {"paperId": "35eb6755b63c45ff44d05ace8ea1b3b8c8db9eee", "title": "On the Safety of Conversational Models: Taxonomy, Dataset, and Benchmark"}, {"paperId": "30873c32db5a219a58be928d5692cce48be1d3a0", "title": "Few-Shot Bot: Prompt-Based Learning for Dialogue Systems"}, {"paperId": "e35357ac461a669fe7e4b877ee1fad0dfda26303", "title": "Few-shot Controllable Style Transfer for Low-Resource Multilingual Settings"}, {"paperId": "a6d8d04962f84ae6225e72723869a002b9fc8036", "title": "What Changes Can Large-scale Language Models Bring?
