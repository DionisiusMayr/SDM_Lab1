While such systems (e.g. Apache Storm, Apache Flink) have achieved widespread use, they generally rely on sending data to a central computing cluster or data center to be processed, which means there are fundamental limits to (1) the end-to-end latency and (2) the network bandwidth used to communicate with the data center, particularly when the data to be processed is highly geo-distributed. In this report, we will survey some recent methods to extend DSPS to the geodistributed setting by executing stream processing jobs over a geo-distributed network of nodes. We will present representative papers from three different approaches: formal optimization techniques [1], extensions to the programming model [2], and using approximation to greatly reduce the size or frequency of data that needs to be sent between nodes [3]. We will discuss how these approaches differ, how they compare in terms of performance, and areas where future research is needed.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "20860470", "name": "C.
