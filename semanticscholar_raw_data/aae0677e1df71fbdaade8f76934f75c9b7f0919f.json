Segmentation is essential for the diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmias. Various computational and mathematical techniques have been used to this categorization. In this article, we present a novel computer framework for the categorization of CAs using the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset (MITDB) using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique as well as a network of convolutional neural networks (CNN). The PSO seeks to maximize accuracy & minimize category cross entropy error (CE) by optimizing hyper parameters that determine a CNN's layers of structure. In both training and testing, the suggested model discovered a good structure of layers in 0.044968 & 0.084768 days, respectively. These findings prove the validity of the suggested approach & show that it is a novel method for training CNNs since it eliminates the need for a human to manually set hyper parameter values for the network's layers.", "venue": "2023 International Conference on Data Science and Network Security (ICDSNS)", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2023-07-28", "journal": {"name": "2023 International Conference on Data Science and Network Security (ICDSNS)", "pages": "1-7"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2244005065", "name": "Saniya Khurana"}], "citations": []}
