The possibility of managing and processing GSBD to help decision-making therefore appears to be an important scientific and societal issue. This state of the art successively explores the concepts of big data, of spatial component and presents some main existing solutions for the management and processing of GSBD.", "venue": "Advanced Industrial Conference on Telecommunications", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2020-10-07", "journal": {"name": "2020 IEEE 14th International Conference on Application of Information and Communication Technologies (AICT)", "pages": "1-6"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2031498591", "name": "Yassine Loukili"}, {"authorId": "2053859686", "name": "Mohamed El Mehdi El Aissi"}, {"authorId": "83381347", "name": "Sarah Benjelloun"}, {"authorId": "3168436", "name": "Y.
