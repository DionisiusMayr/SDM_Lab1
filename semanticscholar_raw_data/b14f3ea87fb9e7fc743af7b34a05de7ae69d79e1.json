To validate the model, the data from two paper pulp presses with several pre-processing methods are utilized for predicting the units\u2019 conditions. The results of validation criteria show that pre-processing data using a LOWESS in combination with the Elimination of discrepant data filter achieves more stable results, the prediction error decreases, and the predicted values are easier to interpret. The model can anticipate future values with MAPE, RMSE and MAE of 1.2, 0.27 and 0.30 respectively. The errors are below the significance level. Moreover, it is identified that the best hyperparameters found for each paper pulp press must be different.", "venue": "Production &amp; Manufacturing Research", "year": 2022, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-12-23", "journal": {"name": "Production & Manufacturing Research", "volume": "11"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2047707277", "name": "B.
