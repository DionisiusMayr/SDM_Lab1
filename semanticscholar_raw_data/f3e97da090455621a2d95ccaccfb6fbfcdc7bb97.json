One possible technique with which to address this complexity is the use of abstraction. Reference architecture (RA) can be useful for an improved understanding of the main components of Big Data. Herein, we propose a security RA that includes the management of security concerns and provides the main elements of a Big Data ecosystem. Application of this architecture to real\u2010world scenarios facilitates its refinement and improves its usefulness. In this article, we present a case study of a real\u2010world Big Data ecosystem implemented in a banking environment. This ecosystem was developed by everis, an NTT company with which we collaborated for this study. To conduct this validation case study, a map was established between the elements of the Big Data ecosystem implemented and our proposal. Consequently, a series of valuable lessons that can improve both our architecture and the security of the Big Data environment were obtained. These include recommendations for a set of best practices such as the use of security patterns.", "venue": "Software, Practice & Experience", "year": 2020, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-03-31", "journal": {"name": "Software: Practice and Experience", "pages": "1520 - 1538", "volume": "50"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "152353447", "name": "Julio Moreno"}, {"authorId": "2111324890", "name": "Javier G\u00f3mez"}, {"authorId": "144831784", "name": "M.
