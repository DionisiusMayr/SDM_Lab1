It has also been a challenging task in remote sensing research. In recent years, deep neural networks have made great achievement in improving the accuracy of building extraction from remote sensing imagery. However, most of the existing approaches usually require a large amount of parameters and floating point operations for high accuracy, it leads to high memory consumption and low inference speed which are harmful to research. In this paper, we proposed a novel efficient network named ESFNet which employs separable factorized residual block and utilizes the dilated convolutions, aiming to preserve slight accuracy loss with low computational cost and memory consumption. Our ESFNet obtains a better trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, it can run at over 100 FPS on single Tesla V100, requires 6x fewer FLOPs and has 18x fewer parameters than state-of-the-art real-time architecture ERFNet while preserving similar accuracy without any additional context module, post-processing and pre-trained scheme. We evaluated our networks on WHU building dataset and compared it with other state-of-the-art architectures. The result and comprehensive analysis show that our networks are benefit for efficient remote sensing researches, and the idea can be further extended to other areas.
