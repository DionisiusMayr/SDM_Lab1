This has has fueled an increase in human genetics research. At the same time, with the recent advent of technologies in processing large data sets, lot of these technologies are proving valuable and efficient in analyzing these huge datasets. In this paper we use some of these technologies to analyze genetic sequencing data of 1000 Genomes Project,produce and evaluate a framework to process the sequencing data thereof and look into structural variations with respect to population groups.", "venue": "", "year": 2016, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Biology"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2016-06-30", "journal": {"name": "arXiv: Genomics", "volume": ""}, "authors": [{"authorId": "34494979", "name": "Kristiina Ausmees"}, {"authorId": "3469229", "name": "Pushpam Aji John"}], "citations": []}
