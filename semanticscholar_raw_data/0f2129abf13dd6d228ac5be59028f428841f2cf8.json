Here, we describe the FAIR-bioHeaders Reference genome (FHR), a metadata standard guided by the principles of Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse (FAIR) in addition to the principles of Transparency, Responsibility, User focus, Sustainability, and Technology (TRUST). The objective of FHR is to provide an extensive set of data serialisation methods and minimum data field requirements while still maintaining extensibility, flexibility, and expressivity in an increasingly decentralised genomic data ecosystem. The effort needed to implement FHR is low; FHR\u2019s design philosophy ensures easy implementation while retaining the benefits gained from recording both machine and human-readable provenance.", "venue": "bioRxiv", "year": 2023, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2023-12-01", "journal": {"name": "bioRxiv"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "66527379", "name": "Adam J.
